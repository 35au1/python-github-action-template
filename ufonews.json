            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "Studio Pierrot doomed Black Clover anime with its questionable choices and the series could have fared better at the hands of Ufotable.\n\nBlack Clover, the popular manga by Yuki Tabata, was picked up by Studio Pierrot for an anime adaptation in 2017. Since then, the series has amassed many fans but also a boatload of criticism, which mainly stems from Pierrot\u2019s treatment of the anime. This often makes fans wonder if an entirely different studio would have treated the series better.\n\nStudio Pierrot might be behind long-running series like Bleach and Naruto, but their animation of Black Clover was nowhere near the top shots. Studio Ufotable, on the other hand, took Demon Slayer and animated it to perfection with enough time and energy. And the sales numbers of the series speak volumes about the result.\n\nStudio Pierrot damned Black Clover by giving it the 2000s treatment\n\nBlack Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6 Black Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6 Black Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6 Black Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6\n\n\u00d7\n\nStudio Pierrot is known for animating long-running anime like Naruto, Bleach, Yu Yu Hakusho, and others. These series have weekly episode releases and not seasonal anime which is more prevalent during current times. While this approach worked in the 1990s or early 2000s anime, it is an obsolete system in the current anime era.\n\nAs a result, the Black Clover anime has sub-par animation at times, coupled with pacing issues. Studio Pierrot has several anime under them, which caused Black Clover to get the short end of the stick. The tight schedule, lack of time to develop better quality, lack of resources and less staff have definitely left an impact on the series.\n\nThe anime has considerably bad animation at times, with characters often missing characteristic features. Bad-quality fillers were included just to delay the anime from catching up to the manga, which in turn invited criticism. The tight deadlines tempted the studio to outsource the animation, and overall, Black Clover just deserved better. It is these concerns that lead fans to believe that the anime might have turned out much better had another studio taken over.\n\nStudio Pierrot\u2019s views were changed due to Ufotable\u2019s Demon Slayer\n\nDemon Slayer Sanemi vs Muichiro | Credit: Ufotable\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is an anime that changed the anime industry forever. The president of Studio Pierrot, Michiyuki Honma, himself admitted that the series was a major turning point for the industry. Honma realized that Demon Slayer was a high-quality work that took a lot of time as well as a generous budget to produce. Of course, the efforts were not wasted as the anime is currently one of the most popular anticipated series.\n\nMost studios have already shifted to seasonal anime releases, ditching the ages-old weekly episode schedule. The result is high-quality anime that is appreciated by the masses. Thus, the president confirmed that the studio is currently looking to create more anime that won\u2019t follow their old format.\n\nThis is good news for every weekly anime under Pierrot like Black Clover and Boruto. The introduction of the seasonal format would make sure that staff members won\u2019t be overworked and there won\u2019t be too many productions at a time. Having seasonal releases will also give plenty of time for the manga to progress, resulting in fewer filler episodes.\n\nBlack Clover manga is available to read on Viz Media, and the anime is currently streaming on Crunchyroll."

            "article_content": "Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan. Even before it got its anime adaptation, the title of one of this year\u2019s best shows feels like it was destined to be turned into rhythm. Thank god the Japanese band behind the anime\u2019s catchy and propulsive opening had the same idea, one that\u2019s compelled over 32 million views and counting on YouTube alone (and that\u2019s just one of its listings \u2013 there\u2019s another on Netflix\u2019s channel). The bouncy, fast-paced backing track already feels perfectly representative of this animated take on the manga by Yukinobu Tatsu, in a goofy, chaotic and idiosyncratic genre mash-up.\n\nThe show itself, directed by F\u016bga Yamashiro with animation produced by Science Saru, is similarly flexible. A marriage of science fiction and horror, reflections on contemporary urban living and age-old folklore, high school romance and hard-hitting action, there\u2019s a little bit of something for everybody. \"Dandadan\" is the story of Momo Ayase and Ken \u201cOkarun\u201d Takakura, two seemingly opposite classmates at school who are drawn together by a mutual fascination with the paranormal. Momo insists that ghosts and spirits are real, while Ken (whom Momo later nicknames Okarun) believes in aliens.\n\nNeither believe the other at first, before each land themselves into an encounter with those very things. Momo is abducted by aliens, Okarun is possessed by Turbo Granny, a spirit haunting a tunnel (and yes, Turbo Granny is the actual name of a spirit from Japanese urban legend). Both survive the experience, but gain strange new powers as a result, and use those to solve various hauntings and other abductions throughout this 12-episode run (with more to come next year). Not only that, but the two have to begin a search: during his possession by Turbo Granny, Okarun\u2019s balls got stolen.\n\nTurbo Granny in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAs well as the general mayhem that emerges it\u2019s fun seeing how each episode of \"Dandadan\" highlights its different building blocks: One episode might be more ghostly, the next leaning more into sci-fi, with some surprisingly long stretches dedicated to fleshing out the budding romance between Momo and Okarun. In action-oriented anime, romance is usually an afterthought, but in \"Dandadan\" it's one of the driving forces of the story \u2013 including arcs about communication and anxiety that are surprisingly sincere and generous about these feelings, while giving a lot of space for characters to figure out some tangled emotions.\n\nRelated The 12 biggest moments in animation in 2023\n\nIt\u2019s the balancing act to the rest of the show\u2019s sometimes willfully juvenile humor, which actually never tips into insufferable, just silly (though this is perhaps underselling how deranged the first couple of episodes are). The show has been a standout this year in part because of its sense of unpredictability as well as its sincere investment in its romance, and its eye-catching visual approach, which is perhaps not as experimental as the studio\u2019s other work has been (though one standout episode has an astonishing first person conceit), but it\u2019s consistently beautiful.\n\nThose \"Dandadan\" main titles\n\nDirected by Abel Gongora of \"Scott Pilgrim Takes Off\" fame, the viral opening credits encompass all of these sides to the show. The backing song \u2013 performed by a band called Creepy Nuts, oddly appropriate for this \u2013 first kicks things off with wild and energetic rapping before settling into a gentler, poppy hook, almost reflective of the tonal swings in the show that follows. It\u2019s also just an earworm, perhaps even surpassing Gongora\u2019s last efforts as director on the opening for Science Saru\u2019s \"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!!\" which also went viral in its day.\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun.\n\nThe animation itself complements these change-ups beautifully \u2013 shifting art styles as it moves from the quickfire montage of detailed, goofy expressions hinting at the main cast\u2019s personalities to the more heavily stylized touches, as the camera zooms out until the person in frame becomes a shape amidst a block color background. Interspersed throughout are some paintings of the various spirits and aliens, silhouetted against the block colors which within the show itself become strongly associated with them: each spiritual or alien encounter leading to the following scenes being taken over by that single block color. It\u2019s not just a hint at the show\u2019s own style, but a reference to its influences; many have noted that much of the opening refers back to that of the original \"Ultraman,\" the monsters from which have inspired a lot of those in \"Dandadan.\" This wild minute-and-a-half eventually settles into a hint at something more tender as the two main characters lean on each other and look at the stars.\n\nMomo in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun. There\u2019s giant crabs, guys running so fast they turn into a mess of jagged lines, there\u2019s a maneki-neko doll running around, there\u2019s dancing (modeled on moves from a Rihanna video, as pointed out by some eagle-eyed fans).\n\nIt speaks to something which has felt missing from a lot of television in recent years, as so many opening sequences have gotten tied up in feeling prestigious, leading down the same road of moody and atmospheric music over a montage of animated statues. Even the animated smash hit \"Arcane,\" which is more eclectic than even \"Dandadan\" in its visual approach, fell into this same trap as it relented to these prestige TV trends.\n\n\"Dandadan\u2019s\" opening, for all the influences it proudly presents, doesn\u2019t feel so anonymous. It has personality and energy, no anxiety about not being taken seriously. Admittedly, though on average they trend to being more, well, animated than a lot of TV main titles, anime opening and ending credits tend to follow their own medium's tropes. Think images of hands reaching out the sun, the protagonist running . . . somewhere, the cast falling out of the sky. You can get generic versions of these too; there\u2019s no ironclad rule, and Gongora\u2019s work on \"Dandadan\" (and \"Eizouken\") feel idiosyncratic within that space too.\n\nWhy not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?\n\nStill, they\u2019re at the pinnacle of a format which can sometimes feel like an afterthought, as television gets absorbed more and more into an age of \u201cSkip Intro\u201d buttons and streamers attempting to push you through to the next episode as soon as possible. It should be said that there are notable recent exceptions: think \"Peacemaker,\" \"Pachinko\" (I promise, I\u2019m not just naming intros with dance routines), \"Severance\" or \"Succession\" (there you go). These are shows with different priorities, yes, and anime like \"Dandadan\" is looking toward pop sensibilities rather than HBO\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s not TV\u201d mindset, something many treat as aspirational. But openings like this (and like \"Peacemaker\") are part of the fun, a chance to capture the show in microcosm, and chasing trends feels like it diminishes that chance.\n\nPerhaps this is all part of my wider problem with streaming, the expectation to get everything at once, ravenously consume it, and click to the next thing, rather than have fun with the ritual of television, of seeing something on a weekly basis and growing familiar with it. I can\u2019t get \"Dandadan\" out of my head, so I\u2019ll be coming back. Why not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?"

            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh's upcoming horror movie flips the haunted house subgenre on its head by having the whole movie shot from the ghost's perspective. But that's not the only strange thing about Presence, as Soderbergh says he found inspiration for the look of the movie in the most unlikely of places\u2026 a '00s ghost-hunting reality TV show.\n\n\"One of my favorite shows is Celebrity Ghost Stories. You've got to see it! You can tell people were traumatized by these experiences \u2013 they're not kidding around,\" Soderbergh says in the new issue of SFX magazine , which features Star Trek spin-off movie Section 31 on the cover and hits newsstands on December 31.\n\n\"What distinguished a lot of those stories was that they often didn't come with the trappings of a typical ghost experience as we've seen in the movies \u2013 they were very matter-of-fact,\" explains the director. \"I thought, 'Okay, that's interesting.'\"\n\nPremiering in 2009, Celebrity Ghost Stories is an American reality series that details accounts of paranormal happenings experienced by celebrities. Over the years, stars such as Carrie Fisher, Mickey Rooney, and Chaka Khan appeared on the show. A usual episode consists of the celebrity being interviewed about their experience whilst eerie B-roll, creepy music, and dramatic retellings play throughout.\n\nHowever, unlike many ghost-hunting series which take place during the night, Celebrity Ghost Stories opts to show the houses during the day. In that sense, we can see where the inspiration comes from. Presence, which follows a family who moves into a seemingly haunted suburban house, plays out chiefly during daylight as the haunting figure patrols the house.\n\nSo, if the ghost is behind the camera the whole time, who plays it? That would be the director himself. \"I'm used to being close to the actors as the camera operator, but this was a real dance that I was doing with the cast. It was fun, because I really got to share some of their performance anxiety as we were doing the scene\u2026 On occasion, a take would get ruined because I'd bumped into them, or got trapped in the wrong place because I timed my movement incorrectly.\"\n\nThe movie is written by Jurassic Park's David Koepp and stars Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland, and Julia Fox.\n\nSign up to the SFX Newsletter Get sneak previews, exclusive competitions and details of special events each month!

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "By Melissa Tribelhorn\n\nCEO/Executive Director, NWABR\n\nAs the Executive Director of the Northwest Association for Biomedical Research (NWABR), I have the privilege of working at the intersection of scientific discovery, ethics, and public trust. In the Pacific Northwest, we are home to some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge research institutions, where innovation and ethical responsibility go hand in hand. Nowhere is this more evident than in the burgeoning field of AI-driven tools in healthcare and biomedical research.\n\nWe recently hosted a panel on science and innovation. The October 7, 2024, NWABR event focused on addressing clinical research and the path to drug discovery. This pivotal half-day session of panel dialogues was designed to educate the public, policymakers, and key stakeholders about the essential support required to sustain the biomedical research community.\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in healthcare, accelerating drug discovery, improving diagnostics, and creating new pathways for personalized medicine. But as with any groundbreaking technology, it brings with it a host of ethical questions and challenges. How do we ensure that AI is used responsibly, transparently, and in a way that promotes health equity? How can we guarantee that the benefits of AI reach all patients, not just those with the most access to advanced care?\n\nAt NWABR, we see AI not only as a tool for advancing the science of discovery but also as a catalyst for fostering greater public trust in biomedical research. The Pacific Northwest\u2019s research community was built on a foundation of integrity, transparency, and a deep commitment to ethical research. As AI reshapes the landscape of medicine, we remain committed to upholding these values, ensuring that this technology is developed and used in ways that prioritize patient welfare and public trust.\n\nBuilding Trust Through Ethical AI\n\nOne of the most critical questions surrounding AI in healthcare is: how do we ensure the technology works for everyone? AI models often rely on vast amounts of data to make predictions, but without diverse, representative datasets, these models can inadvertently reinforce existing health disparities. For AI to truly drive health equity, it must be trained on data that reflects the diversity of the populations it serves. This is a key point of emphasis in our work at NWABR, where we promote ethical standards that demand inclusivity in research practices.\n\nWhen AI tools are used for diagnostics, such as detecting early signs of diseases like cancer or diabetic retinopathy, we must ensure they are accurate across all demographic groups. A model that works well for one population but fails for another does not serve the core mission of improving public health. It is essential that AI is developed with transparency and a commitment to addressing potential biases.\n\nCollaboration: A Key to Ethical Innovation\n\nTo navigate these challenges, NWABR fosters collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders. We believe that by working together, we can create AI solutions that are both innovative and equitable. This collaboration extends beyond the scientific community to include patients and the public, whose voices are crucial in shaping the ethical use of new technologies.\n\nAt NWABR, we are dedicated to educating the public about the ethical use of AI in healthcare. Through open dialogue, we strive to demystify the technology and build a shared understanding of its potential\u2014and its limitations. By bringing transparency to the forefront of these discussions, we help bridge the gap between scientific innovation and public trust.\n\nA Future of Ethical Innovation\n\nThe future of AI in healthcare is incredibly promising. It has the potential to revolutionize how we treat diseases, improve patient outcomes, and address some of the most pressing health challenges of our time. But as we move forward, we must do so with care. AI\u2019s power to shape the future of healthcare is immense, but it must be guided by a commitment to ethical conduct, transparency, and inclusivity.\n\nAt NWABR, we envision a future where the public not only trusts AI-driven innovations but recognizes their essential role in improving health outcomes for all. We will continue to lead the charge in promoting the ethical use of AI in biomedical research, ensuring that this transformative technology is developed with the highest standards of integrity.\n\nThrough ongoing collaboration, education, and a steadfast commitment to ethical principles, we can ensure that AI-driven healthcare fulfills its promise\u2014advancing science while upholding the values that define our biomedical community.\n\nFor more info about the NWABR, click here.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE : Sponsored Posts like this are paid, \u201cNative Advertisements\u201d that help businesses and organizations improve their internet presence and all-important SEO.

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, researchers think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Most of these hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nA flower persists in a patch of Ecuadorian forest\n\nResearchers found this new flowering plant species by chance, when they spotted a patch of forest along the road. The name Amalophyllon miraculum, reflects the \u2018miracle\u2019 of finding the plant in these unexpected fragments of protected forests. Currently, only two populations are known, both in small protected areas. This limited distribution has led to its preliminary assessment as Critically Endangered.\n\nThe area where the plant was found, known as Centinela, was once a vast, lush tropical forest, but is now largely cleared for agriculture. Experts estimate that 70-97% of western Ecuador\u2019s original forests have been destroyed since the mid-20th century. The remaining patches of Centinela forest are like islands of biodiversity amid a sea of farmland.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) model has just achieved human-level results on a test designed to measure \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d.\n\nOn December 20, OpenAI\u2019s o3 system scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, well above the previous AI best score of 55% and on par with the average human score. It also scored well on a very difficult mathematics test.\n\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is the stated goal of all the major AI research labs. At first glance, OpenAI appears to have at least made a significant step towards this goal.\n\nWhile scepticism remains, many AI researchers and developers feel something just changed. For many, the prospect of AGI now seems more real, urgent and closer than anticipated. Are they right?\n\nGeneralisation and intelligence\n\nTo understand what the o3 result means, you need to understand what the ARC-AGI test is all about. In technical terms, it\u2019s a test of an AI system\u2019s \u201csample efficiency\u201d in adapting to something new \u2013 how many examples of a novel situation the system needs to see to figure out how it works.\n\nAn AI system like ChatGPT (GPT-4) is not very sample efficient. It was \u201ctrained\u201d on millions of examples of human text, constructing probabilistic \u201crules\u201d about which combinations of words are most likely.\n\nThe result is pretty good at common tasks. It is bad at uncommon tasks, because it has less data (fewer samples) about those tasks.\n\nUntil AI systems can learn from small numbers of examples and adapt with more sample efficiency, they will only be used for very repetitive jobs and ones where the occasional failure is tolerable.\n\nThe ability to accurately solve previously unknown or novel problems from limited samples of data is known as the capacity to generalise. It is widely considered a necessary, even fundamental, element of intelligence.\n\nGrids and patterns\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark tests for sample efficient adaptation using little grid square problems like the one below. The AI needs to figure out the pattern that turns the grid on the left into the grid on the right.\n\nEach question gives three examples to learn from. The AI system then needs to figure out the rules that \u201cgeneralise\u201d from the three examples to the fourth.\n\nThese are a lot like the IQ tests sometimes you might remember from school.\n\nWeak rules and adaptation\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how OpenAI has done it, but the results suggest the o3 model is highly adaptable. From just a few examples, it finds rules that can be generalised.\n\nTo figure out a pattern, we shouldn\u2019t make any unnecessary assumptions, or be more specific than we really have to be. In theory, if you can identify the \u201cweakest\u201d rules that do what you want, then you have maximised your ability to adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat do we mean by the weakest rules? The technical definition is complicated, but weaker rules are usually ones that can be described in simpler statements.\n\nIn the example above, a plain English expression of the rule might be something like: \u201cAny shape with a protruding line will move to the end of that line and \u2018cover up\u2019 any other shapes it overlaps with.\u201d\n\nSearching chains of thought?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know how OpenAI achieved this result just yet, it seems unlikely they deliberately optimised the o3 system to find weak rules. However, to succeed at the ARC-AGI tasks it must be finding them.\n\nWe do know that OpenAI started with a general-purpose version of the o3 model (which differs from most other models, because it can spend more time \u201cthinking\u201d about difficult questions) and then trained it specifically for the ARC-AGI test.\n\nFrench AI researcher Francois Chollet, who designed the benchmark, believes o3 searches through different \u201cchains of thought\u201d describing steps to solve the task. It would then choose the \u201cbest\u201d according to some loosely defined rule, or \u201cheuristic\u201d.\n\nThis would be \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to how Google\u2019s AlphaGo system searched through different possible sequences of moves to beat the world Go champion.\n\nYou can think of these chains of thought like programs that fit the examples. Of course, if it is like the Go-playing AI, then it needs a heuristic, or loose rule, to decide which program is best.\n\nThere could be thousands of different seemingly equally valid programs generated. That heuristic could be \u201cchoose the weakest\u201d or \u201cchoose the simplest\u201d.\n\nHowever, if it is like AlphaGo then they simply had an AI create a heuristic. This was the process for AlphaGo. Google trained a model to rate different sequences of moves as better or worse than others.\n\nWhat we still don\u2019t know\n\nThe question then is, is this really closer to AGI? If that is how o3 works, then the underlying model might not be much better than previous models.\n\nThe concepts the model learns from language might not be any more suitable for generalisation than before. Instead, we may just be seeing a more generalisable \u201cchain of thought\u201d found through the extra steps of training a heuristic specialised to this test. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding.\n\nAlmost everything about o3 remains unknown. OpenAI has limited disclosure to a few media presentations and early testing to a handful of researchers, laboratories and AI safety institutions.\n\nTruly understanding the potential of o3 will require extensive work, including evaluations, an understanding of the distribution of its capacities, how often it fails and how often it succeeds.\n\nWhen o3 is finally released, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of whether it is approximately as adaptable as an average human.\n\nIf so, it could have a huge, revolutionary, economic impact, ushering in a new era of self-improving accelerated intelligence. We will require new benchmarks for AGI itself and serious consideration of how it ought to be governed.\n\nIf not, then this will still be an impressive result. However, everyday life will remain much the same.\n\nMichael Timothy Bennett, PhD Student, School of Computing, Australian National University and Elija Perrier, Research Fellow, Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology, Stanford University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nThe end of the year 2024 has brought reckonings for artificial intelligence, as industry insiders feared progress toward even more intelligent AI is slowing down. But OpenAI\u2019s o3 model, announced just last week, has sparked a fresh wave of excitement and debate, and suggests big improvements are still to come in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThis model, announced for safety testing among researchers, but not yet released publicly, achieved an impressive score on the important ARC metric. The benchmark was created by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, a renowned AI researcher and creator of the Keras deep learning framework, and is specifically designed to measure a model\u2019s ability to handle novel, intelligent tasks. As such, it provides a meaningful gauge of progress toward truly intelligent AI systems.\n\n\n\nNotably, o3 scored 75.7% on the ARC benchmark under standard compute conditions and 87.5% using high compute, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art results, such as the 53% scored by Claude 3.5.\n\nThis achievement by o3 represents a surprising advancement, according to Chollet, who had been a critic of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to achieve this sort of intelligence. It highlights innovations that could accelerate progress toward superior intelligence, whether we call it artificial general intelligence (AGI) or not.\n\nAGI is a hyped term, and ill-defined, but it signals a goal: intelligence capable of adapting to novel challenges or questions in ways that surpass human abilities.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 tackles specific hurdles in reasoning and adaptability that have long stymied large language models. At the same time, it exposes challenges, including the high costs and efficiency bottlenecks inherent in pushing these systems to their limits. This article will explore five key innovations behind the o3 model, many of which are underpinned by advancements in reinforcement learning (RL). It will draw on insights from industry leaders, OpenAI\u2019s claims, and above all Chollet\u2019s important analysis, to unpack what this breakthrough means for the future of AI as we move into 2025.\n\nThe five core innovations of o3\n\n1. \u201cProgram synthesis\u201d for task adaptation\n\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 model introduces a new capability called \u201cprogram synthesis,\u201d which enables it to dynamically combine things that it learned during pre-training\u2014specific patterns, algorithms, or methods\u2014into new configurations. These things might include mathematical operations, code snippets, or logical procedures that the model has encountered and generalized during its extensive training on diverse datasets. Most significantly, program synthesis allows o3 to address tasks it has never directly seen in training, such as solving advanced coding challenges or tackling novel logic puzzles that require reasoning beyond rote application of learned information. Fran\u00e7ois Chollet describes program synthesis as a system\u2019s ability to recombine known tools in innovative ways\u2014like a chef crafting a unique dish using familiar ingredients. This feature marks a departure from earlier models, which primarily retrieve and apply pre-learned knowledge without reconfiguration \u2014 and it\u2019s also one that Chollet had advocated for months ago as the only viable way forward to better intelligence.\n\n2. Natural language program search\n\nAt the heart of o3\u2019s adaptability is its use of Chains of Thought (CoTs) and a sophisticated search process that takes place during inference\u2014when the model is actively generating answers in a real-world or deployed setting. These CoTs are step-by-step natural language instructions the model generates to explore solutions. Guided by an evaluator model, o3 actively generates multiple solution paths and evaluates them to determine the most promising option. This approach mirrors human problem-solving, where we brainstorm different methods before choosing the best fit. For example, in mathematical reasoning tasks, o3 generates and evaluates alternative strategies to arrive at accurate solutions. Competitors like Anthropic and Google have experimented with similar approaches, but OpenAI\u2019s implementation sets a new standard.\n\n3. Evaluator model: A new kind of reasoning\n\nO3 actively generates multiple solution paths during inference, evaluating each with the help of an integrated evaluator model to determine the most promising option. By training the evaluator on expert-labeled data, OpenAI ensures that o3 develops a strong capacity to reason through complex, multi-step problems. This feature enables the model to act as a judge of its own reasoning, moving large language models closer to being able to \u201cthink\u201d rather than simply respond.\n\n4. Executing Its own programs\n\nOne of the most groundbreaking features of o3 is its ability to execute its own Chains of Thought (CoTs) as tools for adaptive problem-solving. Traditionally, CoTs have been used as step-by-step reasoning frameworks to solve specific problems. OpenAI\u2019s o3 extends this concept by leveraging CoTs as reusable building blocks, allowing the model to approach novel challenges with greater adaptability. Over time, these CoTs become structured records of problem-solving strategies, akin to how humans document and refine their learning through experience. This ability demonstrates how o3 is pushing the frontier in adaptive reasoning. According to OpenAI engineer Nat McAleese, o3\u2019s performance on unseen programming challenges, such as achieving a CodeForces rating above 2700, showcases its innovative use of CoTs to rival top competitive programmers. This 2700 rating places the model at \u201cGrandmaster\u201d level, among the top echelon of competitive programmers globally.\n\n5. Deep learning-guided program search\n\nO3 leverages a deep learning-driven approach during inference to evaluate and refine potential solutions to complex problems. This process involves generating multiple solution paths and using patterns learned during training to assess their viability. Fran\u00e7ois Chollet and other experts have noted that this reliance on \u2018indirect evaluations\u2019\u2014where solutions are judged based on internal metrics rather than tested in real-world scenarios\u2014can limit the model\u2019s robustness when applied to unpredictable or enterprise-specific contexts.\n\nAdditionally, o3\u2019s dependence on expert-labeled datasets for training its evaluator model raises concerns about scalability. While these datasets enhance precision, they also require significant human oversight, which can restrict the system\u2019s adaptability and cost-efficiency. Chollet highlights that these trade-offs illustrate the challenges of scaling reasoning systems beyond controlled benchmarks like ARC-AGI.\n\nUltimately, this approach demonstrates both the potential and limitations of integrating deep learning techniques with programmatic problem-solving. While o3\u2019s innovations showcase progress, they also underscore the complexities of building truly generalizable AI systems.\n\nThe big challenge to o3\n\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 model achieves impressive results but at significant computational cost, consuming millions of tokens per task \u2014 and this costly approach is model\u2019s biggest challenge. Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, Nat McAleese, and others highlight concerns about the economic feasibility of such models, emphasizing the need for innovations that balance performance with affordability.\n\nThe o3 release has sparked attention across the AI community. Competitors such as Google with Gemini 2 and Chinese firms like DeepSeek 3 are also advancing, making direct comparisons challenging until these models are more widely tested.\n\nOpinions on o3 are divided: some laud its technical strides, while others cite high costs and a lack of transparency, suggesting its real value will only become clear with broader testing. One of the biggest critiques came from Google DeepMind\u2019s Denny Zhou, who implicitly attacked the model\u2019s reliance on reinforcement learning (RL) scaling and search mechanisms as a potential \u201cdead end,\u201d arguing instead that a model should be able to learn to reason from simpler fine-tuning processes.\n\nWhat this means for enterprise AI\n\nWhether or not it represents the perfect direction for further innovation, for enterprises, o3\u2019s new-found adaptability shows that AI will in one way or another continue to transform industries, from customer service and scientific research, in the future.\n\nIndustry players will need some time to digest what o3 has delivered here. For enterprises concerned about o3\u2019s high computational costs, OpenAI\u2019s upcoming release of the scaled-down \u201co3-mini\u201d version of the model provides a potential alternative. While it sacrifices some of the full model\u2019s capabilities, o3-mini promises a more affordable option for businesses to experiment with \u2014 retaining much of the core innovation while significantly reducing test-time compute requirements.\n\nIt may be some time before enterprise companies can get their hands on the o3 model. OpenAI says the o3-mini is expected to launch by the end of January. The full o3 release will follow after, though the timelines depend on feedback and insights gained during the current safety testing phase. Enterprise companies will be well advised to test it out. They\u2019ll want to ground the model with their data and use cases and see how it really works.\n\nBut in the mean time, they can already use the many other competent models that are already out and well tested, including the flagship o4 model and other competing models \u2014 many of which are already robust enough for building intelligent, tailored applications that deliver practical value.\n\nIndeed, next year, we\u2019ll be operating on two gears. The first is in achieving practical value from AI applications, and fleshing out what models can do with AI agents, and other innovations already achieved. The second will be sitting back with the popcorn and seeing how the intelligence race plays out \u2014 and any progress will just be icing on the cake that has already been delivered.\n\nFor more on o3\u2019s innovations, watch the full YouTube discussion between myself and Sam Witteveen below, and follow VentureBeat for ongoing coverage of AI advancements."

            "article_content": "THE OpenAI, founded a decade ago as a research organization, is considering a change to the AI company\u2019s structure that would create a more conventional money-making corporation alongside a nonprofit arm.\n\nThe board is evaluating a plan that would turn OpenAI\u2019s business into a public benefit corporation\u2014an entity free to pursue income but with the goal of bettering society\u2014while retaining a nonprofit side, according to a blog post Friday. As part of the new structure, the nonprofit arm would hold shares in the moneymaking entity.\n\nBloomberg previously reported that the company was considering such a move and has been in talks with regulators in California and Delaware about the potential change. Friday\u2019s announcement signals that the board is poised to move forward with a restructuring.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s existing for-profit arm is currently controlled by its nonprofit organization. Under the proposal, the business would become a Delaware Public Benefit Corp., or PBC. The nonprofit entity would continue to exist as one of the \u201cbest-resourced nonprofits in history\u201d and would then hold a \u201csignificant interest\u201d in the for-profit arm, in the form of shares determined by independent financial advisers at a fair valuation, OpenAI\u2019s board said.\n\nWhen OpenAI was founded in 2015, it adopted the idealistic mission of building artificial intelligence that would be safe and beneficial to humanity. In 2019, OpenAI created the for-profit subsidiary to help fund the high costs of AI model development. By 2022, when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT chatbot, the company became a superpower in the artificial intelligence industry\u2014and put its operations under greater scrutiny.\n\nA simplified for-profit structure is considered more attractive to investors, although it could raise questions about whether the San Francisco-based company is sticking with its original public mission. Elon Musk, a co-founder and early investor in OpenAI, filed a lawsuit against the company in August accusing it of breaching an agreement to operate as a nonprofit. Musk recently asked a federal court to block OpenAI from pursuing a conversion to a for-profit business while his legal fight plays out.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board said the proposed plan will ensure the company\u2019s for-profit arm is successful in the long term. It will help the nonprofit raise funds and better execute on its mission, according to the post.\n\n\u201cWe once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined,\u201d the board said. \u201cInvestors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.\u201d\n\nThe board said the plan that it\u2019s considering would better equip OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education and science."

            "article_content": "A representational picture showing the OpenAI logo displayed on a phone screen on May 20, 2024. \u2014 Reuters\n\nAnnouncing restructuring plans, OpenAI said on Friday it would establish a public benefit company to make it simpler to \"raise more capital than it had imagined,\" and lift the restrictions placed on the firm by its present nonprofit parent.\n\nThe recognition and thorough justification for its high-profile restructuring confirmed a September Reuters story that provoked discussion among tech titans like Elon Musk and corporate watchdogs.\n\nAt issue were the implications such a move might have on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the ChatGPT maker's existing for-profit arm would become a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC) \u2014 a structure designed to consider the interests of society in addition to shareholder value.\n\nOpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment, as the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up.\n\nIts latest $6.6 billion funding round at a valuation of $157 billion was contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker could upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors within two years, Reuters reported in October.\n\nThe nonprofit, meanwhile, will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC in the form of shares as determined by independent financial advisers, OpenAI said in a blog post, adding that it would be one of the \"best resourced nonprofits in history.\"\n\nOpenAI started in 2015 as a research-focused nonprofit but created a for-profit unit four years later to secure funding for the high costs of AI development. Its unusual structure gave control of the for-profit unit to the nonprofit and was in focus last year when Sam Altman was fired as CEO only to return days later after employees rebelled.\n\n'Critical step'\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness,\" the Microsoft-backed startup said on Friday.\n\n\"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nIts plans to create a PBC would align the startup with rivals such as Anthropic and the Musk-owned xAI, which use a similar structure and recently raised billions in funding.\n\nAnthropic garnered another $4 billion investment from existing investor Amazon.com last month, while xAI raised around $6 billion in equity financing earlier in December.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business,'\" DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.\n\n\"This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public.\"\n\nThe startup could, however, face some hurdles in the plan.\n\nMusk, an OpenAI co-founder who later left and is now one of the startup's most vocal critics, is trying to stop the plan and in August sued OpenAI and Altman. Musk alleges that OpenAI violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI.\n\nOpenAI earlier this month asked a federal judge to reject Musk's request and published a trove of messages with Musk to argue that he initially backed for-profit status for OpenAI before walking away from the company after failing to gain a majority equity stake and full control.\n\nMeta Platforms is also urging California's attorney general to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nBecoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee in and of itself that a company will put its stated mission above profit, as that status legally requires only that the company's board \"balance\" its mission and profit-making concerns, said Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School.\n\n\"The only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public,\" she said. \"It doesn't actually have any real enforcement power behind it,\" she said.\n\nIn practice, it is the shareholders who own a controlling stake in the company who dictate how closely a public benefit company sticks to its mission, Lipton said."

            "article_content": "For anyone living under a social media rock, #vanlife has become one of the biggest viral trends of the last few years.\n\nTaking off during the pandemic, on TikTok the hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, with a further 15 million posts on Instagram.\n\nThe nomadic way of life is popular with (mainly) young people, and preceded the 'underconsumption core' lifestyle.\n\nGolden sunsets, expansive beaches, fairy lights and romantic filters; living out of a van is as Instagram aesthetic as it gets (on the surface).\n\nBut what about living out of an electric car? Could that be the most eco and luxury van life possible? Or is the reality just a photo opportunity but a holiday to avoid?\n\nThis is Money\u2019s Freda Lewis-Stempel took a new Tesla Model Y with its own specially designed 'Air Mattress' and \u2018Camp Mode\u2019 to one of the remotest islands in the UK to find out....\n\nCan you really sleep in a Tesla? This is Money's Motoring Reporter Freda Lewis-Stempel puts the electric car version of the #vanlife trend to a very remote test....\n\nHow the Model Y is designed for 'van life' glamping?\n\nIt makes sense to first explain how Tesla has taken the American \u2018van life\u2019 idea and added special features to the Model Y SUV to make it double up as a home on wheels.\n\nTesla Air Mattress: This \u00a3200 blow-up mattress has been designed to fit the rear of the car perfectly when the back seats are folded down. Penned on tracing paper, it has the cutouts in precisely the correct places in order for it to sit flush to the floor around wheel arches and arm rests.\n\nIt pumps up almost instantly when connected to the car's 12V outlet in the boot.\n\nJust roll the air mattress out, plug the air pump into the 12V, slot the air pump nozzle into the air mattress intake, turn the air pump on and watch it inflate.\n\nAt this point you can decide to go full glamping \u2018boujee\u2019 and bring a sheet, pillows and duvet like we did, or you can go more pop-up tent style and just use a sleeping bag and inflatable pillow.\n\nTesla has a specially shaped Air Mattress for its Model Y SUV that inflates to turn the car into a bed for the night\n\nTesla's Camp Mode is another sleeping-friendly feature that keeps the cabin at the perfect temperature overnight to make sure you don't get too hot or cold\n\nCamp Mode: Sort of genius from Tesla, Camp Mode maintains the optimum temperature and airflow within the cabin while you sleep so you don\u2019t wake up freezing cold or boiling hot in the middle of the night.\n\nIt also maintains the lighting setup you want or even music or a podcast if that helps you sleep.\n\nThere's even a Camp Profile which remembers your preferences and sets them automatically when you want to conk out for the night.\n\nTo enter Camp Mode, just tap the temperature menu icon on the bottom of the screen and select Camp (or use the Tesla app).\n\nSentry Mode, auto lock and the Model Y\u2019s alarm system are all disabled with Camp Mode so the alarm doesn\u2019t go off every time you exist - just remember to lock the car yourself while you sleep!\n\nWhy Scotland? Scotland is popular for wild camping because of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which gives everyone the right to access Scotland's outdoor spaces. You can park and camp by the side of the road as long as you aren't blocking access or parked dangerously. The Outdoor Access Code does stipulate you should camp away from roads, but campervans frequently park in larger lay-bys. As some of the most remote and dramatic countryside in the UK, especially on the islands, Scotland is also a brilliant place to put EV charging and range anxiety to the test too.\n\nDay 1/night 1: Regrettable decision? It can only get better...\n\nMy plucky school friend and I left London at around 5.30pm to drive up to the Peak District.\n\nIt was all going swimmingly, cruising up the M6 in the warm, extremely comfortable and smooth Model Y.\n\nThough I tend to find Teslas a bit clinical (or 'spaceship-y', as my friend said) for long journeys, their performance is undeniably strong.\n\nThe space, comfort, and how Teslas hold their range makes driving for hours minimum effort, and the Y was no different.\n\nDeciding to charge at the Superchargers near Stoke-on-Trent - because we didn't know how much range Camp Mode would use overnight - we snuck in the back door of a restaurant nearby to use the loo to brush our teeth and get ready for 'bed\u2019.\n\nThere were a few funny looks as we set the air mattress up for the night at the Superchargers (so we didn\u2019t have to figure it out for the first time in the middle of nowhere in the pitch-black Peaks), but it was very easy to set up.\n\nWhile the Y finished charging, we used the Theatre function - which has Netflix, YouTube, Hulu etc - to watch the different Christmas adverts on the touchscreen; Waitrose\u2019s \u2018who dunnit\u2019 was of course the clear winner.\n\nThanks to Tesla's Theatre suite we could watch all the Christmas adverts on YouTube while the car charged\n\nBrushing your teeth and washing your face in a restaurant loo near a Tesla Supercharger is the glamorous reality of Tesla living\n\nThen we drove off in search of our sleeping spot in the wild for the night.\n\nWe\u2019d pre-selected a place using the Park4night app, but driving up to a lay-by under a remote bridge and encountering just one guy and his camper van we got the heebie-jeebies and decided to find an alternative.\n\nThe only other option nearby was a lay-by/field gate entrance, and (after accidentally driving through someone\u2019s farmyard) we decided this was the best of two rather unappealing options, as it was already almost midnight.\n\nOff to bed (a bed that was as steep as Everest because the parking spot was on a sharp incline) I awoke just over four hours later at 4.55am.\n\nMy friend had seemingly disappeared. In a bleary state, I thought she'd been abducted, but thankfully she\u2019d just moved to the front seat to try and sleep.\n\nTurning the headlights on, we had a near heart attack (my second in 10 minutes) when they picked up a Land Rover Discovery that had silently turned up sometime between 12.40 and 4.55am.\n\nConvincing ourselves we weren\u2019t going to end up as front page horror story news, we tried to get back to sleep.\n\nIt was at this point we learnt two valuable EV glamping lessons: never park on an incline and an overinflated Air Mattress is, as I ruefully summarised, like sleeping on a slab of rock.\n\nWaking up in Leek in Staffordshire wasn't the most picturesque first wake up in the Tesla I'd envisioned as the beautiful countryside was hidden in fog and we'd had 4 hours of sleep each\n\nI failed to fall back to sleep, but my friend did, so I watched a very cold and wet dawn creep in through the windows and panoramic sunroof.\n\nI also watched two other cars come and go \u2013 one of which was a hunter\u2019s van containing three Hound of the Baskervilles-sized hunting dogs.\n\nIn the end, my friend and I ended up getting four hours sleep each.\n\nIt wasn't a great way to kick-off but thanks to the Camp Mode we were at least nice and warm. And, as only a year before we'd spent a night in the Peaks in minus five degrees on top a Jeep Wrangler in a Tentbox, we knew how absolutely brutal car 'glamping' really can be in cold weather.\n\nGoing for a brisk wake-up walk around 8am, we packed down the Air Mattress and set off for our pre-Scotland charging and feed stop at Tebay.\n\nDay 2/night 2: How much difference a day can make\n\nThe Tebay pit stop seriously perked us both up.\n\nThe car had a full charge on the Superchargers - we were charging to 100 per cent, which isn't as good for the battery as charging to 80 per cent but it's sensible for wilderness camping to have maximum range - while I managed a nap.\n\nThe nap was followed by a shower (you swap your car key for the shower key at Tebay and it\u2019s free to use), and we both scoffed full English breakfasts.\n\nThen it was back into the car for another three hours of driving up to Edinburgh for an afternoon 'city break'.\n\nThe roads were opening up and the scenery became road trip goals - in my opinion the best motorway driving in the UK is the Cumbria-Borders stretch - and everything was looking up.\n\nEdinburgh was a chance to get some steps and movement in, and a bit of big city excitement before the total and utter isolation that the next sleeping spot would bring.\n\nWe'd pre-planned to sleep in a very remote valley between Edinburgh and the Ardrossan ferry terminal where we had a 9am ferry to catch the next morning.\n\nI wanted to try Edinburgh public charging because it has a bad reputation, and although I did manage to find a charger, for a capital city Edinburgh charging has some way to go\n\nWe drove for about three hours to walk around Edinburgh and find some hot food before our next lay-by camp\n\nI also wanted to test Edinburgh's EV charging infrastructure because it has a bad reputation for being underprovided.\n\nIn reality this is unfortunately true - considering it\u2019s the capital of Scotland the charging options are pretty slim.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fussy and didn\u2019t mind what speed we charged, but that didn't really help. There weren't many chargers and almost all of them were in use.\n\nAnd unlike London, Edinburgh doesn't have lots of lamppost chargers, so all the on-street chargers are taken by residents.\n\nWe did, however, find one fast charger near George Street, so we walked around Edinburgh and had some hot food while the Model Y slow charged back up to 100 per cent.\n\nAt around 6pm we drove off to find our next Park4night place.\n\nThe second night camping location was the stuff of Instagram posts - although murky weather the remote Scottish hills were beautiful and it felt safe which led to a great nights' sleep\n\nThe Model Y has massive windows and a huge panoramic roof so you get 360 views when you wake up\n\nThis time we wanted the spot to be as isolated as possible, and we found it; a single-track road about 30 minutes from the coast without a soul in sight. Not a star, not an animal \u2013 nothing. And it felt so much safer.\n\nI should explain that my school friend and I both grew up in very remote parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire so having no-one around feels safer to us than having people nearby, but over people might entirely disagree with this logic.\n\nFeeling far more secure than night one allowed us to relax into our bedtime camping 'routine' (i.e. cleaning our teeth with water from a bottle).\n\nAnd we got the bed blowing-up level right this time, which meant the Air Mattress went from being a slab of rock to incredibly comfortable.\n\nWhile we could use the Tesla Model Y's Theatre mode again, part of the relaxation of camping is winding down reading a book\n\nThen we got the Camp Mode temperature perfect, read our books and drifted off to sleep in our very cosy hotel on wheels. We slept like logs.\n\nI woke about 6am to a glorious stormy Scottish dawn sky, and an empty valley of mountains.\n\nIt was everything I\u2019d thought Tesla living would be. And the night became an amusing memory.\n\nDay three/night three: Tesla living on the Isle of Arran - as good as glamping gets\n\nScotland has 'right-to-access' laws so it's much easier to camp in a car in Scotland than England. A place as remote as the Isle of Arran is a real test for glamping in an EV\n\nStarting off at 7.20am to drive 20 minutes for an ultra-rapid top-up before we boarded the Ardrossan car ferry, we pulled up at the InstaVolt chargers outside Stevenston McDonalds. Who doesn't love a retail park and a Maccies hash brown before 8am?\n\nThe loos gave us the chance to brush our teeth and clean our faces while the car went from around 80 to 100 per cent charge - after all, glamping is all about glamour.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range AWD has a range of 373 miles which gives you around 330/340 real world range.\n\nWe didn't actually need to be at 100 per cent before going across to the Isle of Arran - which is only 56 miles in circumference - but, while there are a few chargers in the 'capital' of Arran (Brodrick), ZapMap said they only take RFID cards so we played it very over safe.\n\nWe put the car on some Instavolt ultra-rapid chargers near the ferry port before we boarded\n\nWhile living out of a Tesla you have to find food and washing facilities wherever you can, and sometimes it's McDonalds or nothing (even at 8am)\n\nSentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app\n\nBoarding the Ardrossan ferry, we were in excellent EV company with the four cars nearest us all being EVs. Clearly range anxiety isn't a thing in the Scottish Isles.\n\nDuring the 55 minute crossing, Sentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app in general.\n\nI felt very smug knowing that the none of the many car alarms going off belonged to the Model Y because the Tesla app hadn't alerted me to any issues.\n\nWe also had far too much fun watching ourselves on the Sentry Mode cameras disembarking the ferry as we sat waiting for the cars in front to drive off.\n\nFor the rest of the day we drove around Arran, enjoying the freedom of the car and lack of time restraints, like hotel check-ins, and simply let nature lead us. We went for a walk, swam in the very cold sea, and watched the wildlife - Arran is famous for its seals.\n\nThe Isle of Arran only has four public chargers and you can only get a ferry to the mainland: There are three in Brodrick and one near Blackwaterfoot so you can really test range anxiety\n\nDriving around the Isle of Arran with no check-in times to abide by we could enjoy the scenery and outdoor pursuits to our own schedule\n\nTesla's cabin pre-conditioning feature on the app was also a godsend for when we wanted to come back to a warm car and heated seats and steering wheel after a freezing dip.\n\nWhile our day activities were quite messy, the Tesla and its vegan seats were very easy to keep clean.\n\nAs a living in a car goes it was remarkably easy to stay tidy and the vast storage throughout meant we were never short of space for our stuff.\n\nThe Model Y has 854 litres of boot space as well as a 117-litre frunk: more than enough space for all our 'glamping' stuff and the front trunk became a designated space for wet swimming costumes, towels and muddy boats.\n\nThe hooks above the passenger doors were also useful to hang our clothes to dry.\n\nThe Tesla has lots of space, and it was very easy to keep clean. Even if we left the bed in place, we still had plenty of space for our bags and the frunk meant we could separate wet clothes\n\nAlthough the Model Y has bi-directional charging (where you can power appliances from the car), we didn't take a kettle or camping chairs mainly because, without an awning or a settled camping spot, sitting outside in the bracing Scottish winter wind didn't seem very appealing.\n\nWhile the car means you can go anywhere, anytime, playing everything by ear also has its downfalls: We drove to get dinner at 6pm on the far side of the island only to be told the restaurant was fully-booked.\n\nAlthough we did eventually manage to have a very early dinner at a hotel near Brodrick, the Tesla glamping lesson of the day here would be to at least pre-book your meal reservations, especially if it's out of season.\n\nParked up against the sea, Tesla camping on the Isle of Arran is truly an amazing experience\n\nDuring the afternoon, we'd driven from the north west of Arran across to the north east and had passed many a lovely, big, isolated lay-by, noting a few that we'd be happy to park for the night in (frankly we were spoilt for choice on Arran).\n\nAmusingly (or mildly concerningly depending how you look at it), I'd turned to my friend as I eyed up one particular lay-by (the one we ended up choosing) and said; 'I'll never look at a lay-by the same way again'. She said she'd been thinking the exact same thing.\n\nIn the space of a few nights, Tesla camping had changed us - we'd become discerning connoisseurs of lay-bys. I will forever look at scenic lay-by and think 'that looks like a very nice place to spend the night in an EV'.\n\nIn the end, we chose one glorious lay-by near the sea, and with our glamping night routine down to a T, we settled in for our last sleep.\n\nWe watched Netflix's Nobody Wants This from our Air Mattress bed, thoroughly enjoying the Model Y mobile cinema offered to modern day EV nomads, and the brooding backdrop of the dark Scottish hills.\n\nWaiting to board the ferry back to mainland UK: Is Tesla glamping for the fainthearted? No. But is it a fantastic adventure? Yes.\n\nIt felt sad to say goodbye to our house on wheels on the drive home as we'd become quite attached\n\nThe next morning, after we had one last cold sea swim before boarding the ferry to begin our drive back to London, we both agreed we'd happily spend another three nights sleeping in the Tesla.\n\nLiving out of one? No. Glamping out of one again? Without a doubt.\n\nJust make sure your friends are up for an adventure and aren't at all precious..."

            "article_content": "An astronomical observatory, gold tongues found in mummies, a sword inscribed with the name of pharaoh Ramesses II and a 4,500 year-old attempt to treat cancer are just some of the interesting ancient Egyptian discoveries made in 2024. Here are 10 of the biggest discoveries from ancient Egypt this year.\n\nRelated: Possible bust of Cleopatra VII found at ancient Egyptian temple\n\nFirst astronomical observatory\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nArchaeologists uncovered what they believe is the first astronomical observatory ever identified in ancient Egypt. Dating back to the sixth century B.C., the L-shaped structure spans 9,150 square feet (850 square meters) and has a gateway to the east from where an observer could track the sun and stars. Archaeologists also found a large stone sundial and a carving of an observer watching the sun.\n\nGovernor's daughter\n\n(Image credit: Photo courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nThe tomb of Idi, a governor's daughter who lived during the reign of Senwosret I (circa 1961 to 1917 B.C.), was found in Asyut. She was buried in two coffins \u2014 one within the other. The coffins are covered with intricate texts that were intended to help the deceased find their way in the underworld. It's very rare to find intact coffins that date to this time period, archaeologists noted. While her tomb was robbed in ancient times, parts of her skeleton remain.\n\nGold tongues\n\n(Image credit: Image courtesy of Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nA number of gold tongues, dating back around 2,000 years, were found at the site of Oxyrhynchus. In January 2024 archaeologists announced the discovery of two gold tongues; then in December 2024 they noted that 13 more had been found at the site. Combine this with gold tongues found at the site in previous years and the total number found so far is at 29. The ancient Egyptians believed that gold tongues could help the deceased speak in the afterlife.\n\nRamesses II sword\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nA bronze sword inscribed with the name of pharaoh Ramesses II (ruled circa 1279 to 1213 B.C.) was discovered in the remains of a military barracks in the northwest Nile Delta. The sword was likely given to a high-ranking officer as a royal reward. The fact that it was found in a small room near an area where an enemy could infiltrate suggests that this sword was intended for fighting and wasn't just for show.\n\n4,300-year-old wall paintings show everyday life\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nA 4,300-year-old tomb decorated with wall paintings that depict scenes of everyday life was found at Dahshur. These scenes show donkeys threshing grain by trampling over it, ships sailing the Nile river and goods being sold at a market. The tomb belonged to an official named Seneb-Neb-Af and his wife Idet, who was a priestess of the goddess Hathor.\n\nCopper pollution in Great Pyramid harbor\n\nScientists found traces of heavy copper pollution in the harbor near the Great Pyramid, which was used to bring in materials and laborers. The harbor is dried up now, but the team analyzed its sediments. They determined that contamination peaked around 4,500 years ago, the time that the Giza Pyramids were built, with copper levels reaching five to six times the natural background level.\n\n30 ancient Egyptian tombs in Aswan\n\n(Image credit: EIMAWA/MoTA)\n\nArchaeologists discovered more than 30 tombs nestled in a hillside in Aswan. The tombs were in use between the sixth century B.C. and the second or third century A.D. Many of the burials consisted of families buried together. About 30% to 40% of the mummies in the tombs were children and newborns. Scientists also found that anemia and infectious disease were the most common causes of death.\n\nEvidence of 2,200-year-old hallucinogenic ritual found in vase depicting dwarf god\n\n(Image credit: Cassidy Delamarter)\n\nScientists found a blood-colored hallucinogenic concoction in a 2,200 year-old vase that depicts the dwarf god Bes. This is evidence that the Egyptians may have engaged in a hallucinogenic ritual that helped reenact a mythical story. In that story, the dwarf god Bes tricks the sky goddess Hathor. Hathor was in a bloodthirsty mood, but Bes gave Hathor an alcoholic beverage, spiked with a plant-based drug disguised as blood, that put her into a deep sleep of forgetfulness.\n\nAncient Egyptians tried to treat cancer 4,500 years ago\n\n(Image credit: Tondini, Isidro, Camar\u00f3s, 2024)\n\nScientists found evidence that the ancient Egyptians tried to remove a tumor from the skull of a man who lived around 4,500 years ago. The skull contained evidence of a large primary tumor as well as smaller tumors. Evidence suggests that someone tried to remove the cancer using metal surgical instruments. While the attempt was unsuccessful, it shows that the ancient Egyptians were trying to develop treatments for cancer at around the time the Giza pyramids were being built.\n\n2,100-year-old temple discovered hidden in cliff face\n\n(Image credit: Marcus M\u00fcller, Athribis Project)\n\nA 2,100-year-old temple was found hidden in a cliff face at the site of Athribis. Archaeologists excavating the temple there found a relief showing King Ptolemy VIII (reign circa 170 to 116 B.C.) offering sacrifices to the lion-headed goddess Repit and her son Kolanthes. They also found astronomical symbols such as two decans, or stars that enable people to tell the time at night. These decans were depicted with humanoid bodies and animal heads."

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "In What Ways Does AI Contribute to Startup Scalability?\n\nUnlock the secrets of how AI accelerates startup growth with in-depth analysis and insights from industry experts. Delve into the transformative power of AI across various business functions, from enhancing customer support to optimizing operational efficiency. This article sheds light on the pivotal role AI plays in driving scalability and innovation in today\u2019s competitive startup landscape.\n\nAI Automates Customer Support\n\nAI technologies contribute to the scalability of startups by automating repetitive tasks and enabling smarter decision-making, freeing up resources to focus on growth and innovation. One great example is the use of AI-powered customer support tools like chatbots.\n\nTake Intercom, for instance. By integrating AI-driven bots, startups can handle thousands of customer queries simultaneously without scaling their human support teams at the same pace. These bots use natural language processing to resolve common issues instantly or route more complex problems to the right person, ensuring efficient service while reducing operational costs.\n\nThis approach not only scales customer interactions as the startup grows but also gathers valuable data from these interactions, providing insights to refine products or services.\n\nChris Raulf, International AI and SEO Expert | Founder & President, Boulder SEO Marketing\n\nAI Revolutionizes Hiring Processes\n\nAI revolutionizes hiring processes, enabling startups to scale teams with unmatched speed and accuracy. It can analyze thousands of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, assess candidates, and predict cultural fit seamlessly. This ensures that scaling a workforce doesn\u2019t compromise the quality or diversity of hires. AI also reduces onboarding times by automating training modules tailored to individual roles effectively. Startups grow faster when talent acquisition becomes an AI-powered strategic advantage.\n\nWhen developing Toggl Hire, AI helped us create smarter candidate assessments tailored to skills. By analyzing test results, the system predicts a candidate\u2019s success probability for specific roles accurately. This reduced hiring times for startups using Toggl Hire, helping them scale teams quicker. The scalability of the tool itself brought exponential growth to our user base globally. It\u2019s proof of how AI-powered innovation fuels business expansion directly.\n\nAlari Aho, CEO and Founder, Toggl Inc\n\nAI Transforms Recruitment at X0PA\n\nAI has completely transformed how we approach scaling in recruitment at X0PA. By tapping into a pool of 250 million profiles worldwide, we enable companies to discover top talent even before a single job post goes live. Our AI doesn\u2019t stop at access-it curates profiles across LinkedIn and all major job boards, delivering a shortlist of only the most relevant candidates. This approach has saved recruiters over 100,000 days of manual effort, letting them focus on meaningful interactions instead of administrative tasks. Scaling with precision, speed, and reach is how we redefine modern recruitment.\n\nNina Alag Suri, CEO, XOPA AI\n\nAI Boosts Productivity and Efficiency\n\nThe biggest contribution of AI integration, whether in startups or established industries, lies in its ability to boost productivity and efficiency. Tasks that once took ten steps can now be completed in 5 or even 3, empowering employees to multitask without compromising focus\u2014a game-changer for startups.\n\nIn our case, integrating an AI chatbot for our real estate MLS website, The Canadian Home, was one of our best and most profitable decisions. As many of our users are first-time homebuyers, they naturally have countless questions. Initially, our customer support team was overwhelmed by the repetitive inquiries, making it hard to manage effectively. The AI chatbot now handles basic questions instantly, filtering out more straightforward queries and allowing our team to focus on more complex issues. This not only boosted efficiency but also increased conversions.\n\nAI is already transforming industries worldwide, and its role will only grow in the future. Adapting to these advancements is not just smart, it\u2019s essential.\n\nRobin Cherian, CEO, The Canadian Home\n\nAI Enhances Fraud Detection\n\nIn my experience, it enhances fraud detection for fintech startups. AI algorithms can quickly identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate potential fraudulent activity. AI-driven fraud detection systems like Feedzai or Kount analyze transactional data to identify suspicious activities. This saves time and resources for startups.\n\nA payments startup scaled safely by using AI to monitor real-time transactions, reducing fraud rates and building customer trust without deploying a large fraud investigation team. According to Feedzai, their technology helped the startup increase revenue by 30% and save $1.5 million in fraud losses within a year.\n\nI would point out that AI technologies help with fraud detection and assist in automating processes for startups. Many administrative tasks can be time-consuming and costly for startups, especially as they grow and onboard more customers or clients. AI-powered chatbots can handle common customer inquiries and support requests without the need for constant manual input from human employees.\n\nKevin Baragona, Founder @ DeepAI, Deep AI\n\nAI Improves Lead Qualification\n\nAI technologies help startups scale by automating repetitive tasks and providing insights that guide smarter decision-making. Startups often face limited resources, and AI allows teams to focus on high-value activities instead of getting stuck in operational bottlenecks.\n\nWe integrated AI into lead qualification. Instead of manually sorting and scoring leads, the AI models analyzed patterns from past sales data to prioritize prospects most likely to convert. This change reduced time spent on low-quality leads by 50 percent and allowed the sales team to focus on building relationships. Within six months, we saw a 30 percent increase in pipeline velocity.\n\nV. Frank Sondors, Founder, Salesforge AI\n\nAI Enhances Content Services\n\nOur development of AI-enhanced content services revealed a crucial insight about startup scaling.\n\nCombining AI efficiency with human expertise revolutionized our production capacity. Our HOTH AI Content Plus service slashed content creation time by 60% while maintaining quality standards. This breakthrough lets startups produce consistent, SEO-optimized content at scale without draining resources.\n\nNumbers tell the scaling story. By integrating AI into our content workflow, we\u2019ve helped startups produce in one month what used to take six months. The freed-up resources let them focus on growth strategies instead of content creation bottlenecks.\n\nSuccess in scaling requires strategic AI adoption. We found that using AI to handle initial drafts while keeping human editors for refinement creates the perfect balance. This model lets startups maintain quality while scaling operations \u2013 a winning formula I\u2019ve seen work across our 200,000+ client base.\n\nMy advice for startups: Start with one core process that directly impacts growth. Let AI handle repetitive tasks while your team focuses on strategy and creativity.\n\nMarc Hardgrove, CEO, The Hoth\n\nAI Empowers Efficient Scaling\n\nAI technologies empower startups to scale efficiently by automating repetitive tasks and delivering data-driven insights that enhance decision-making. For instance, integrating AI-powered chatbots in customer support allows startups to handle thousands of queries simultaneously, reducing the need for large support teams while ensuring 24/7 service. One example is a SaaS startup I worked with that implemented an AI-based lead-scoring system, which prioritized high-quality leads for the sales team. This not only increased conversion rates but also optimized resource allocation, enabling the business to scale its sales operations rapidly without proportionally increasing costs.\n\nJayanti Katariya, CEO, Moon Invoice\n\nAI Streamlines Customer Support\n\nAs someone who specializes in AI, I can say with confidence that AI adoption can really be a game-changer for startups. AI has two main advantages: it\u2019s fast and cost-friendly. Anything that has to do with repetitive tasks can be automated with AI, saving the company tons of time and human effort. At the same time, the teams can then focus on more strategic tasks that require contextual understanding, which AI obviously lacks. This way the work is distributed between humans and AI according to the strengths of both. On top of that, tasks related to data collection and analysis can be performed even better by AI. It does it faster and more accurately because there\u2019s no risk of human error. As a result, a well-executed adoption of AI can significantly speed up operations and improve the quality of work.\n\nOne example of a very common, yet extremely effective AI implementation is AI chatbots. We\u2019ve integrated one on our website as well. It can totally improve your customer service without you needing to put extra hours or effort into it. Your clients have access to real-time support 24/7, which creates a better user journey and increases customer satisfaction, both of which contribute to conversions. The company, at the same time, can focus more on improving the core products and big picture strategizing.\n\nPavlo Tkhir, CTO at Euristiq, Euristiq\n\nAI Automates Feedback Process\n\nAI has been a game-changer for Brokee in scaling our platform effectively. One example is how we\u2019ve integrated AI to automate the feedback process for our technical assessments. Instead of hiring additional team members to manually review every submission, our AI-driven system evaluates candidates\u2019 performance, generates personalized feedback, and even suggests tailored follow-up questions for hiring managers.\n\nThis automation not only ensures consistency and fairness but also allows us to handle significantly more users without compromising quality. By removing the bottleneck of manual evaluation, we\u2019ve been able to onboard more companies and engineers simultaneously, supporting our growth and expanding our impact in the hiring space. AI has made scaling not just possible but seamless.\n\nMaksym Lushpenko, Founder, Brokee\n\nAI Levels the Playing Field\n\nAI technologies have been an amazing tool to level-set startups, especially given their low cost of implementation.\n\nnDash is a bootstrapped company that often competes with brands well-funded by VCs. Integrations like OpenAI\u2019s API have enabled us to offer similar services and features without the added cost of capital.\n\nMachine learning was once accessible only to a few companies and has since been all but commoditized. We can now run powerful computations against large datasets that were all but impossible a few years ago. The biggest challenge is now just identifying implementations of value to content marketers and dreaming up the user interface.\n\nMatt Solar, Cofounder & VP of Marketing, nDash Marketing\n\nAI Transforms Customer Support\n\nIn my role at Windsor Drake, I once worked with a startup struggling to scale its customer support as their user base expanded rapidly. They were overwhelmed with routine Level 1 inquiries, and hiring more staff to keep up was becoming unsustainable. To address this, they integrated an AI-driven chatbot alongside cutting-edge voice AI technology to handle Level 1 customer requests. The voice AI, in particular, delivered human-like interactions that customers found surprisingly natural and well-received.\n\nThe impact was transformative. By automating Level 1 support, the startup freed up significant resources to focus on Level 2 and Level 3 support, where human expertise and problem-solving were crucial. This allowed them to address complex customer issues faster, improve overall service quality, and strengthen client relationships without increasing operational costs.\n\nWhat stood out most was how capital-efficient this solution was. Startups often face tight budgets, and this AI integration allowed them to scale customer service without burning through resources. For software startups especially, where customer satisfaction can make or break growth, leveraging AI for customer support isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s becoming a competitive necessity. The combination of cost-efficiency, scalability, and customer approval makes this a game-changing development that startups should actively explore.\n\nJeff Barrington, Managing Director, Windsor Drake\n\nAI Increases Marketing Scalability\n\nThe integration of AI technologies has dramatically increased the scalability of startups, particularly in marketing. Where previously a five-person team might have been necessary, many tasks can now be efficiently handled by a single individual, thanks to AI-powered tools.\n\nThis shift is particularly impactful for bootstrapped businesses, as it allows them to scale more profitably with less need for large teams or significant investment. AI enables startups to operate lean while still achieving impressive results.\n\nA concrete example from my experience is in email marketing. We used AI tools like Claude.ai to craft highly optimized onboarding sequences aimed at converting sign-ups into active clients. This whole process took about 2 hours, whereas previously this would have taken weeks. The quality of the AI-generated content was exceptional, and it significantly boosted our conversion rate from 30% to 38%.\n\nThis is just one instance of how AI can drive tangible improvements. Similar efficiencies can be found across various marketing functions, from content creation to data analysis and campaign optimization.\n\nStartups can now achieve the output and quality of much larger teams, allowing them to compete more effectively and scale more rapidly without proportional increases in headcount or costs.\n\nTom Van den Heuvel, CMO, wetracked.io\n\nAI Enables Unbelievable Automation\n\nThere is nothing that has improved our ability to scale startups like AI. You can write a Python script for any task, we have MCP setups (Model Context Protocol) that can access apps and programs on your Mac/PC to perform a plethora of tasks. It\u2019s really unbelievable. You just think of what you want automated and AI will make it happen. Sam Altman of OpenAI says we may see the first billionaire solo entrepreneur due to AI. Exciting times.\n\nNader Jaber, Founder, FlyNumber\n\nAI Optimizes Operational Efficiency\n\nThe integration of AI technologies plays a pivotal role in enabling startups to scale by optimizing operational efficiency and fortifying cybersecurity measures. It can also be used to automate routine processes and proactively address potential challenges. For businesses, this means reducing manual workload, improving resource allocation, and ensuring a secure foundation for growth. AI also enhances real-time decision-making by providing actionable insights from data, which is critical for scaling operations effectively without overburdening resources.\n\nAt GO Technology Group, we worked with an industrial manufacturing client in Chicago to implement an AI-enhanced cybersecurity solution that monitored their network 24/7 for anomalies. This allowed the organization to detect and respond to threats in real time, preventing potential breaches and downtime. The integration of AI not only streamlined their security operations but also freed up IT staff to focus on strategic initiatives, demonstrating how AI-powered managed IT services can drive both scalability and resilience in startup environments.\n\nSteve Robinson, Senior Technical Manager, Go Technology Group\n\nAI Drives Adaptive Pricing Models\n\nOne way AI drives scalability is through adaptive pricing models. I\u2019m not strictly talking about automating price changes but using AI to dynamically respond to market conditions, customer behavior, and inventory levels in real time, creating a competitive edge that startups often overlook.\n\nFor example, I worked with a SaaS startup that used AI to analyze customer segments, competitors\u2019 pricing, and seasonal demand patterns. Other than optimizing pricing for revenue, the system adapted to prioritize user acquisition in low-demand periods while maximizing revenue during peak times.\n\nDuring a major product launch, the AI model identified that a slightly lower introductory price for one user segment (freelancers) drove a 25% higher conversion rate while maintaining profitability because of the predicted long-term subscription retention. For larger enterprise clients, the AI suggested bundling features with tiered pricing, increasing adoption by 18% compared to static pricing.\n\nWhen you allow AI to continuously refine pricing, you can reduce churn rates and optimize customer acquisition costs, all without needing a massive pricing team or constant manual analysis. I\u2019d say you must explore adaptive pricing AI early. It\u2019s a strategic lever that can simultaneously improve margins and customer loyalty in ways static strategies simply can\u2019t.\n\nAljay Ambos, Lead SEO & Marketing Consultant, Twixify\n\nRelated Articles"

His Saturday snipe was his sixth of the month, one behind Brad Marchand, who has a team-high seven for the month.\n\nThe Bruins winger scored his eighth goal of the season in the club\u2019s 4-0 win over the Blue Jackets Saturday night at TD Garden . He added an assist on David Pastrnak\u2019s goal in the latest of a string of strong performances from Geekie, who has 16 points on the season.\n\nPlaying on the left side with Pastrnak and Pavel Zacha, Geekie had a simple explanation for his surge.\n\n\u201cJust kind of getting back to my game,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I had chances coming in and we were trying to find ourselves as a team too, but it\u2019s nice we strung a couple wins together and it was good to kind of help them produce and especially with the role playing with [Pastrnak] and [Zacha] and just trying to pitch in where I can and get those guys the puck, too. So yeah, just try to stick to my game and be responsible on both ends.\u201d\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nThe 6-foot-3-inch Geekie has one of the hardest and most accurate shots from outside the circles (see recent goals vs. the Sabres and Blue Jackets), but he also is adept at finding the soft spots in the high-traffic areas and converting from there (see his tally against the Flames).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, just trying to get lost I think is the big one. [Pastrnak] and [Zacha] are great players, and they draw a lot of attention, so I mean that whole shift I was just trying to get lost,\u201d Geekie said of his goal in Boston\u2019s 4-3 overtime win in Calgary.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really see me come on the ice, so I was trying to stay under the radar and Pasta made a great pass to [Mason Lohrei], and [Andrew Peeke] slid down. It\u2019s kind of everything that we talk about in here, and I just happened to be in the right spot. So, anytime you can get inside that house inside the dots, it helps a lot. And then pucks got to find you too, so just being in the right spots and got to get a little lucky too, so it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bruins are 7-0 when Geekie lights the lamp. He has 12 points in the past 15 games and goals in four of the past seven games. It\u2019s a small sample size, but that equates to a 40-goal pace. Geekie had career highs in goals (17) and points (39) last season, and with a strong second half, those numbers are well within reach.\n\nGeekie said one of the keys to the Bruins\u2019 recent success \u2014 they\u2019re 12-5-1 since Joe Sacco took over behind the bench and 20-14-4 overall \u2014 has been a \u201cless thinking, more doing\u201d attitude on the ice.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re getting there,\u201d Geekie said. \u201cI think the details for us are coming for sure. And I think you saw that as the game went on in Calgary and then in Vancouver, how well we can play when we just start playing hockey and stick to our systems and stuff.\n\n\u201cBut when we get away from that, that\u2019s when we start to struggle a little bit. So, our coaches are great about harping on us and staying honest about that, but we also take a lot of pride in that in the room. [Marchand] and the leadership group are good about staying on guys and staying accountable to themselves, too. So, just staying true to our game and playing to our strengths. And just sticking to that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgan Geekie celebrates with Mason Lohrei after scoring a goal against the Buffalo Sabres. Maddie Meyer/Getty\n\nBreaking away\n\nPastrnak\u2019s breakaway goal Saturday night (\u201cI had about 5-10 different thoughts in two seconds,\u201d he quipped) was the 361st of his career.\n\nSince the All-Star right winger\u2019s debut in the 2014-15 season, only Washington\u2019s Alex Ovechkin (446), Toronto\u2019s Auston Matthews (379), and Edmonton\u2019s Leon Draisaitl (371) have tickled the twine more in that span.\n\nEtc.\n\nBoston\u2019s win over Columbus stretched its home winning streak to six games. It\u2019s the Bruins\u2019 longest home run since 2022 when they won 14 straight on Garden ice from Oct. 15-Dec. 3. ... Jeremy Swayman\u2019s 14th career shutout moved him past Andy Moog (13) for 12th place on the Bruins all-time list. Who\u2019s No. 1? Tiny Thompson cooked up 74 bagels between 1928 and 1939. ... The Bruins won\u2019t be back on Garden ice until Jan. 5 against the Islanders. They\u2019ll play a New Year\u2019s Eve matinee in Washington followed by a game against the Rangers at Madison Square Garden Thursday, and a Saturday night affair in Toronto.\n\nJim McBride can be reached at james.mcbride@globe.com.

            "article_content": "Managing expenses effectively is crucial to maintaining financial integrity. However, the rise in fraudulent expense claims poses a significant challenge for organizations worldwide. Fraudulent activities not only drain resources but also damage trust within the workplace. Detecting such fraud manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. This is where machine learning comes into play, offering innovative ways to combat expense fraud efficiently and proactively.\n\nWhat Is Expense Fraud?\n\nExpense fraud refers to the act of submitting false or exaggerated claims for reimbursement. Employees may manipulate receipts, inflate mileage claims, or create fake invoices to gain undeserved compensation. Common examples of expense fraud include:\n\nSubmitting personal expenses as business-related costs.\n\nAltering the amounts on genuine receipts.\n\nCreating entirely fictitious receipts or invoices.\n\nReimbursing duplicate claims for the same expense.\n\nThese fraudulent activities can cost businesses thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually. While traditional audits can uncover some discrepancies, they often miss more sophisticated schemes. This highlights the need for advanced technologies like machine learning to tackle fraud more effectively.\n\nThe Role of Machine Learning in Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning (ML) leverages algorithms that analyze data, learn patterns, and make predictions. Unlike rule-based systems, ML models continuously improve over time as they process new data. In the context of expense fraud detection, machine learning offers the following advantages:\n\nAutomated Data Analysis: ML systems can process vast amounts of expense data in real time, identifying anomalies that may signal fraudulent behavior.\n\nPattern Recognition: By analyzing historical data, machine learning models can detect unusual patterns that deviate from normal expense behaviors.\n\nRisk Scoring: ML algorithms assign risk scores to expense claims, flagging those with high likelihoods of fraud for further review.\n\nAdaptive Learning: As fraud tactics evolve, machine learning models adapt by learning new patterns and identifying emerging threats.\n\nKey Machine Learning Techniques for Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning employs various techniques to identify fraudulent expense claims. Below are some of the most commonly used approaches:\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the outcomes (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) are already known. The model learns to classify new expense claims based on the patterns it observes in the training data. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks are commonly used in supervised learning for fraud detection.\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n\nUnlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. This approach is ideal for detecting unknown types of fraud. Techniques like clustering and anomaly detection help group similar data points and identify outliers. For instance, if an employee\u2019s expense claim is significantly higher than their peers\u2019, the system flags it for investigation.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNatural language processing is used to analyze text-based data, such as descriptions in expense claims. NLP can identify inconsistencies, suspicious keywords, or unusual phrasing that may indicate fraudulent intent.\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement learning involves training models through a reward-based system. In fraud detection, the algorithm receives rewards for accurately identifying fraudulent claims and penalties for false positives or negatives. This iterative process improves the model\u2019s accuracy over time.\n\nBuilding an Effective Machine Learning Framework for Fraud Detection\n\nImplementing a machine learning-based expense fraud detection system requires careful planning and execution. Below are the critical steps:\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nThe first step is gathering expense-related data, such as receipts, invoices, and transaction records. Preprocessing this data is crucial to ensure accuracy and consistency. Steps include:\n\nCleaning and removing duplicate entries.\n\nConverting unstructured data into structured formats.\n\nNormalizing numerical data for better model performance.\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering involves selecting and creating relevant variables (features) that help the model identify fraud. Examples include:\n\nFrequency of claims per employee.\n\nAverage claim amount by department.\n\nExpense categories with unusually high costs.\n\nModel Training and Testing\n\nOnce features are defined, the next step is training machine learning models. A portion of the data is used for training, while the rest is reserved for testing. This ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.\n\nDeployment and Monitoring\n\nAfter successful testing, the model is deployed to monitor expense claims in real-time. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are essential to maintain effectiveness and adapt to new fraud patterns.\n\nChallenges in Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection\n\nWhile machine learning offers powerful tools for expense fraud detection, it is not without challenges. Some common obstacles include:\n\nData Quality Issues: Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to unreliable model predictions.\n\nHigh False Positives: Over-sensitive models may flag legitimate claims as fraudulent, leading to inefficiencies.\n\nEvolving Fraud Tactics: Fraudsters continuously adapt, requiring models to be updated regularly.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Handling sensitive financial data necessitates strict adherence to data protection regulations.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving robust data governance, regular model audits, and input from domain experts.\n\nBenefits of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nDespite the challenges, machine learning brings numerous benefits to expense fraud detection:\n\nEfficiency: Automating fraud detection reduces the manual workload, allowing finance teams to focus on high-priority tasks.\n\nAccuracy: ML models often outperform traditional methods, identifying subtle patterns that humans might miss.\n\nScalability: Machine learning systems can handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for organizations of all sizes.\n\nCost Savings: By preventing fraud, businesses can save significant amounts of money that would otherwise be lost.\n\nReal-World Applications of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMany organizations have successfully implemented machine learning to combat expense fraud. For instance:\n\nCorporate Finance Departments: Large corporations use ML tools to monitor employee expense reports, flagging anomalies in real-time.\n\nExpense Management Software: Companies like Expensify and Concur integrate machine learning algorithms to provide fraud detection features for their clients.\n\nFinancial Institutions: Banks and credit card companies employ ML models to detect suspicious transactions that could indicate fraudulent expense claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpense fraud is a pressing issue that requires proactive measures to mitigate its impact on businesses. Machine learning offers a transformative solution, enabling organizations to detect and prevent fraud with unprecedented efficiency.Furthermore, By leveraging techniques like supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, companies can build robust fraud detection systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Although challenges remain, the benefits of machine learning far outweigh the drawbacks, making it an indispensable tool in the fight against expense fraud. Organizations that invest in this technology not only safeguard their finances but also foster a culture of transparency and trust."

And then, unfortunately, these explosions and sounds never stopped. And basically, until now, it's over 600 days since the war started in Sudan. We stayed in our house for three weeks, and then we started getting out of running out of food and water and electricity. And then moving out was a must,\u201d Elsaim says.\n\nAccording to Elsaim, those hit the hardest by climate change were the most vulnerable, including the millions displaced by the fighting.\n\n\u201cThe war in Sudan caused more than 12 million refugees and IDPs,\u201d Elsaim notes.\n\n\u201cThe biggest number of IDPs were concentrated in these states where it was flooded. The total area that was flooded is bigger than Germany in its size and definitely had a lot of the camps inside of it. Currently, Sudan is living the biggest humanitarian crisis ever,'' she adds.\n\nShe's calling for more humanitarian aid, and for aid to be adapted to withstand the effects of extreme weather.\n\n\u201cWe must consider climate change when we are planning for humanitarian interventions. Making climate sensitive humanitarian is not a privilege right now. It's a key and it's a must, basically. Otherwise, all of our humanitarian efforts will just flood with the water,'' Elsaim insists.\n\nWith regular droughts and significant variations in rainfall, Sudan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the UN.\n\nThe conflict between the Sudanese Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out in April 2023; since then, at least 20,000 have been killed."

            "article_content": "Over two years ago, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot that revolutionized the industry. What began as a small project swiftly grew into the fastest-growing app in history (before Threads dethroned it later that year), currently boasting 200 million active users. One thing is evident even though its effects on businesses and daily life are still evolving: ChatGPT has been a huge boon for Big Tech.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the six largest tech companies \u2013 Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia \u2013 have added over $8 trillion in market value since its launch.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWhen ChatGPT went live, it kicked off an AI boom, getting people and businesses excited about new possibilities. Nvidia, for one, has skyrocketed to become one of the world's most valuable companies, even taking the number-one spot at times. AI demand has boosted its chip sales and positioned it as the backbone of this growing tech revolution. By December 2024, Nvidia's market cap had surged by an incredible $3 trillion, recovering from a $54 billion drop in value in January 2023 relative to ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, according to a report by Visual Capitalist.\n\nMicrosoft's trajectory has been similarly remarkable. After losing $194 billion in January 2023, its market cap rebounded by $1.2 trillion by December 2024, supported by growing AI and cloud adoption. Amazon's valuation followed suit, climbing by $1.1 trillion in November 2024. Meta and Alphabet saw big gains, too, with companies growing by $1.1 trillion and $845 billion in market cap by late 2024, respectively.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nDespite its initial volatility, Apple saw a recovery. By December 2024, its market capitalization had grown from losing $345 billion in January 2023 to gaining $1.1 trillion.\n\nAs companies of all sizes rushed to implement AI solutions, cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google experienced tremendous growth. According to Crunchbase data, generative AI businesses have been consuming venture funds, making up about 35% of all VC funding this year.\n\nHaving recently raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, OpenAI has grown into a behemoth comparable to firms like AT&T and Goldman Sachs.\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nChatGPT vs. Google\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing shake-up is ChatGPT's rising challenge to Google's dominance in search. A survey showed ChatGPT now captures 5% of the search market, up from 1% in June, with Millennials leading the way.\n\nBut Google won\u2019t be going down without a fight. According to 71% of users, its Gemini AI and new search functions are still more popular than ChatGPT. Nevertheless, even a small shift in search market share is worth billions.\n\nOpenAI has taken aggressive steps to compete, rolling out a full search feature and partnering with Apple to make ChatGPT more accessible. Whether it can monetize these efforts as effectively as Google remains to be seen.\n\nIn the end, despite AI\u2019s huge impact, established tech firms have reaped the most rewards. High costs and competition from big firms make it difficult for startups to compete. Smaller startups often focus on niche markets like health care and law to avoid competing with the internet giants.\n\nRead Next:"

            "article_content": "New York Daily News editorial board (TNS)\n\nYork Dispatch\n\nImmigration is essential to America\u2019s health, otherwise we would be losing population and heading to a downward economic spiral. According to Census Bureau figures published Thursday, international migration accounted for about 84% of the country\u2019s roughly 3.3-million-person increase between 2023 and 2024; without it, the U.S. population would be without a shadow of a doubt stagnating.\n\nIn fact, newcomers pushed our populace growth to nearly 1%, its fastest rate in 23 years, proving that political calls by Donald Trump and others to close our borders are dumb as well as wrong.\n\nIncoming First Pal Elon Musk has long been preoccupied with birthrates in the highly developed nations, adopting the line that these countries are headed to a sort of extinction. Just Saturday, he was back on the topic, using his social media megaphone to warn that \u201cJapan and many other countries face population collapse.\u201d\n\nMORE:York City mayor vetoes immigrant protections on eve of Trump taking office\n\nThere are a number of public policy interventions that could conceivably help the crisis as Musk envisions it. There could be big increases in housing for would-be families who can barely keep their heads above water in small or shared houses and apartments. There could be safety net fiscal policies like an expanded child income tax credit and child care subsidies to make the decision to have children seem financially feasible in the long run.\n\nYet, the No. 1 policy solution to a declining working-age population and its strains on the economy and the social safety system is the one answer that Trump and Musk won\u2019t embrace: immigration.\n\nThere is no substitute; no one has found an alternative, anywhere. Japan is on the brink of population disaster because they\u2019ve tried every solution except a broader loosening of immigration laws.\n\nOnly recently, in the face of an ever-worsening crisis, have the Japanese lurched towards the obvious, too late to head off some of the painful effects of a warped population pyramid: too few young workers to support too many retired seniors. And the problem keeps getting worse as birth rates decline.\n\nEurope is on the same path of declining populations, stubbornly refusing to accept that the much-maligned waves of recent immigration have been a lifeline. The anti-immigrant rhetoric has been so acute that an anti-immigration far-right extremist in Germany \u2014 ironically himself an immigrant \u2014 just attacked a holiday market, killing at least five and injuring hundreds.\n\nThe United States\u2019 global primacy, the very idea of American exceptionalism itself, rests entirely on a base of mass immigration that has fueled our growth with newcomers from around the world. The immigrants and their descendants then become Americans. This is not and has never been a matter of opinion; opponents will claim that this idea is \u201cwoke\u201d or globalist or any number of other loose ideological terms because they cannot refute it on the merits.\n\nThere is no American Century, no dollar as reserve currency, no unmatched military, no soft power, no cultural dominance, no scientific preeminence, no industrial might without the absorption of talent and labor from everywhere else. We can only hope this most fundamental of American ideals survives the second Trump era, before irreversible damage is done.\n\n\u2014 New York Daily News editorial board (TNS)"

            "article_content": "I still can\u2019t quite believe that I\u2019m using an Arm-powered Windows laptop every day. After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance \u2014 and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you\u2019re not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be \u201cthe year of the AI PC,\u201d but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm. If 2024 was anything to go by, 2025 is going to be even bigger for Windows on Arm.\n\nMicrosoft set the stage for the 2024 year of Windows on Arm announcements in January at CES with promises of AI PCs and the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years. Laptop manufacturers started putting a Copilot key on keyboards early this year, providing quick access to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant. While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it\u2019s still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears.\n\nAfter the Copilot key was met with a lukewarm reception, Microsoft reignited the Mac vs. PC war a few months later. Inside Microsoft, confidence had gradually been growing throughout the early months of 2024 that it could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air after falling behind for years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the company\u2019s new Copilot Plus PC devices at a special event in May, setting the stage for a summer of Windows on Arm laptops from every major OEM.\n\nThe processor is the key\n\nThe key to Windows on Arm\u2019s revival this year was Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They\u2019ve provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple\u2019s MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft\u2019s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple\u2019s MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac\u201d guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple\u2019s laptop dominance.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best Windows laptops available right now. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it\u2019s now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can\u2019t be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft\u2019s improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft\u2019s efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance.\n\nIntel didn\u2019t sit still while all this Windows on Arm hype was occurring, nor AMD. Intel struck back with Lunar Lake at IFA in September, delivering impressive performance and battery life improvements. AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen AI chips are also competing directly with Qualcomm, and both AMD and Intel have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting for an M4-powered MacBook Air, Apple did refresh its cheapest MacBooks in October with a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM. Apple would probably argue it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence, but the unusual change came months after Copilot Plus PCs launched, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM at price points that challenge the MacBook Air. Apple did manage to squeeze its new M4 chip into the MacBook Pro recently, though, showing that Qualcomm has some ground to make up in 2025.\n\nApple and Microsoft have both been focusing on AI-powered features for laptops this year, and the end results have been underwhelming on both sides. While a lot of the initial Copilot Plus PC buzz was around Windows on Arm, Microsoft also rolled out some Windows AI features on these devices in June.\n\nIncomplete Recall\n\nThe flagship feature was supposed to be Recall, a feature that snapshots mostly everything you do on a laptop and then lets you recall moments or scroll through a timeline of how you\u2019ve used your PC. But because Recall was met with privacy and security concerns, undermining Microsoft\u2019s entire Copilot Plus PC marketing effort, Microsoft was forced to delay Recall several times to improve its security. In fact, it has only recently appeared in test versions of Windows.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Microsoft\u2019s stumbles with Recall will mean the company slows down with its Windows AI efforts. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri recently told me that the very future of Windows is about cloud and AI, so expect a lot more of this in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly focusing on Windows AI features like Recall. Image: Microsoft\n\nComing in 2025\n\nNext year will also be a fascinating battle between x86 and Windows on Arm. AMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, and Intel is facing a period of turbulence after ejecting its CEO, facing desktop chip issues, and a wave of layoffs earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll see more of those at CES in January, alongside the usual slew of laptops that set the stage for the year.\n\nThe Dell leak also hinted at Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU plans, which now look set for a CES announcement. Leaks suggest we\u2019ll see RTX 50-series desktop GPUs and even the laptop variants, with OEMs rumored to be preparing new models to show at CES. Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025.\n\nNvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025. Nvidia\u2019s expertise in AI chips and gaming could certainly shake up the Windows laptop world and make Windows on Arm even more enticing."

            "article_content": "Gitpod, a cloud development environment platform, recently decided to move away from Kubernetes after six years of use and experimentation. This decision emerged from their experience of managing development environments for 1.5 million users, while handling numerous environments daily.\n\nChristian Weichel, CTO and co-founder, and Alejandro de Brito Fontes, staff engineer at Gitpod, elaborated the journey to this decision in a blog post. Gitpod found that while Kubernetes is well-suited for production workloads, it presents significant challenges when used for development environments.\n\nThe nature of development environments also contributed to these challenges. Unlike production workloads, development environments are highly stateful and interactive, with developers deeply involved in their source code and changes. They show unpredictable resource usage patterns and require elaborate permissions and capabilities, often needing root access and the ability to install packages. These factors make development environments different from the typical application workloads and inform Gitpod's infrastructure decisions.\n\nInitially, Kubernetes was ideal for Gitpod's infrastructure due to its scalability, container orchestration, and rich ecosystem. However, when they scaled, they encountered numerous challenges, particularly in security and state management. Resource management started posing challenges, with CPU and memory allocation per environment being particularly problematic. The spiky nature of CPU requirements in development environments made it difficult to predict when CPU time would be needed, leading to various experiments with CPU scheduling and prioritization.\n\nStorage performance optimization was another critical area of focus. Gitpod experimented with various setups, including SSD RAID 0, block storage, and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). Each approach had its trade-offs in terms of performance, reliability, and flexibility. Backing up and restoring local disks proved to be an expensive operation, requiring careful balancing of I/O, network bandwidth, and CPU usage.\n\nAutoscaling and startup time optimization were important goals for Gitpod. They explored various approaches to scale up and ahead, including \"ghost workspaces,\" ballast pods, and eventually, cluster-autoscaler plugins. Image pull optimization was another crucial aspect, with Gitpod trying numerous strategies to speed up image pulls, including daemonset pre-pull, layer reuse maximization, and pre-baked images.\n\nNetworking in Kubernetes introduced its own set of complexities, particularly in terms of development environment access control and network bandwidth sharing. Security and isolation posed significant challenges, as Gitpod needed to provide a secure environment while giving users the flexibility they need for development. They implemented a specific user namespace solution to address these challenges, which involved complex components such as filesystem UID shift, mounting masked proc, and custom network capabilities.\n\nThere was an interesting conversation on Hacker News related to Gitpod\u2019s journey. One of the HN users, datadeft, referenced the original k8s paper in a response and said,\n\nthe only use case was a low latency and a high latency workflow combination and the resource allocation is based on that. The generic idea is that you can easily move low latency work between nodes and there are no serios repercussions when a high latency job fails. Based on this information, it is hard to justify to even consider k8s for the problem that gitpod has.\n\nIn search of better solutions, Gitpod experimented with micro-VM technologies like Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, and QEMU. While these offered some promising features like enhanced resource isolation and improved security boundaries, they also introduced new challenges in terms of overhead, image conversion, and technology-specific limitations.\n\nUltimately, Gitpod concluded that achieving their goals with Kubernetes was possible but came at a tradeoff in terms of security and operational overhead. This learning led them to develop a new architecture, Gitpod Flex, which carries over important aspects of Kubernetes such as control theory and declarative APIs while simplifying the architecture and improving the security foundation.\n\nGitpod Flex introduces abstraction layers relating to development environments and eliminates much of the unnecessary infrastructure. This new architecture allows for smooth integration of devcontainers and the ability to run development environments on desktop machines. It can be deployed self-hosted quickly and in any number of regions, providing more control over compliance and flexibility in modeling organizational boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, Gitpod's journey highlighted the importance of choosing a system based on its ability to improve developer experience, lower down operational burden, and improve the bottom line, rather than simply choosing between Kubernetes and alternatives. To know more about Gitpod Flex architecture, interested readers can watch this deep-dive session."

And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this.

Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "An astronomical observatory, gold tongues found in mummies, a sword inscribed with the name of pharaoh Ramesses II and a 4,500 year-old attempt to treat cancer are just some of the interesting ancient Egyptian discoveries made in 2024. Here are 10 of the biggest discoveries from ancient Egypt this year.\n\nRelated: Possible bust of Cleopatra VII found at ancient Egyptian temple\n\nFirst astronomical observatory\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nArchaeologists uncovered what they believe is the first astronomical observatory ever identified in ancient Egypt. Dating back to the sixth century B.C., the L-shaped structure spans 9,150 square feet (850 square meters) and has a gateway to the east from where an observer could track the sun and stars. Archaeologists also found a large stone sundial and a carving of an observer watching the sun.\n\nGovernor's daughter\n\n(Image credit: Photo courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nThe tomb of Idi, a governor's daughter who lived during the reign of Senwosret I (circa 1961 to 1917 B.C.), was found in Asyut. She was buried in two coffins \u2014 one within the other. The coffins are covered with intricate texts that were intended to help the deceased find their way in the underworld. It's very rare to find intact coffins that date to this time period, archaeologists noted. While her tomb was robbed in ancient times, parts of her skeleton remain.\n\nGold tongues\n\n(Image credit: Image courtesy of Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nA number of gold tongues, dating back around 2,000 years, were found at the site of Oxyrhynchus. In January 2024 archaeologists announced the discovery of two gold tongues; then in December 2024 they noted that 13 more had been found at the site. Combine this with gold tongues found at the site in previous years and the total number found so far is at 29. The ancient Egyptians believed that gold tongues could help the deceased speak in the afterlife.\n\nRamesses II sword\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nA bronze sword inscribed with the name of pharaoh Ramesses II (ruled circa 1279 to 1213 B.C.) was discovered in the remains of a military barracks in the northwest Nile Delta. The sword was likely given to a high-ranking officer as a royal reward. The fact that it was found in a small room near an area where an enemy could infiltrate suggests that this sword was intended for fighting and wasn't just for show.\n\n4,300-year-old wall paintings show everyday life\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities)\n\nA 4,300-year-old tomb decorated with wall paintings that depict scenes of everyday life was found at Dahshur. These scenes show donkeys threshing grain by trampling over it, ships sailing the Nile river and goods being sold at a market. The tomb belonged to an official named Seneb-Neb-Af and his wife Idet, who was a priestess of the goddess Hathor.\n\nCopper pollution in Great Pyramid harbor\n\nScientists found traces of heavy copper pollution in the harbor near the Great Pyramid, which was used to bring in materials and laborers. The harbor is dried up now, but the team analyzed its sediments. They determined that contamination peaked around 4,500 years ago, the time that the Giza Pyramids were built, with copper levels reaching five to six times the natural background level.\n\n30 ancient Egyptian tombs in Aswan\n\n(Image credit: EIMAWA/MoTA)\n\nArchaeologists discovered more than 30 tombs nestled in a hillside in Aswan. The tombs were in use between the sixth century B.C. and the second or third century A.D. Many of the burials consisted of families buried together. About 30% to 40% of the mummies in the tombs were children and newborns. Scientists also found that anemia and infectious disease were the most common causes of death.\n\nEvidence of 2,200-year-old hallucinogenic ritual found in vase depicting dwarf god\n\n(Image credit: Cassidy Delamarter)\n\nScientists found a blood-colored hallucinogenic concoction in a 2,200 year-old vase that depicts the dwarf god Bes. This is evidence that the Egyptians may have engaged in a hallucinogenic ritual that helped reenact a mythical story. In that story, the dwarf god Bes tricks the sky goddess Hathor. Hathor was in a bloodthirsty mood, but Bes gave Hathor an alcoholic beverage, spiked with a plant-based drug disguised as blood, that put her into a deep sleep of forgetfulness.\n\nAncient Egyptians tried to treat cancer 4,500 years ago\n\n(Image credit: Tondini, Isidro, Camar\u00f3s, 2024)\n\nScientists found evidence that the ancient Egyptians tried to remove a tumor from the skull of a man who lived around 4,500 years ago. The skull contained evidence of a large primary tumor as well as smaller tumors. Evidence suggests that someone tried to remove the cancer using metal surgical instruments. While the attempt was unsuccessful, it shows that the ancient Egyptians were trying to develop treatments for cancer at around the time the Giza pyramids were being built.\n\n2,100-year-old temple discovered hidden in cliff face\n\n(Image credit: Marcus M\u00fcller, Athribis Project)\n\nA 2,100-year-old temple was found hidden in a cliff face at the site of Athribis. Archaeologists excavating the temple there found a relief showing King Ptolemy VIII (reign circa 170 to 116 B.C.) offering sacrifices to the lion-headed goddess Repit and her son Kolanthes. They also found astronomical symbols such as two decans, or stars that enable people to tell the time at night. These decans were depicted with humanoid bodies and animal heads."

            "article_content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nImagine standing on a railway platform watching a trolley go past. A girl on the trolley drops a bright red ball. To her, the ball falls straight down. But from the platform, you see the ball traverse an arc before hitting the trolley floor. The two of you observe the same event, but from different reference frames: one anchored to the trolley and the other to the platform.\n\nThe idea of reference frames has a storied history in classical physics: Isaac Newton, Galileo, and Albert Einstein all relied on them for their studies of motion. A reference frame is essentially a coordinate system (a way of specifying positions and times relative to some zero point, or \u201corigin\u201d) that might itself be in motion. Einstein used reference frames to develop his theories of relativity, which revealed that space and time are not fixed backdrops to the universe, but rather elastic entities that can stretch, scrunch, and warp.\n\nBut quantum physics has for the most part ignored reference frames. Alice and Bob, the fictional observers in many experiments in quantum physics, typically have different physical locations, but they\u2019re assumed to have a common reference frame. This is now changing. Quantum physicists are realizing that they can\u2019t ignore the fact that the reference frame Alice is anchored to (akin to the trolley or the platform) might have multiple possible locations at once. Or that the clock Bob is using to measure time might be subject to quantum uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIn the quantum world, the reference frames should [also] be described by the formalism of quantum theory,\u201d said Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nIn a paper this year, the physicist \u010caslav Brukner at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information and the University of Vienna and colleagues showed that quantum reference frames put a new perspective on long-studied quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. The findings lead Renner to suspect that quantum reference frames might help resolve some of the weird paradoxes that arise in quantum thought experiments."

            "article_content": "Over two years since the introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2013 a quick and easy way to ask an AI model almost anything \u2013 artificial intelligence has continued to dominate talks, headlines and economic research and will likely continue to do so throughout the following year.\n\nFrom algorithms powering search engines to sophisticated tools diagnosing medical conditions, artificial intelligence is reshaping industries, redefining work and challenging our understanding of intelligence itself.\n\nAI is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it is rapidly becoming an integral part of life. But with breakneck innovation, the near future likely holds even more transformative change shaped by the key trends driving this revolution.\n\nWhile generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have mainly shaped these trends until now, what appears to be the dawn of a new era is so-called agentic AI.\n\nDescribed basically as \"a combination of different AI techniques, models, and approaches,\" it is seen as \"a new breed of autonomous agents that can analyze data, set goals and take action to achieve them, all with minimal human supervision.\"\n\nAccording to many companies, experts and recent reports, this trend looks to be the dominant trend that could shape the artificial intelligence sector next year.\n\nBut what more to expect? Let's break it down:\n\nOpenAI transition\n\nTalking about AI means talking about the company, which some call \"consequential\" in the field \u2013 and yes, that's OpenAI.\n\nSam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, has just recently said surprise advancements could be in store next year.\n\n\"I expect that in 2025 we will have systems that people look at, even people who are skeptical of current progress, and say, 'Wow, I did not expect that,'\" Altman said, speaking at the New York Times' DealBook Summit earlier this month.\n\nReflecting on the time when ChatGPT was launched, Altman also said, \"My guess is we will hit AGI (artificial general intelligence) sooner than most people in the world think, and it will matter much less.\"\n\nHis remarks came ahead of the announcement of the startup's new o3 model and details on the transition from being a non-profit entity, as it has been classified so far.\n\nUnder the plan announced on Friday, OpenAI said it looks to revamp its structure, saying it would create a public benefit corporation to make it easier to \"raise more capital than we'd imagined\" and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current non-profit parent.\n\nAI future, multimodality\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody knows the truth. I\u2019m sure there will be another explosion at some point where there\u2019s a fundamental change in the architecture of the models. Don\u2019t know when and don\u2019t know where,\" Pascale Fung, director of the Center for AI Research (CAiRE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told Anadolu Agency (AA) when asked about the future of AI.\n\nAI systems capable of processing multiple data types simultaneously, such as text, images, audio and video, have become a driving force in the industry toward what has been called multimodality.\n\nFung, also a senior director of AI research at Meta-FAIR, a research initiative by Facebook's parent company Meta, highlighted the significance of such a shift.\n\n\"That\u2019s not just text. It\u2019s not just a chatbot, but it can also see what you see and hear what you hear.\"\n\nMultimodal systems, like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, already integrate vision and auditory perception with text-based capabilities.\n\nThese technologies analyze visual or auditory data in real-time, enabling applications like assisting visually impaired individuals by describing their surroundings or reading text aloud.\n\nAI agents\n\nOne step forward from chatbots, AI agents are redefining assistance by managing complex, multistep tasks.\n\nUnlike chatbots that answer questions, AI agents can perform complex tasks, like booking a family vacation or managing executive schedules, Fung explained. These agents function as \"smart humans,\" using tools to solve problems and create value.\n\nPascale Fung, senior director of AI Research at Meta and a chair professor of Electronic & Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST) delivers a speech during a panel on artificial intelligence at TRT World Forum, Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye, Nov. 30, 2024. (AA Photo)\n\nIn a recent report, Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry at Microsoft Copilot, described agents as \"the apps of the AI era.\"\n\n\"Agents will begin to transform every business process, revolutionizing the way we work and manage our organizations,\" he added.\n\nThe possibilities are vast. As virtual travel planners, AI agents could optimize itineraries. As executive assistants, they can schedule meetings and manage workflows with nuanced judgment, able to juggle a multitude of factors playing into the decisions these would involve.\n\nEchoing these views and providing details on the concept of AI agents, Kristina Tikhonova, Microsoft General Manager for Southeast Europe, told earlier in an interview with Daily Sabah that \"AI agents represent a new era where AI systems work together seamlessly, with one AI agent able to request actions from others.\"\n\nSome large companies have already launched their agent products in this direction. Salesforce, for example, created Agentforce, and Microsoft has shared the concept of creating autonomous agents with Copilot Studio.\n\nNew frontiers\n\nYet, despite significant advancements, current AI systems still fall short of matching human intelligence in most areas \u2013 something that could only be achieved by what has been called artificial general intelligence or AGI.\n\nAt the same time, a dilemma also prevails over the question of the actual benchmark for achieving this.\n\nOften referred to as the \"holy grail\" of AI, developing an AGI system would represent a significant leap toward artificial superintelligence (ASI), systems capable of surpassing human cognitive abilities across multiple domains.\n\nWhile AGI is defined by its ability to achieve human-level intellectual performance, ASI goes further, outperforming humans in reasoning, problem-solving and creative tasks.\n\nOpenAI's Altman has predicted that superintelligence could emerge within a \"few thousand days,\" marking a profound paradigm shift.\n\nIn the near term, AI systems are expected by 2025 to solve increasingly complex problems with advanced reasoning skills.\n\nAdvanced AI models, such as OpenAI o1, already exhibit capabilities that mimic human reasoning, enabling tasks such as contract analysis, scientific discoveries and multistep project execution. Such capabilities are expected to develop in the coming years.\n\nComputational power, spending\n\nMoreover, behind AI\u2019s rapid advancements lies unprecedented progress in computational power.\n\nGoogle recently revealed its landmark quantum chip, Willow, able to complete a benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take today\u2019s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, the company claimed.\n\nThis breakthrough highlights the potential to overcome current computational limits, enabling advanced AI models to tackle previously insurmountable challenges.\n\nGoogle Quantum AI's Hartmut Neven (L) and Anthony Megrant (R) examine a cryostat refrigerator for cooling quantum computing chips at Google's Quantum AI lab in Santa Barbara, California, U.S., Nov. 25, 2024. (Reuters Photo)\n\nHowever, the energy demands of such systems raise environmental concerns. Industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are expected to prioritize sustainable, energy-efficient technologies to mitigate these impacts.\n\nSome of these tech giants, alongside Amazon and Meta, have already moved toward nuclear energy as data centers powering artificial intelligence and cloud computing are pushing energy demand and production to new limits.\n\nOn the other hand, all this has resulted in unprecedented AI-related spending, which made artificial intelligence and crypto a top story of the tech market in 2024.\n\n\"Some of the biggest winners in this year\u2019s stock market rally that\u2019s seen the Nasdaq jump 33% and other U.S. indexes notch double-digit gains have direct ties to the rapid advancements in AI. Chipmaker Nvidia is among them, but it\u2019s not alone,\" a report by CNBC said recently.\n\nA slowdown?\n\nHowever, after two years of fierce upward momentum, some analysts continue to wonder whether an AI slowdown is imminent.\n\nA recent report by The New York Times, titled \"Is the Tech Industry Already on the Cusp of an A.I. Slowdown?\" said, \"Interviews with 20 executives and researchers showed a widespread belief that the tech industry is running into a problem that too many were unthinkable just a few years ago. They have used up most of the digital text available on the internet.\"\n\nIt also cited Demis Hassabis, one of the most influential AI experts in the world and this year's recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AI research contributions to protein structure prediction, to have a warning for the rest of the tech industry.\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 co-laureate British AI researcher Demis Hassabis gestures as he gives his Nobel Prize lecture in Aula Magna, Stockholm University, Sweden, Dec. 8, 2024. (AFP Photo)\n\n\"Don\u2019t expect chatbots to continue to improve as quickly as they have over the last few years,\" he said.\n\nWith an apparent peak in data and rapid proliferation, it remains to be seen how major companies would move forward to fine-tune models, work on reasoning and their next key strategies.\n\nBroader applications, impact\n\nOften described as a sort of new \"industrial revolution,\" AI also brings a long list of impacts and transformations within. From aspects involving jobs to a possible tremendous impact on fields such as health care, AI is on track to be more integrated and involved in everyday lives as time passes.\n\nFung, for example, underlined AI\u2019s potential in agriculture: to revolutionize productivity, disease detection and water regulation.\n\n\"It can help eradicate hunger by ensuring more equitable food production and distribution,\" Fung explained. Improvements in logistics could also reduce food waste, addressing global challenges of hunger and inefficiency, she said.\n\nThe integration of AI into daily life has also sparked concerns about job displacement.\n\n\"Every major technological achievement has resulted in significant job shifts,\" Altman acknowledged.\n\nHowever, Fung emphasized that while AI will replace some roles, it will also create new opportunities. \"A lot of jobs we have today didn\u2019t exist 100 years ago,\" she said, urging that what is important is to be prepared for change.\n\nShe suggested that education systems must adapt to prepare individuals and teach them \"what makes us human.\"\n\nShe said schools should teach people the \"collective wisdom of humanity\" such as philosophy, the arts, literature, science, and mathematics and advised people to become more critical, creative and knowledgeable to deter the effects of AI."
