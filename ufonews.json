            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

            "article_content": "The year 2024 has turned out to be a big year for Apple. Until last year, everyone mocked the Cupertino tech giant for being unable to develop its AI-driven features. Interestingly, 2024 turned the game as Apple has finally stepped into AI. First previewed at WWDC 2024, Apple Intelligence is Apple\u2019s name for AI, which now sits at the core of its iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. It brings a suite of AI features to compatible devices, which includes the latest iPhones, A17 & M-series iPads, and Apple Silicon Macs. However, rather than releasing its AI venture in one go, Apple launched its AI features in waves over 2024, and more will arrive in 2025.\n\nIn October, the tech titan launched the first wave of Apple Intelligence features with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 which brought Writing Tools, a Clean Up tool, Notification Summaries, redesigned Siri UI, Call Recording, and more. The next wave arrived in December with iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, bringing Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT Integration, Visual Intelligence, and more. While 2024 has been an amazing year, Apple\u2019s AI-ambitious will finally take flight in 2025. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s more in store with Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple Intelligence: The Beginning of Something BIG in 2024\n\nEarlier, Apple was criticized for the delayed rollout of its Apple Intelligence system. The giant rolled out the first version of iOS 18 without any AI features. In fact, the iPhone 16 models, the first-ever iPhones built for AI, arrived without any Apple Intelligence features right out of the box. Despite all the criticism and mockery, Apple Intelligence maintained its hype and impressed users despite a delayed and staggered rollout.\n\nFans were overjoyed when Apple launched its first set of AI features with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Since then, the giant has earned all the praise for its impressive and practical AI features that can actually make your life easier. Beyond its features, Apple has made headlines for its smart approach to AI. The giant learned from the mistakes of competitors and launched its AI system with a unique strategy.\n\nWhat differentiates Apple from other players in the AI league is the fact that Apple lets you use AI in your everyday lives, with a BIG focus on privacy. Yes, you\u2019ve heard it right! Apple\u2019s Intelligence system will maintain your privacy while you use AI features on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Also, unlike other AI players such as Google and Microsoft, Apple has no plans to charge for its AI features.\n\nIn short, Apple Intelligence marks a big and bold move that could change the way how we interact with our devices.\n\nApple Intelligence Features Available Right Now\n\nApple released its first serving of AI features in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, and expanded them with iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 updates. Here are all the major Apple Intelligence features available right now:\n\nWriting Tools: With AI-powered Writing Tools, you can rewrite texts, proofread paragraphs, adjust the tone, get a summary out of selected text, and more. You can also pull out key points from a long paragraph, turn data & numbers into a table, make a list, and do much more with Writing Tools.

While Apple had rolled out the redesigned Siri with a new UI and ChatGPT Integration, some Siri features are set to arrive in 2025. Since its preview, Siri has been praised for its ability to understand the user\u2019s personal context. across notes, mail, messages, and more. Therefore, you could ask Siri things like flight details saved in the Mail app or a lunch plan you discussed with your friend. However, this personal context will come sometime in 2025.\n\nImage Credit: Apple\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Apple is also working on an \u201cOnscreen awareness\u201d feature which will allow Siri to understand and respond to what\u2019s currently displayed on your screen. For instance, if you\u2019ve opened a document on your iPhone, you can ask Siri to send the contents to a supported app. Also, Siri will offer more in-app actions, for both first and third-party apps. For instance, Siri\u200c could edit a photo for you and then email it to someone, or fetch a PDF from your email and save it to the Files app.\n\nThese new capabilities arriving with iOS 18.3 or iOS 18.4 in 2025 would definitely make Siri more capable and interesting.\n\nPriority Notifications\n\nIn 2025, Apple will also roll out the Priority Notifications feature that will show you the most important or urgent notifications first. With this Apple Intelligence feature, more urgent notifications like a meeting reminder or booking confirmation will be pushed to the top of the notification stack. This way, you can know what to pay attention to at a quick glance.\n\nImage Credit: Apple\n\nThis upcoming Apple Intelligence feature will be a savior for users who have a loaded notification center, which often leads to missing out on the important ones.\n\nSketch Style for Image Playground\n\nDebuted with iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, Image Playground brought the first set of image generation capabilities for Apple users. At the moment, Image Playground lets you try out Animation and Illustration image styles. There\u2019s a third style called Sketch, which Apple will add in 2025. Apple describes the Sketch style as \u201can academic and highly detailed style that uses a vibrant color palette combined with technical lines to produce realistic drawings.\u201d Sketch style would be different from the Animation style which provides a 3D cartoon look and the Illustration style which creates a flatter, 2D image.\n\nGenmoji on Mac\n\nWith macOS 15.2, Macs got support for Image Playground, but the Genmoji integration is currently available in macOS 15.3 beta. As of now, you can create Genmoji on iPhone and iPad. If you wish to try custom AI-powered emojis on Mac right now, you\u2019ll have to install macOS 15.3 beta on your machine.\n\nHonestly, installing the beta version isn\u2019t on your primary device isn\u2019t a practical option as it might have unexpected bugs, glitches, and performance issues. To use Genmoji on a Mac with the stable macOS version, you\u2019ll have to wait until 2025.\n\nMemory Movies on Mac\n\nWith iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, Apple added the brand-new Memory Movie feature that creates a story you wish to see. All you have to do is enter a description and Apple Intelligence will find the best photos and videos that match. It then crafts a storyline, chooses a perfect song, and arranges your photos into a beautiful memory movie with a narrative arc. Currently, Memory Movies are only available on iPhones and iPads. Interestingly, 2025 will bring support for Memory Movies on Mac.\n\nSupport for more languages\n\nCurrently, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available to all countries and regions. With iOS 18.1, Apple first launched AI features in English (United States). The tech titan then expanded it to English (Australia), English (Canada), English (Ireland), English (UK), English (New Zealand), and English (South Africa), with the recent iOS 18.2 update.\n\nIn 2025, Apple will roll out support for more languages, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), Italian, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. The support for the first set of new languages will arrive in April 2025 (probably via iOS 18.4), and more languages will continue to arrive at a later date.\n\nWith these features, Apple Intelligence will feel complete and offer a more connected experience across the Apple ecosystem. To sum up, 2024 was a landmark year for Apple, marking the advent of its AI initiatives, and 2025 is set to be even more significant, as it would mark the completion of Apple Intelligence."

After all, the ghostly multiplayer game has been out for over four years. That\u2019s a considerable amount of time to familiarize yourself with all the spookiness. Kinetic Games seems aware of that, because changes are coming to every single contract.\n\nIn a landscape full of co-op games, Phasmophobia manages to get the balance just right between slightly absurd comedy and genuine scares. You and a group of intrepid paranormal investigators look into some spectral happening, with the goal being to chart whatever the paranormal entity actually is before it gets angry and aggressive and traps you all.\n\nIt\u2019s often harder than it sounds, but in the right group it\u2019s a good laugh. As part of an overhaul for 2025, the horror game is getting a substantial rework. Areas are getting changed, new tools are being added, and the general structure of a round is being tweaked.\n\nStarting on the latter, rather than grading findings on quality now, the multiplayer game offers rewards for \u2018unique\u2019 captures on different devices. Essentially, the first person of the group to get a reading of something in a particular media form will get a specific bonus for doing so, encouraging everyone to use their entire inventory.\n\nTo complement this, a tape recorder is now part of your arsenal, for auditory field recordings. Anything you pick up can be played back afterward, and it\u2019s suggested that the longer you stick around the weirder those sounds will get \u2013 jinkies!\n\nTiny peeks are given of the Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, both of which will look different in due time. Several rooms in the former are being done up, encouraging fresh visits to admire the d\u00e9cor and see what fresh poltergeists are floating around.\n\nThese updates are coming throughout 2025, according to the developer\u2019s post \u2013 something to look forward to or anxiously await, depending on your temperament. Have a look at our lists of the best zombie games and the best ghost games if you\u2019re a scarehound who wants to really jump out of your skin.\n\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know."

The footage, captured by a passenger from a commercial flight, shows multiple human-like figures standing on top of clouds. While the location and timing of the video remain unclear, it has caught the attention of many after the clip shared by Myra Moore, a self claimed paranormal expert. In her post, Moore was herself fascinated with the strange sight and asked others to share their opinion on the unusual scene above the Earth. The video has led to various conspiracy theories, as some humorously suggested the figures are just people on a snowy landscape, while others speculate it could be steam from industrial gases rising through a fog.\n\nTaking to X(Formerly Twitter), the paranormal expert asked, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline.

The metallic hunk measuring 2.5 metres in diameter and weighing about 500 kg landed in the Mukuku village of Makueni country on December 30 and has been confirmed as a space object.\n\nIn an official statement, the Kenya Space Agency said citing preliminary assessments that the debris is a separation ring of a rocket. These rings are used to connect two stages of a launch vehicle which separate at specific altitudes.\n\nFollowing the discovery of a metallic fragment of a space object in Mukuku Village, Makueni County, the Kenya Space Agency has issued the following statement. Read more for details on the incident, preliminary findings, and next steps. pic.twitter.com/n8gsvoKku4 \u2014 Kenya Space Agency (@SpaceAgencyKE) January 1, 2025\n\n\"Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans. This is an isolated case, which the Agency will investigate and address using the established framework under the international space law,\" the agency stated.\n\nSeveral pictures claiming to be from Kenya of the separation ring have surfaced on social media. Notably, the origin of the space junk has not been determined yet.\n\nThat \"space debris\" that fell in Makueni is worth $ M in research ( weight, heat resistance). But, our KE Space Agency and Police (really?)\ud83e\udd23 already declared it a \"500kg metal\". Every Lab wants such a small object that re-enters earth from space \"ballistically\" without burning pic.twitter.com/2l7v7mleWL \u2014 Philosopher (@Philosopher254) January 1, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, the Kenyan space agency assured the public that the debris \"poses no immediate threat to safety.\"\n\n\"Our experts will analyze the object, use existing frameworks to identify the owner and keep the public informed or the next steps and outcomes,\" it further said.\n\nThe fall was reportedly occurred on the same day as the crash of a satellite in Ghana, according to an X user. When asked if there's a connection between the two, the space agency said it is \"highly unlikely.\"\n\nALSO SEE: NASA Sued By Florida Family After Space Junk Strikes Their House\n\nALSO SEE: Massive Space Junk Of Suspected SpaceX Capsule Crashes In US, Discoverers Baffled\n\n(Image: X)"

            "source": "BGR",
            "article_content": "OpenAI held a massive ChatGPT-centric event before Christmas, making several key announcements for ChatGPT and other genAI tools it currently offers. The reasoning ChatGPT model o1 and the text-to-video Sora service got public releases. OpenAI also demoed the o3 model coming later this year, released Canvas, and even made ChatGPT available via WhatsApp texting.\n\nWhat OpenAI failed to do is keep a privacy promise made earlier this year. The company announced a Media Manager feature back in May. The tool is meant to allow creators of all sorts of content to opt out of ChatGPT and other genAI models training.\n\nOpenAI said Media Manager will be available by 2025, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Not only that, but the company might not be actively working on the feature, and there\u2019s no telling when it will come out.\n\nTraining models like ChatGPT require lots of data so the AI can learn to predict what the user needs. OpenAI uses all sorts of data from the internet to train its AI, including copyright content from creators it didn\u2019t obtain access to. Several creators sued the company after finding their works were used to train the AI.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMedia Manager should be a tool that lets creators opt out of training for all sorts of media content, not just written text. OpenAI described Media Manager as a cutting-edge tool to protect user privacy:\n\nThis will require cutting-edge machine learning research to build a first-ever tool of its kind to help us identify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video across multiple sources and reflect creator preferences.\n\nWhile that sounded great on paper, we have all forgotten about it. OpenAI has not mentioned Media Manager since May, and development for the privacy tool might not have advanced. Says TechCrunch, which talked to people familiar with the project.\n\nThe blog has learned that Media Manager was rarely viewed as an important project internally. A former OpenAI employee told TechCrunch that Media Manager wasn\u2019t a priority. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it,\u201d they said.\n\nAlso, a person who doesn\u2019t work at OpenAI but coordinates work with the AI firm said they discussed the tool with the company but haven\u2019t received any updates.\n\nTechCrunch also notes that an OpenAI legal team member involved with Media Manager transitioned to a part-time consultant role.\n\nNone of this comes directly from OpenAI. Insiders who shared information might not have access to the bigger picture. But even if TechCrunch\u2019s information isn\u2019t accurate, there\u2019s still the fact that OpenAI has been quiet on the Media Manager feature for half a year.\n\nIf it were finished, the privacy tool could have easily been a \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement. At the very least, OpenAI could have updated the timeline.\n\nA more cynical view is that OpenAI is biding its time. Recent reports said that training next-gen ChatGPT versions isn\u2019t working as planned. OpenAI saw delays for GPT-5, and access to better-quality training data might be one factor impacting development. Copyrighted content that makes it into AI training data could be better quality than other types of content. I\u2019m just speculating here.\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that a Media Manager tool might be released eventually, maybe once the copyright lawsuits against OpenAI are concluded and the company knows exactly what it can and can\u2019t do when training new AI models. Who knows if Media Manager might be needed once that happens. Also, ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 upgrade might get out of development and closer to release by then.\n\nFinally, even if Media Manager were available, it would still require some work from creators to flag out copyrighted content that should not train the AI. Despite that, copyright content might be found in all sorts of places on the internet that creators would not flag. OpenAI would crawl those places and the content might still make it into training data sets.\n\nMedia Manager delays aside; regular ChatGPT users have privacy settings at their disposal to opt out of having the data in their prompts train the AI."

Much of the work needed to get the most out of these off-the-shelf tools requires prompt engineering, or crafting the prompts used to structure responses.\n\nHowever, there are limits to prompt engineering. You need to deliver the same prompt every time, along with user requests and all their associated data. This can be a significant issue if you\u2019re pushing the maximum size of a model\u2019s context window, and it can cost you more each time, as services like Azure OpenAI are paid for on a per-token basis. At the same time, complex requests can add latency to operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is a way to focus the underlying model and tune it to work with your data. This is where Azure AI Foundry comes in. Azure AI Foundry offers a framework that helps you fine-tune big, complex models with Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). By using this technique to adjust model parameters, when you run AI inference workloads, higher quality results can be delivered using fewer tokens, with less risk of prompt overruns and other issues that can cause incorrect or incoherent results."

            "article_content": "There is very little movement in markets over the Christmas period, so this week we are looking at selling and what might affect markets in the new year.\n\nThis time of the year is quieter on tillage farms.\n\nYes, there is still work to be done, but there is time to catch up on crop records, costs and returns.\n\nKnowing the costs and returns of all your crops is essential.\n\nIn order to decide on what price to sell your grain at, you need to know your costs, so get this job done as soon as possible and decide on a price that you are happy to sell at to spread risk.\n\nThis was brought up numerous times at Tillage Day 2024 and it was clear it is a job that more farmers need to do.\n\nHaving those figures to hand and deciding on a number to sell at makes the decision easier to make once you get a text message with prices from your co-op or merchant.\n\nForward selling\n\nIn recent years, harvest prices have worked out very well for people, but that doesn\u2019t say it will happen every year.\n\nThat said, you are probably better off to either take the harvest price every year or do some forward selling every year, rather than dipping in and out of both of them, or else you may lose out badly in certain years.\n\nIf you are forward selling grain, then you should only be selling about 50% on your estimated production. You should be a little bit pessimistic with yield predictions as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you have sold grain, but don\u2019t have that grain. At Tillage Day, Donal Moloney of Tirl\u00e1n explained that farmers can sell as little as 20t at a time when forward selling grain.\n\nIf you think about that, you could be selling small amounts of grain every week or every two weeks or even once a month to get an average price from the season.\n\nThis would be spreading risk - something similar to the Boortmalt pricing system where an average price is taken every week from the middle of April to the middle of September.\n\n2025 prices\n\nLooking ahead to prices and it is very hard to know where they will end up this season. There was a lift in prices in December.\n\nTeagasc economist Fiona Thorne estimated that prices could rise by 5% in 2025 at their recent Outlook Conference.\n\nThis prediction was based on the difference between historic predicted values of French wheat prices and the actual outcomes.\n\nTeagasc estimated an increase in EU cereal production and an increase in Irish cereal yields. Looking at costs and Teagasc placed fertiliser prices down 5%, but fertiliser use up on a whole-farm basis."

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "The new trackways connect to discoveries made in the area in 1997, where previous limestone quarrying revealed more than 40 sets of footprints, with some trackways reaching up to 180 m in length. At the time, the site provided major new information on the types of dinosaurs present in the UK during the Middle Jurassic Period. The site was recognised as one of the most scientifically important dinosaur track sites in the world and subsequently designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. However, the original site is largely no longer accessible and, since the findings predated the use of digital cameras and drones, there is limited photographic evidence.\n\nThe new trackways add to the significance of the area, and even though the discoveries are separated by just thirty years, modern techniques and technology mean the prints can be recorded much more comprehensively than ever before.\n\nProfessor Richard Butler, Professor of Palaeobiology at the University of Birmingham, said: \u201cThere is much more that we can learn from this site, which is an important part of our national Earth heritage. Our 3D models will allow researchers to continue to study and make accessible this fascinating piece of our past for generations to come.\u201d\n\nDuring the new excavation, more than 20,000 images were created of the prints. These will provide a wealth of material for further study and education and could yield valuable insights into how these dinosaurs walked, including speeds, how large they were, and if and how they interacted.\n\nDr Duncan Murdock, Earth Scientist at OUMNH, said: \u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out. Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d\n\nDiscovery to be celebrated on BBC\u2019s Digging for Britain and in public exhibition\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Digging for Britain team filmed the work as part of a new series due to be broadcast next week. Presented by Professor Alice Roberts, who is also the University of Birmingham\u2019s Professor of Public Engagement in Science, the programme will be available on iPlayer from 7th January, and broadcast on BBC Two on 8th January 2025.\n\nThe dig will also feature in the exhibition Breaking Ground at OUMNH, which tells the story of major developments in our understanding of the history of life and Earth. Visitors will be able to view the Megalosaurus fossils used in the first description of a dinosaur, see photographs and video footage from the dig site, and learn about the latest techniques used by palaeontologists to study dinosaurs.\n\nThe excavation was funded by the Geologists\u2019 Association, School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham, and the University of Birmingham Alumni Fund."

From brainstorming and branding to building and selling, this guide breaks down the process step by step, offering a roadmap to help you create your own no-code business.\n\nCreating an AI Business\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Identified a clear problem: Job seekers struggle with resume customization, addressed by an AI-powered resume optimization tool with a freemium model.\n\nBuilt a strong brand (\u201cGet Get Job\u201d) with professional branding elements and a user-focused landing page to attract and convert users.\n\nDeveloped the product using no-code platforms like Bolt, Supabase, and Make.com, allowing rapid creation without coding expertise.\n\nAcquired customers through LinkedIn outreach, using tools like Outbond and Smartlead, and offered discounted plans to attract early adopters.\n\nAchieved profitability within 72 hours, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, showcasing the feasibility of launching a no-code AI business quickly.\n\n1: Identify the Problem and Validate Your Idea\n\nThe foundation of any successful business lies in solving a real-world problem. In this case, the challenge was clear: job seekers often struggle to tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions. This process is not only time-consuming but also tedious, leaving many job seekers frustrated. The solution? An AI-powered resume optimization tool that simplifies and streamlines this task.\n\nThe target audience was identified as active job seekers, particularly those using platforms like LinkedIn. These individuals could benefit significantly from a tool that automates resume customization. To validate the idea, a freemium business model was chosen. This model offered basic features for free while charging $29 per month (or discounted annual plans) for premium features. This pricing strategy ensured accessibility while providing a clear path to revenue generation.\n\n2: Build a Strong Brand\n\nA strong and cohesive brand identity is critical for building trust and attracting users, especially in the early stages of a business. The business was named \u201cGet Get Job,\u201d a memorable and relevant name that resonated with the target audience. Branding elements such as a professional logo, a consistent color palette, and a user-friendly landing page were created using tools like Namecheap, Luca, and Coolors.\n\nThe landing page played a pivotal role as the primary point of interaction with potential users. It clearly outlined the product\u2019s features, benefits, and pricing structure, making it easier to convert visitors into users. A well-designed landing page is not just a marketing tool; it is the cornerstone of any successful online business, as it establishes credibility and communicates value effectively.\n\nBuild a Profitable AI Business in 72 Hours (No-Coding)\n\nEnhance your knowledge on AI business optimization by exploring a selection of articles and guides on the subject.\n\n3: Develop the Product Without Coding\n\nThanks to advancements in no-code platforms, creating a functional product without writing a single line of code is now possible. For this project, the app was built using Bolt, a no-code app builder, while automation workflows were implemented through Make.com. Supabase was used to handle backend tasks such as user authentication and data storage.\n\nThe core functionality of the product revolved around solving the identified problem. Users could upload their resumes, link job descriptions, and receive AI-generated, optimized resumes tailored to specific roles. This feature directly addressed the pain point of resume customization, offering a practical and valuable solution for job seekers. By using no-code tools, the development process was not only faster but also more cost-effective, allowing the focus to remain on delivering a high-quality user experience.\n\n4: Acquire Customers\n\nWith the product ready, the next step was to attract users. LinkedIn emerged as the ideal platform for outreach due to its large base of job seekers. Tools like Outbond and Smartlead were used for lead generation, contact enrichment, and email automation. These tools enabled personalized communication at scale, making it easier to connect with potential users.\n\nTo incentivize early adopters, discounted annual plans were offered. This strategy not only encouraged sign-ups but also provided valuable feedback for refining the product. Early customer acquisition often involves unscalable, hands-on efforts, such as personalized outreach and direct engagement. While these methods can be time-intensive, they are crucial for validating the business model and building an initial user base.\n\n5: Overcome Challenges\n\nLaunching a business in such a short timeframe is not without its challenges. Technical issues, such as database integration and automation workflow errors, required troubleshooting and persistence. These obstacles underscored the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills in the startup process.\n\nOperational challenges also arose, including managing outreach campaigns and responding to user inquiries. These tasks demanded significant time and effort but were essential for securing initial customers and establishing a foundation for growth. Overcoming these hurdles required a combination of strategic planning, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from setbacks.\n\n6: Measure Results\n\nDespite the challenges, the project achieved profitability within the 72-hour timeframe. Two sales were made, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, resulting in a profit of $238. This outcome demonstrated the feasibility of launching a profitable no-code AI business quickly and efficiently. By focusing on a specific problem and using the right tools, it is possible to achieve tangible results in a short period.\n\nTools and Platforms That Made It Possible\n\nThe success of this project was made possible by a variety of tools and platforms, each playing a crucial role in different aspects of the business:\n\nAI and Automation: Make.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.\n\nMake.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Bloatware: brazen or sneaky? A long trail of connectivity woes Gee, Motorola, fix the Moto G! Look no further than home, Motorola\n\nA few months ago, I had an opportunity to try a handful of Motorola smartphones. They look good and even stand out, though the brand seems to be pulling off lazy-Samsung-design stuff with some of its releases. But then, Samsung is doing worse, so there\u2019s that bittersweet consolation.\n\nAn argument can be made here that Motorola is putting some great phones on the shelf with a premium feel and competitive innards at attractive prices. But it is undeniable that Motorola is not in the best state, at least from the perspective of users who have recently plonked cash to get a Moto smartphone.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhat follows is an account of pitfalls sourced straight from Motorola loyalists, showcasing the brand\u2019s ongoing struggles. But more importantly, these could be stepping stones to redemption as Motorola heads into the 2025 calendar year.\n\nBloatware: brazen or sneaky?\n\nLast year, Digital Trends\u2019 Mobile Section Editor Joe Maring highlighted his tryst with Motorola phones throughout the year and what the brand needs to fix as 2025 arrives.\n\nOne of the core niggles in the article was the amount of bloatware. Android\u2019s bond with unnecessary and downright shady software isn\u2019t a fresh story. Some brands, after widespread criticism, have even fixed the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, Motorola appears to have taken the opposite route and in quite an ironic fashion. The first aspect that comes to mind when buying a Motorola phone is the near-stock, Pixel-like Android UX. Well, that only appears to be the surface story.\n\nUnderneath, there\u2019s something peculiar going on. There are a whole bunch of reports floating around on Reddit, X, and product forums where users reported automatic installation of bloatware. MotoApps pops up as the repeat offender in user rants.\n\nA recurring theme is software updates, which apparently download unnecessary ad-ridden apps without user consent or even declaring it first-hand. The whole installation pipeline is executed in the background.\n\nA few solutions are making rounds of the user community, such as deactivating the MotoApps, disabling Moto Services, and buying phones unlocked instead of a carrier store. Neither is an ideal situation.\n\nWhy burden users in the first place?\n\nWhy would \u201coptimization updates\u201d need to install apps such as poorly designed puzzle games without consent? It\u2019s like your calculator app sneakily granted it location privileges, even though it doesn\u2019t need any such system access to operate in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not the end of it. The woes extend all the way to the lock screen experience, where a rather nasty ad-adjacent app called Taboola is pestering users for \u201cinterests\u201d so that it can show them ads on the lock screen.\n\nFor an average person, it\u2019s impossible to get rid of since that requires them to run an ADB command. It seems the phone reads it as a system app, meaning even if you disable the activity, it automatically re-enables its functionality.\n\n\u201cFurther attempts to de-bloat the device resulted in further soft-bricking. I will try to install custom ROMs to detach completely from the Motorola software ecosystem,\u201d wrote one miffed user in a thread brimming with similar stories.\n\nOf course, Motorola phone users are not happy about it. Detailed ADB tutorials are also floating around to help users who aren\u2019t fans of the intrusive lock screen adware activity. It\u2019s no easy route; some have even walked the path at the cost of bricking their phone.\n\nA long trail of connectivity woes\n\nWe buy phones to do, well, phone things, like making calls and texting. It would render all the cellular innovations (and the inflated bill) redundant if the phone cannot latch on to its intended network lanes.\n\nYet, that\u2019s precisely the problem Motorola smartphone users have been reporting for a while now. We found identical complaints dating back at least four years. Curiously, the woes haven\u2019t received any media attention, but a quick look at social media and user forums unearths a ton of 5G connectivity-related complaints.\n\nDigital Trends talked to at least three Motorola smartphone users who have faced issues with 5G connectivity on their phones and confirmed that it remains unsolved despite receiving multiple major and minor software updates.\n\nWe tried to discuss the issue with customer support personnel at authorized Motorola service outlets in India\u2019s national capital. However, they declined to comment on the technical shortcomings that might be at play here.\n\nFurther, it seems that the 5G connectivity woes are not limited to one particular region. Motorola smartphone users have reported cellular issues in multiple countries, including North America.\n\n\u201cI got my Edge 50 fusion about a week now and I\u2019ve noticed it loses its carrier signal completely at random moments. If I wait about 10-30 seconds it comes back up on its own,\u201d says one such complaint.\n\n27% left I need to plug in my 5G @Moto that doesn't get 5G only 4G+\n\nI don't recommend anyone buying a Motorola in UK anymore\u2026this is a serious issue with the phones\u2026 Not a Network issue pic.twitter.com/Y48oYBo6JJ \u2014 Anthony's Stormy World \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0e (@AnthonyStorms7) April 26, 2024\n\nSo far, we haven\u2019t encountered any concrete solution, nor has Motorola officially acknowledged it, let alone provide a fix. Some users speculate that the problem raised its head after a particular software update, which did something odd with the network configuration setup. Still, others claim it to be a hardware flaw.\n\nWe are unsure if Motorola made any cost cuts and went with inferior quality antenna hardware or if it was just another case of bad network reception that has given similar infamy to the Google Pixel phones.\n\nMotorola employees have been fairly active in the r/Motorola subreddit in posts discussing the connectivity woes and suggesting network resets as one of the solutions. Unfortunately, that suggestion doesn\u2019t appear to be a magic potion.\n\nNetwork keeps on connecting and disconnecting on my motorola edge 30 while on 5G. The issue never existed before on the device. Don't know what is the reason\u2026. This drains the battery quicker too\u2026anyone facing the same issue? @motorolaindia @Moto_Support @Moto @TechWiser pic.twitter.com/AvWPiKYIN4 \u2014 Sujay Kumar (@IamSujayKumar) January 1, 2024\n\nRebooting the phone, resetting the network profile, or switching back and forth between airplane mode hasn\u2019t offered any respite to the affected users. A few have had luck with force-resetting NR network mode, but that, too, is dependent on network coverage and carrier-related technicalities.\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to do quantum computing to understand the gravity of this fundamental problem. Users have resorted to switching down their network preference to 3G mode to get a reliable network, but that also only offers temporary respite.\n\n\u201cMan I am frustrated by this 4G/5G signal bars with exclamation mark..is it compulsory that I need to shut down all my work and wait until this symbol goes out\u2026it completely disconnects from internet and make sure I suffer,\u201d wrote one such Motorola phone user.\n\nHowever, it appears that carriers are aware of the connectivity hassles on Motorola phones. \u201cI was told by Verizon that this phone is known for having a bad antenna,\u201d claims one Motorola phone user in a thread describing similar issues on U.S. and Canadian networks.\n\nGee, Motorola, fix the Moto G!\n\nThe Moto G series was quite literally a champion of Android. When the first Moto G phone launched in 2013, it was a smash hit. Of course, a price tag within the $200 margin was a key factor, but the phone was a total package.\n\nA beautifully understated design, a sharp HD display, a Qualcomm processor, and vanilla Android were recipes for success in 2013. When Motorola brought it to India, it quickly became a hot favorite, similar to the situation in other emerging markets.\n\n\u201cMotorola makes a strong comeback in India in its unique way.\u201d \u201cHow Motorola became a smash hit in India.\u201d \u201cMotorola needs India to keep its momentum rolling.\u201d These were just some of the headlines that appeared at esteemed business and tech journalism outlets at the time.\n\nEver since, Motorola has dramatically diversified its portfolio while killing the flagship X line in favor of the Edge series and reviving Razr as a foldable phone line. But in that spell, the Moto G series lost its charm, and in quite a dramatic fashion.\n\n\u201cMotorola is ruining cheap Android phones.\u201d This Digital Trends headline about the sorry state of Motorola\u2019s budget G-series phones says it all. The Moto G Power 5G 2024 landed an abysmal 5/10 review score, while the Moto G 5G 2024 could only muster 4/10 in its assessment.\n\nTake, for example, the Motorola G85, which is arguably the most exquisitely designed phone you can get for just about $250. You need to hold it in your hands to realize how astoundingly gorgeous the hardware is, especially for that price bracket.\n\nIt offers a curved screen with Gorilla Glass 5, a fantastic rear texture design, a 120Hz screen, a high-end Sony sensor, and a large battery with fast charging skills. Motorola has even fixed its terrible software update policy in late 2024.\n\nLook no further than home, Motorola\n\nMotorola needs to stick with this formula and iterate on it. In doing so, the brand could also use some trimming and pruning in the lower-priced segment, where its phones simply aren\u2019t competitive against fellow Chinese rivals.\n\nOf course, Chinese brands are not going to cede any ground willingly. However, Motorola still commands respect in the market and some of its Moto G-series phones are capable enough to carve a solid niche for themselves.\n\nBut before that happens, Motorola also needs to grapple with the rising tide of display green line complaints, camera woes, performance inconsistencies, and, of course, cellular connectivity issues.\n\nMotorola certainly has enough experience, engineering prowess, and Lenovo money to pull all that off. The intent is definitely there. All it needs to do is hear the feedback of users and accordingly chart its course for the year ahead."

            "article_content": "The federal landscape is constantly shifting due to technological breakthroughs, modernization needs, leadership change-overs and emerging priorities. This is never more true than at the beginning of a new presidential administration, and 2025 is sure to be a transformational and pivotal year in determining how the remainder of this decade and beyond will take shape on an organizational level.\n\nMeriTalk recently interviewed Federal CIOs to understand their top tech priorities for 2025. They found that cybersecurity, workforce transformation, and AI rank as the top technology priorities in the Federal government, but that funding and skills gaps are hindering progress in these areas.\n\nGovCon Wire spoke with Ben Baldi, senior vice president of global public sector at automated software testing company Tricentis, to get his unique perspective on how the federal government is evolving and how the industrial base can accommodate the transformations. He touched on the ins and outs of data management, differences one might see in procurement processes and much more.\n\nGovCon Wire: Despite ongoing efforts to close the skills gap, year over year, workforce transformation remains a challenge for the federal government. What needs to change, and where do you think agencies can make progress in this area in 2025?\n\nBen Baldi: Workforce transformation has been a perennial challenge for the federal government, and I don\u2019t see that changing in 2025. What I do see, though, are opportunities for progress if agencies take a more focused and strategic approach.\n\nFirst, automation will be key. By adopting test automation, agencies can free up IT personnel from repetitive, time-consuming tasks and allow them to focus on higher-value priorities like cybersecurity and innovation. Additionally, leveraging low-code and no-code tools can democratize technology adoption across the workforce, enabling non-technical employees to contribute to digital transformation efforts. These are smart ways to stretch tight budgets while optimizing skilled resources, accelerating modernization and reducing operational bottlenecks.\n\nSecond, we need to rethink training. The federal workforce operates in an increasingly complex environment, so employees must be prepared to wear multiple hats. Agencies should offer cross-disciplinary training in areas like cybersecurity, quality assurance, data analytics and cloud computing. Partnering with private sector organizations and building strong mentorship programs can also help employees stay agile and ready for emerging challenges.\n\nFinally, agencies must double down on creating a purpose-driven culture. People stay when they feel their work matters, whether it\u2019s advancing national security, improving public health, or driving innovation that will impact society at large. Leaders can inspire commitment by celebrating successes, showing the real-world effects of their teams\u2019 work and involving employees in meaningful decision-making.\n\nIn 2025, agencies that integrate these strategies\u2014automation, training and mission-driven culture\u2014will be better positioned to close the skills gap and build a workforce that\u2019s ready to tackle future challenges.\n\nGCW: From the same survey, federal CIOs reported that improving data readiness was one of their top AI goals for 2025. What steps do agencies need to take in 2025 to improve data readiness?\n\nBaldi: In 2025, I predict we\u2019ll see data readiness take center stage as agencies ramp up their AI and generative AI initiatives. The message is clear: without high-quality, well-structured data, even the most sophisticated AI tools will fall short. That\u2019s why improving data readiness is becoming a top priority for federal CIOs\u2014and rightly so.\n\nData readiness means having data that\u2019s clean, structured and ready to be used for analysis and decision-making. But you can\u2019t have true data readiness without data integrity\u2014that is, ensuring the data is accurate, consistent and reliable from start to finish. The two go hand in hand, and both are essential for successful AI programs.\n\nIn 2025, agencies will need to adopt smarter, more proactive approaches to improve both. I expect to see a big push for automation to handle routine data checks, like identifying errors, inconsistencies, or missing values before they cause bigger problems. Agencies will also likely lean on real-time dashboards and alerts to monitor data quality and address issues like data drift as soon as they arise.\n\nAnother prediction? Strategic checkpoints will become standard practice. As data flows through increasingly complex systems\u2014think hybrid environments, multi-cloud setups, and diverse applications\u2014agencies will need built-in safeguards to detect changes in data structures to prevent biases from creeping in.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing new use cases emerge for data integrity, from validating data during migrations to ensuring operational accuracy in enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems and meeting compliance demands. These are areas where agencies can make immediate progress while preparing for the bigger AI picture.\n\nUltimately, 2025 will be about laying the groundwork. Agencies that prioritize data readiness and integrity now will position themselves to unlock AI and generative AI\u2019s full potential\u2014driving efficiency, innovation, and better services for citizens.\n\nGCW: How have you seen government IT procurement evolve over the last year, and what changes do you envision in 2025?\n\nBaldi: Another key trend we\u2019re observing is the growing prioritization of automated software testing in government procurement. Requests for proposals are increasingly mandating software testing\u2014especially automated testing\u2014as a standard requirement. This shift highlights a recognition among agencies of the critical role continuous testing plays in minimizing operational risks and achieving mission objectives. Additionally, we\u2019re seeing an emphasis on embedding security testing early in the software development lifecycle, reflecting broader DevSecOps trends and enabling public sector IT teams to deliver secure applications more efficiently.\n\nAt the same time, agencies are navigating heightened complexity within their technology ecosystems. From on-premises setups to multi-cloud and hybrid environments, and across microservices and enterprise applications like Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Oracle, and Workday, agencies must ensure seamless and consistent testing across diverse systems and platforms. Automated software testing allows agencies to do just that.\n\nGCW: What other emerging trends or challenges do you foresee shaping government agencies\u2019 strategies in 2025, particularly in anticipation of a new administration?\n\nBaldi: In 2025, many are expecting government agencies will face significant pressure to adapt to shifting priorities under the Department of Government Efficiency . This initiative will emphasize leaner, more independent teams, pushing agencies to streamline operations and embrace automation to replace outdated manual processes. Agencies will need to accelerate modernization efforts, as efficiency and speed will be paramount to meeting tighter fiscal demands. Those that fail to adopt scalable and automated solutions risk falling behind, particularly as federal and state budgets increasingly prioritize innovation and agility. Software testing, particularly automated testing, will be a cornerstone of these efforts, enabling agencies to modernize faster and with greater efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, I expect unspent infrastructure funds and shifting budget allocations will create urgency for agencies to act strategically. Departments like the Department of Homeland Security are expected to receive substantial funding increases, presenting opportunities for targeted modernization efforts. However, as the 2026 budget cycle looms, agencies must prepare for unpredictable shifts in funding and priorities. Success will require a forward-looking approach\u2014balancing compliance with efficiency mandates while leveraging data-driven insights to address program demands and unlock growth opportunities in a competitive and evolving environment."

            "article_content": "Tech mogul Elon Musk intensified his legal battle with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in the days after Christmas. Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize last year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors last year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, referred to a Dec. 13 court filing in which the company said that it did not bar its investors from also backing competitors. Investors were told that they would not receive competitively sensitive information from OpenAI if they chose to also invest in rivals to the company, the filing said.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a December interview with the Free Press that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings."

            "source": "The Jerusalem Post Blogs",
            "article_content": "Digital art has emerged as a vibrant frontier where technology and creativity converge, offering novel ways to create, share, and experience art. The tools driving innovation in this field are deeply rooted in advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, blockchain, and immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). These tools empower artists to push traditional boundaries, redefining what art can achieve in a digital era.\n\nAI and Machine Learning: Automating Creativity\n\nArtificial intelligence is transforming digital art, offering tools that augment human creativity and open new avenues for exploration. Generative AI platforms like CGDream website allow users to generate high-quality images based on textual prompts. These tools not only save time but also enable creators to visualize complex ideas quickly.\n\nBeyond generative art, machine learning models like those offered by Runway ML allow artists to create personalized styles and adapt existing artworks with ease. These models learn from vast datasets, helping artists generate unique pieces while maintaining control over the final outcome. For animators and video creators, tools like Ebsynth use machine learning to convert static art into motion, bridging the gap between static and dynamic mediums.\n\nAI's impact is also evident in its ability to democratize art. Artists without formal training can now leverage AI tools to create sophisticated works, fostering inclusivity in the creative landscape.\n\nGenerative Art Platforms\n\nGenerative art, where algorithms and code are used to produce artworks, represents another leap in digital art innovation. Platforms like Processing and p5.js enable creators to generate intricate designs by writing simple code. These tools allow artists to explore procedural generation, which uses algorithms to create patterns, shapes, and visuals that would be difficult to achieve manually.\n\nTouchDesigner, a node-based visual programming tool, has gained prominence among digital artists for crafting interactive installations and performances. By blending real-time data with visual elements, artists can create dynamic pieces that react to audience interaction or environmental changes.\n\nGenerative art challenges traditional definitions of creativity and authorship, as the artist's role shifts from directly crafting pieces to designing systems that create art autonomously. This fusion of mathematics, technology, and aesthetics has redefined the creative process.\n\nBlockchain and NFTs: Revolutionizing Ownership\n\nThe advent of blockchain has revolutionized how digital art is bought, sold, and owned. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are at the forefront of this transformation, enabling digital artworks to be tokenized and sold with verifiable ownership. Marketplaces like OpenSea, Foundation, and Rarible provide artists with platforms to sell their creations directly to collectors, bypassing traditional galleries and middlemen.\n\nSmart contracts further enhance the blockchain art ecosystem by automating royalty payments. Artists can earn a percentage of the sale price every time their work is resold, ensuring continuous revenue streams. This feature is particularly significant in addressing the historical issue of artists losing financial benefits once their work enters the secondary market.\n\nHowever, blockchain's role in digital art isn't without controversy. The energy consumption of many blockchain networks has raised environmental concerns, prompting a push for more sustainable alternatives like Ethereum's recent shift to a proof-of-stake model. Despite these challenges, blockchain's potential to reshape art's economic landscape remains undeniable. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nImmersive Technologies: AR and VR\n\nImmersive technologies such as AR and VR are redefining how audiences experience art. AR tools like Adobe Aero allow artists to overlay their digital creations onto real-world environments, enabling interactive exhibitions that engage viewers in entirely new ways. AR's accessibility through smartphones and tablets makes it a versatile tool for public art installations and marketing campaigns.\n\nOn the other hand, VR platforms like Tilt Brush, Quill, and Gravity Sketch enable artists to create three-dimensional pieces in virtual spaces. These tools allow for an unprecedented level of immersion, letting artists \"step into\" their creations and sculpt or paint within a virtual environment.\n\nVR also facilitates collaborative creation, where multiple artists can work together in the same virtual space regardless of their physical location. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale projects and experimental art forms.\n\nOpen-Source Tools and Communities\n\nThe open-source movement plays a pivotal role in digital art innovation. Tools like Blender, a free and open-source 3D creation suite, provide professional-grade capabilities for modeling, animation, and rendering. Similarly, GIMP offers an alternative to commercial software like Photoshop, giving artists access to powerful image-editing tools without financial barriers.\n\nOpen-source platforms thrive on community contributions, where artists and developers collaborate to enhance functionality and share creative techniques. These communities foster innovation and ensure that cutting-edge tools remain accessible to artists at all levels.\n\nThis article was written in cooperation with CGDream"

Techniques like transfer learning and fine-tuning have allowed CNNs to be pre-trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned for specific tasks, improving performance and reducing the need for extensive labeled data. Attention mechanisms, such as those used in Transformer models, have further enhanced the performance of sequence models by allowing them to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. RNNs can process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous steps. LSTMs improve upon RNNs by addressing the vanishing gradient problem, enabling them to learn long-term dependencies. Multi-modal learning transfers knowledge between different modalities, such as text, speech, image, and video.\n\n\n\nThere are broader challenges that are faced by multi-modal machine learning, such as in representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. It is a multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential.

Israel has devastated Gaza after the October 2023 attack led by Hamas. Syria\u2019s civil war took a shocking turn with rebels ousting Bashar al-Assad. A brutal civil war has broken out in... Read More\n\nSyrian opposition fighters celebrate after the Syrian government collapsed in Damascus, Syria, on December 8, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nThe Ukraine-Russia war that began in February 2022 led to a series of conflicts for various reasons in different parts of the world, including Israel, Gaza, Syria, Sudan and Myanmar, taking a huge toll on not only the stakeholders, but the world at large.\n\nWill 2025 continue to witness the rage or will be there an end to this violence? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nrelated stories\n\nWhat Is The Status Of The Gaza War?\n\nGaza Strip, which is small territory along the Mediterranean Sea, became the hotbed of violence in October 2023 when Palestinian extremist group Hamas unleashed attacks on Israel, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities in the area.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said. Israel\u2019s military said it \u201celiminated\" Hamas fighters.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has warned that Hamas will \u201csuffer blows of a magnitude not seen in Gaza for a long time\" if it doesn\u2019t release the remaining hostages and stop firing at Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military has stated quite often that it only targets militants and has blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army said it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nSome 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been displaced, many of them multiple times, due to the war.\n\nThe US and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in November issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former defence chief Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe war has impacted Israeli citizens. More than 82,000 Israelis moved abroad in 2024 and 33,000 people immigrated to the country, Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics said. Another 23,000 Israelis returned after long periods abroad.\n\nBut there is a chance that the war could end this year. Donald Trump had told Netanyahu that he wanted the conflict to end before he returns to the White House on January 20. After he was declared a winner, Trump had said in his address that he wants all wars to end.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will keep hold of Gaza for the \u201cforeseeable future\" after the war ends. He also wants the Palestinian Authority to take a role in Gaza\u2019s administration.\n\nJosef Federman, Associated Press\u2019 news director (Israel-Palestinian territories-Jordan), said there are signs that the war is in its final stages. \u201cBut even if it ends, I don\u2019t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that\u2019s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think.\"\n\nIs Putin Ending The Ukraine Conflict?\n\nExperts predict that Russian President Vladimir Putin could up the ante against Ukraine as he would be set to reclaim the territories that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told the Mirror that Putin is unlikely to be satisfied with a peace deal imposed by the West and aim for further expansion, targeting post-1997 NATO states.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, Putin will advance his strategic plan to undermine and force post-1997 NATO states, including Poland, Finland, and the Baltic nations, to leave the alliance,\" Glees warns. He told the Mirror that this \u201cbig grab\" could cause a global war.\n\nWith Trump promises his electorate to end the Ukraine war within a day by negotiating a peace deal, reports suggest his plan may embolden Putin rather than deter him. Trump proposed deal includes freezing the current front lines, establishing a buffer zone, and delaying Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership by 20 years.\n\nAs per Kyiv Independent, Putin had said Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and disavowed its goal of joining the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin has also demanded that Ukraine acknowledge Crimea and Sevastopol as Russian territory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,\" Putin had said at the time.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, and since then, Moscow has made steady gains in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops have taken over 30 square kilometres of Kyiv\u2019s territory.\n\nUkraine had responded to Russia\u2019s offensive by using US long-range Army Tactical Missile System. Though experts insist that Kyiv being given permission to use these missiles is not a game changer, Moscow has responded by lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term was due to end in May 2024 has been extended due to martial law. He would need to be re-elected for Russia to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, Putin had said.\n\nSamya Kullab, Associated Press correspondent in Ukraine, told the Guardian that the situation is far different from when the war began. \u201cThe jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly,\" Kullab wrote.\n\nEuropean Union leaders believe Ukraine needs to hold on and maybe placate Trump to open ideas for negotiations with Russia. The EU will have to continue to sanction individuals and companies in Russia.\n\nWho Is In Charge In Syria After The Government Collapse?\n\nIn Syria, protests began against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, who came to power in 2000. Pro-democracy protesters during the peak of Arab Spring in 2011 took to the streets in Syria, calling for the ouster of the dictator. But the movement was crushed by Assad\u2019s forces, leading to the establishment of small militias and armed opposition groups from the Syrian military.\n\nAs anti-establishment forces grew, the Syrian allies stepped up support. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s proxy Hezbollah helped the armed rebel groups, while Russia bolstered the Syrian Air Force with warplanes. Soon, al-Qaeda started taking interest in the cause of Syria\u2019s opposition forces. By 2014, extremists, including ISIS swept the country.\n\nThe US then created the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 comprising Kurdish fighters \u2013 to eliminate ISIS without confronting the Syrian regime. The SDF fought against the ISIS and ended their territorial existence in Syria. In 2020, Russia and Turkey agreed to a ceasefire in the opposition-held region of Idlib.\n\nIn 2024, the war was triggered by a coalition of rebel forces calling themselves the Military Operations Command. They swept through the villages outside Aleppo\u2014the second largest city in Syria \u2013 and eventually seized Damascus \u2013 the capital city.\n\nAssad has vowed that Syria will continue \u201cto defend its stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their supporters\". The defence ministry said it was preparing to launch a counteroffensive. \u201cJoint Syrian-Russian warplanes\" have intensified precise strikes on rebel positions, killing and wounding dozens, it said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts have already expressed scepticism over Assad\u2019s chances. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank told CBS, \u201cAleppo seems to be lost for the regime. And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"\n\nThey cited the fact that Russia was heavily distracted by the war in Ukraine and that Iran and Hezbollah were left weakened by their conflict against Israel.\n\nThe experts said the rebels had been biding their time for years. \u201cThis has to do with geopolitics and local opportunity,\" Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told The Washington Post. \u201cThe rebellion at large had regrouped, rearmed and retrained for something like this.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden had called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\" but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\" and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\" but the US would assess their actions.\n\nExperts predict that West Asia could see massive changes in 2025. A US official told CNN that developments in Syria mark the collapse of \u201cIran\u2019s artifice\" across the region.\n\nWhatever happens in Syria will have a major impact on its neighbours Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, Iran lost its pillars in the Axis of Resistance. After the heavy blow that Hezbollah suffered at the hands of Israel, the fall of Assad is a fatal strike on Iran\u2019s influence efforts in the Middle East,\" Danny Citrinowicz, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East Programs, told Council for Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nWhat\u2019s The Status Of Civil War In Sudan?\n\nThe Sudanese civil war between two military factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in September 2024. It started as a power rivalry between the military heads of the SAF and the RSF, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hamdan Dagalo respectively. What began as a conflict in the capital city of Khartoum has spread to Omdurman, Bahri, Port Sudan, El Fasher and the Port Sudan cities, as well as the Darfur and Kordofan states.\n\nThe war is taking place as both warring parties are adamant about gaining ground and legitimising their power. The SAF, which came to power through a coup in 2021, claims to be the legitimate government, with the UN just about recognising them. However, the RSF has territorial gains around the capital and other war zones. It opposes the SAF\u2019s efforts to represent Sudan internationally, claiming legitimacy. The RSF, a former Arab militia known as Janjaweed, seeks alliances from several Arab countries to support its claim to power.\n\nSudan has been under the UN arms embargo, since the 2004 Darfur crisis, which has been now been extended for another year. However, the embargo has not blocked the flow of weapons. A Human Rights Watch report in July claimed that the warring parties have been using armed drones, anti-tank guided missiles, truck-mounted multi-barrel rocket launchers, and mortar munitions produced by companies registered in China, Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the UAE.\n\nAround nine rounds of peace talks led by the US and Saudi Arabia have been held, but all failed in the initial stage. The latest round of US-led peace talks was held in Geneva, Switzerland, on August 14, 2024. But, neither of the warring parties attended.\n\nAny new administration ruling Sudan would be a challenge to the internationally recognised and army-led national government which was forced out of Khartoum last year and now operates on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. A group of civilian politicians and armed group leaders have agreed to set up a \u201cpeace government\", RSF members told Reuters.\n\nThey said it would be civilian-led, independent of the RSF and set up to replace the government in Port Sudan which they accused of prolonging the war.\n\nThe civil has impacted several regions, with more than 2 million people seeking shelter in neighbouring Chad, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The refugee camps are overflown and have raised concerns in Europe that many will attempt to reach the continent. In February, dozens of Sudanese drowned when a migrant boat capsized along the Tunisia-Italy route. A lack of law and order has triggered ethnic clashes along the South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea borders. More than 100 deaths were reported in ethnic violence in the Abiey region, a disputed land between Sudan and South Sudan, according to the UN.\n\nThere is a fear that the military rivals would divide Sudan, leading to a similar situation in Libya. Unlike Ukraine and Gaza, the Sudanese war has not gained international traction, but the repercussions have been the same \u2014 fatalities, fear and destroyed livelihood.\n\nWhere Does Myanmar Stand In 2025?\n\nThe ongoing civil war in Myanmar, since the military toppled the civilian government in 2021, has killed more than 50,000 people and displaced around 3 million.\n\nThe fighting between the junta and armed resistance groups in the first two years of the war led to a stalemate while 2024 saw the military on the back foot. With the active Ukraine and Middle East wars, violence in Myanmar conflict has been received global attention.\n\nIn February 2021, the Myanmar\u2019s military staged a coup to overthrow the civilian government\u2014on the same day the parliament is set to swear in the winners of the 2020 election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won by a landslide. As a result, international condemnation and pro-democracy protests swept across the country, with the junta responding with a brutal crackdown. Nearly 500 were killed in the first two months of the coup.\n\nIn May 2021, the National Unity Government (NUG), comprising ousted lawmakers, protesters and ethnic minorities, announced its armed wing \u2013 the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF). But in August, Min Aung Hlaing named himself the Prime Minister, and announced a potential extension to the state of emergency.\n\nIn 2022, resistance forces become more united, with many PDF units and ethnic armies forming partnerships to launch joint attacks against junta troops.\n\nIn October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of ethnic armies, launched \u2018Operation 1027\u2019, seizing control of key areas from the military, marking a key victory for the resistance and a turning point in the war.\n\nIn January 2024, China brokered ceasefire between junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the junta announced mandatory conscription for all men between 18 and 35 years old and all women between 18 and 27 in February. The embattled military proposed a peace agreement with the resistance in September, urging them to \u201csolve political problems politically,\" but it is widely snubbed by the NUG.\n\nRebels in December took control of the country\u2019s western border with Bangladesh after insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA) drove out the junta\u2019s Border Guard Police (PGP5) in northern Rakhine State. The 270 km border with Bangladesh is now governed by the rebels.\n\nThe AA will likely be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state in Myanmar, as per BBC.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours are tense. Thailand in December held talks to resolve the political crisis. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers and high-level representatives from Myanmar as well as Laos, China, India, Bangladesh and host Thailand. But experts think the approach is unlikely to fructify.\n\nDavid Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst working on conflict and human rights issues on Myanmar, told Deutsche Welle, \u201cUnless the Myanmar military is serious about peace, these talks will be extremely limited. You can\u2019t approach any diplomacy on Myanmar without a clear understanding that the military is the root cause of all the problems.\"\n\nFirst Published: January 02, 2025, 18:04 IST"

            "article_content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a guest post from Ang Troy, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nMost IT organizations have cloud services in place or have made conscious decisions regarding its adoption. Such decisions may include adopting the cloud quickly and wholly, to proceed methodically with cloud services or to delay for a period of time.\n\nIn any of these strategies, IT organizations face major obstacles building, deploying, consuming, managing, securing and integrating cloud services.\n\nThe adoption of cloud computing is multidimensional, and it must be run like a multiyear program, not a fixed-duration project. As a result, the complexity of cloud adoption requires at least one accountable architectural leader to guide the organization through the transformation. This is the task of a role that many IT organizations are now finding to be mandatory: the enterprise cloud architect.\n\nMany organizations can clearly point to their lead enterprise cloud architect, but others have yet to formally name this individual or have piled the cloud responsibilities onto an already overburdened enterprise architect. Organizations that are the most successful have formally assigned cloud architecture responsibilities to ensure that a single, accountable architect is in charge.\n\nWhat is an enterprise cloud architect?\n\nAn enterprise cloud architect is responsible for the cloud computing initiatives in an organization and for directing the architectural aspects of the cloud team across all aspects of IT and the business.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect should be the foundation of a cloud center of excellence, or what will become the CCOE \u2014 the enterprise architecture function that governs the organization\u2019s approach to the cloud.\n\nCommon alternative names for a CCOE include: the cloud business office, the cloud transformation office, the cloud brokerage team and the cloud enablement team.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is usually a senior individual contributor who serves as the leader of the CCOE \u2014 or, if there is no cloud EA function, then as the leader of cloud initiatives.\n\nOften, the role of the enterprise cloud architect is largely self-directed, and day-to-day responsibilities are usually fluid. The specific tasks vary, depending on the level of the organization\u2019s cloud maturity and the maturity of its CCOE.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are typically not \u201chands-on.\u201d They will make decisions, but hand off responsibility for their technical implementation to a cloud engineering function. Cloud technical architects may be hands-on, but they are associated with the cloud engineering function, not the CCOE.\n\nWhere cloud sits in the organization\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is the foundation of the CCOE, and may be the only member of this hub in some organizations.\n\nCompanies may not have a structured center of excellence in name, and may rely on the enterprise cloud architect to effectively assume the role of this center. This is a common and acceptable practice, though Gartner recommends building out the CCOE with additional members.\n\nRegardless of the organizational design, the enterprise cloud architect has six key relationships:\n\nAdvisory-level access to senior IT leaders, either directly or through the EA team Direct and collaborative access to senior EA teams Direct and collaborative access to domain architecture teams Collaborative access to technical architects and teams Collaborative access to central function architects and teams Collaborative access to business unit representatives to discern business needs for specific solutions\n\nSkill sets of enterprise cloud architects\n\nDue to the broad applicability of cloud computing in an organization, it\u2019s unlikely that any individual will possess all the skills that the enterprise cloud architect role demands. However, the enterprise cloud architect should possess as many of the desired skills as possible.\n\nWhere a specific skill is lacking, the enterprise cloud architect should be able to collaborate or engage the relevant, resident experts in the organization. For example, if the enterprise cloud architect does not have a skill or strength in IT service management (ITSM), that individual needs to build a strong relationship with an ITSM expert to drive objectives to completion.\n\nAt the core, enterprise cloud architects are enterprise architects. Therefore, they need to have the competencies of good enterprise architects in order to drive business outcomes, empower business partners and develop and build effective architecture disciplines\n\nCloud computing is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d; it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow.\u201d Adopting cloud services is similar to a complex IT program that has no clear end in sight. Guiding cloud adoption requires strong leadership, not just at an executive level, but also at an architectural level.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are paramount to the eventual success of cloud adoption. Organizations should not delay placing the right individual into this crucial IT role."

            "article_content": "In an industry traditionally bound by desktop applications and monolithic file systems, Srinivasan Jayaraman has led a groundbreaking transformation in how Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) professionals collaborate and manage complex projects.\n\nIn an industry traditionally bound by desktop applications and monolithic file systems, Srinivasan Jayaraman has led a groundbreaking transformation in how Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) professionals collaborate and manage complex projects. As the lead architect of a revolutionary cloud-based system, Jayaraman has successfully bridged the gap between traditional desktop-centric workflows and modern cloud-native collaboration capabilities.\n\nThe challenge was formidable: transform an industry accustomed to working with massive single files for skyscraper designs and city planning into one that could leverage granular, object-based collaboration in real-time. This paradigm shift required not just technical innovation, but a fundamental rethinking of how AEC professionals interact with their design data.\n\nAt the helm of this transformation, Jayaraman spearheaded the architectural design and implementation of a sophisticated cloud-native system capable of handling unprecedented workload patterns. \"The unique challenge lay in managing spiky traffic patterns and intense client-server communications while maintaining system performance and reliability,\" explains Jayaraman.\n\nHis leadership role extended beyond technical architecture to guiding and mentoring a team of engineers and developers through the complete development lifecycle.The project's success hinged on meticulous planning and validation. Jayaraman's methodical approach began with creating a comprehensive prototype that would serve as the foundation for the final system. This prototype underwent rigorous testing to validate its ability to handle the distinctive workload patterns characteristic of AEC projects. The thorough validation process ensured that the system could maintain performance and reliability even under extreme conditions.\n\nThe impact of this innovation has been transformative. The system has revolutionized how AEC professionals access and collaborate on projects, freeing them from the constraints of desktop applications. This breakthrough has earned recognition from industry leaders, with AWS featuring the project as a case study, highlighting its exceptional scale and performance capabilities.Perhaps most significantly, the system has democratized access to design data within the AEC industry.\n\nProfessionals can now access their project information from anywhere, without requiring specialized design software. This capability has proven particularly valuable in an era where remote collaboration has become increasingly critical.The success of this project demonstrates how visionary technical leadership can drive industry-wide transformation. Under Jayaraman's guidance, the team not only solved complex technical challenges but also reshaped how an entire industry approaches collaboration and data management. The system stands as a testament to the power of cloud architecture in solving real-world industry challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, the implications of this innovation extend far beyond immediate operational improvements. The system has established a new standard for collaboration in the AEC industry, paving the way for future advancements in how complex architectural and engineering projects are managed and executed.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, the groundwork laid by Jayaraman and his team will serve as a foundation for the next generation of collaborative design tools.This achievement represents more than just a technical success; it marks a pivotal moment in the modernization of the AEC industry. Through careful architecture, innovative problem-solving, and strong leadership, Jayaraman has helped create a solution that not only meets today's challenges but also positions the industry for future growth and innovation.\n\nAbout Srinivasan Jayaraman\n\nA distinguished software architect with over 17 years of experience, Srinivasan Jayaraman has established himself as an innovative leader in designing and building highly scalable web services and systems. His deep expertise in cloud architecture, particularly with Amazon Web Services, has enabled him to pioneer transformative solutions for the AEC and manufacturing industries. His exceptional ability to architect complex systems using principles like Hexagonal Architecture and Command Query Responsibility Architecture has consistently delivered robust, scalable solutions that meet the highest standards of quality and performance."

It understands the social bonds that it has with the rest of its family members.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"[The mother] is bonded to [the calf] and she doesn't want to let it go. It is that simple.

            "article_content": "When many people hear the word \u201ccamp,\u201d images of summer excursions full of hiking, canoeing, craft making and new friends leap to mind. And, while Camp Susque certainly offers those things, the organization also functions as a beacon of community goodwill.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we struggle with is, there\u2019s that impression. Some people ask, \u2018what do you do the rest of the year?\u2019 We are a year round camp. There is always something going on at Susque,\u201d said Peter Swift, executive director for the camp for the past 10 years.\n\nSwift\u2019s family has a long history with the camp, dating back to 1947, when his grandfather, Bob Dittmar, founded the camp. In the 1990\u2019s, Swift\u2019s parents filled the very role he holds today, and his younger brother is the current operations director.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep and inviting love for the ministry, so my family just keeps coming back,\u201d Swift said.\n\nSome of the more traditional camp-oriented offerings Susque is known for include overnight residential and family summer camps, wilderness trips during the summer and short term \u201ctry it out\u201d camps for younger kids.\n\n\u201cWe like to be a resource to the community anytime there\u2019s any kind of crisis, especially locally in Trout Run, whether it\u2019s weather related, like the hurricane this summer, or whether it\u2019s an extended power outage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe camp was instrumental in helping area residents stay connected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, as schoolwork turned remote.\n\n\u201cWe are blessed with exceptionally good internet, so we set up antennas in our parking lot and offered drive-in WiFi, where students that needed to do remote work, or have a Zoom meeting, but didn\u2019t have the internet, could just come to our parking lot and do it there,\u201d Swift said.\n\nAdditionally, the camp opened its facilities to healthcare professionals and first responders that may need to self isolate.\n\nDuring the 2020-21 school year, as hybrid learning took hold, working with local school districts and county commissioners, the camp would rent out eight churches throughout the city, during the weekdays, when they are largely empty, and hire 80 staff, starting what they called \u201cschool learning sites,\u201d Swift explained.\n\n\u201cWe ended up serving more kids that fall than we would have through our summer camps,\u201d he said.\n\nThe initiative was a win-win for the camp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a Christian organization, and for us, that was an opportunity to do gospel ministry, to connect with these kids. We included Bible studies as an optional part of it. We gave kids the option to opt out. We didn\u2019t want to force our beliefs on anyone,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cOur mission is Biblical evangelism and growth of Christian character for youth, young adults and families, and finding a way to do that in the midst of the pandemic was really cool. And we put it together in two weeks,\u201d Swift said, proudly.\n\nMore recently, the camp was heavily involved in recovery efforts following the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene.\n\n\u201cThis summer, when there was the hurricane and Trout Run was flooding, we hosted families that were displaced and we provided laundry and shower facilities,\u201d Swift explained.\n\n\u201cWe have good backup generators and internet and things like that, so it\u2019s a good and safe place to come, if you, for some reason, can\u2019t be in your home,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the firehall not yet fully operational, the camp has taken on several of its normal services, including hosting Red Cross blood drives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been involved with disaster relief. The fire company knows that if there\u2019s a family that\u2019s displaced, they can come to Susque,\u201d Swift said.\n\nCamp Susque\u2019s reach extends far beyond the bounds of home, as they partnered with Heather Newhart, of Compassion Campers, and others to purchase and send 29 RVs to Tennessee and North Carolina to house families displaced by Helene\u2019s affects.\n\n\u201cA number of our staff have driven the RVs down there, and they\u2019re doing that on their own dime,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking time off from work. They\u2019re paying for gas. It\u2019s been a pretty amazing thing to see,\u201d he said.\n\nA big part of fulfilling the camp\u2019s mission and community outreach has been securing a way for each prospective camper to meet the sometimes hefty cost of enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe are about 1/5 of the national average when it comes to cost for residential camps, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re cheap,\u201d Swift said, explaining that the average cost per camper is around $600, while the national average is closer to $3,000.\n\n\u201cWe only collect around $350 to $400 after discounts, financial aid and scholarships, and that gap is primarily made up for by our community and our alumni making donations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe never want someone to avoid coming to camp because of the price. We do not turn people down for financial aid,\u201d Swift stressed.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody to have that opportunity. We want to encourage people, don\u2019t be daunted by the sticker price,\u201d he said.\n\nThose opportunities continue to grow as Swift and co. continue to pursue new ways to serve the community, as they wrap up a capital campaign for the construction of a new handicap accessible pool.\n\nA gap year program for recent high school graduates to take the time to decide their next path in life before entering college or the workforce is also under development by Camp Susque at two properties they acquired during the pandemic, Swift said.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, we\u2019ve primarily been providing either emergency housing or respite housing for families with domestic issues or pastoral retreats,\u201d he said.\n\nSwift credits the success of the camp to its staff as well as its alumni base.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our staff, both our year round staff and our summer staff. They\u2019re just the highest quality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd our alumni are incredible. I\u2019m always amazed by them. We\u2019ve been around for 77 years now, and I\u2019m really impressed by the Susque community and how generous they are with their time, their talents and their wallets,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that surprises a lot of people about Susque is that we don\u2019t have an endowment, we\u2019re not affiliated with a church. It\u2019s just the community and our alumni base that takes care of us,\u201d he explained.\n\nAdditionally, Swift gives great credit to the camp\u2019s continued dedication to the word of God.\n\n\u201cOur mission has remained consistent, and I think as long as we faithfully and doggedly pursue that mission, God provides for us through his people and we\u2019re very blessed to be able to kind of a front row seat for all of that,\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Northwestern University engineers made a remarkable advance in quantum computing and communication, demonstrating quantum teleportation over a standard fiber optic cable that already carries everyday Internet traffic.\n\nThis development shows that quantum communication might not require dedicated lines, which clears the path for easier and more widespread integration of quantum and classical data sharing.\n\nPath for quantum networking\n\nThe news centers around the idea that quantum signals \u2014 information carried by delicate particles of light known as photons \u2014 can travel alongside everyday Internet traffic without losing their integrity.\n\n\n\nThis breakthrough demonstrates quantum teleportation, a process where the state of a particle (like a photon) is transferred to another distant particle without the initial particle moving physically.\n\nScience behind quantum teleportation\n\nBy using entangled photons, this method enables secure, near-instantaneous data sharing and paves the way for future quantum networks.\n\nThe research team successfully tested a setup that allows quantum information to weave through the bustling flow of regular Internet data without interference.\n\nThis achievement overcomes one of the biggest hurdles in making quantum networks a practical reality.\n\nPrem Kumar, who oversaw the research, is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering.\n\nHe is known for his contributions to quantum communication and serves as the director of the Center for Photonic Communication and Computing.\n\n\n\nIn their recent work, Kumar and his collaborators introduce a new way of thinking about quantum signals alongside their classical counterparts.\n\nEntanglement in quantum communication\n\nQuantum teleportation stands out because it uses entanglement as a way to exchange information without physically sending matter across a distance. The concept traces back to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935.\n\n\n\nScientists have since tested quantum entanglement in labs, culminating in the formal proposal for quantum teleportation in 1993.\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of quantum teleportation is that it can occur almost as fast as light travels. Photons can become entangled so that performing a measurement on one instantaneously affects its partner, no matter how far away it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly exciting because nobody thought it was possible; our work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks sharing a unified fiberoptic infrastructure. Basically, it opens the door to pushing quantum communications to the next level,\u201d enthused Kumar.\n\nProtecting delicate photons\n\nSecuring a clear route for single photons involves more than just adding them to an active cable. Ordinary Internet traffic typically relies on millions of light particles, so a handful of quantum photons can easily get lost or overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nThe Northwestern team performed detailed studies on how light scatters inside the cable to see if there was a specific wavelength that experiences less clutter.\n\nThey pinpointed that sweet spot and added special filters to reduce the noise generated by normal data traffic.\n\n\u201cQuantum teleportation has the ability to provide quantum connectivity securely between geographically distant nodes,\u201d said Kumar.\n\n\n\nPast work suggested that large-scale quantum networks might need specialized systems. Now, his findings reveal that this might not be strictly necessary, if signals are positioned in just the right place in the spectrum.\n\nFirst test run in busy channels\n\nEarlier demonstrations of quantum teleportation typically involved pristine settings or dedicated fibers.\n\nSome researchers believed that real-world cables, teeming with signals, would smother the faint quantum light. That assumption has been proven wrong.\n\nIn tests at Northwestern, the researchers ran quantum signals and classical communications over the same fiber optic cable without them colliding.\n\nThey measured how well the quantum information arrived at its destination and confirmed that it was still correct at the other end.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks,\u201d Kumar summarized.\n\nReal-world infrastructure\n\nThe immediate plan is to scale the system to longer runs and then transition to underground fiber connections.\n\nThe group believes that an eventual shift to real-world cables could be next. Building on single-pair teleportation, they also want to experiment with multiple pairs of entangled photons to achieve another crucial step known as entanglement swapping.\n\nIf that milestone is reached, quantum networks could begin to take shape across regions rather than only between two points.\n\n\n\nFor critical operations in finance, defense, and data management, such networks could offer more secure connections thanks to the inherent secrecy of quantum methods, where any tampering is immediately noticeable.\n\nBroader applications\n\nThe capacity to support quantum connections without setting up special cables makes many new ideas more viable.\n\nDistributed quantum computing, which relies on linking multiple quantum computers in different locations, would be simpler to establish.\n\nDistance-sensing tasks and advanced metrology could also benefit from more stable quantum links.\n\nEven beyond computing, quantum networks have the potential to spur new technologies in encryption, imaging, and fundamental physics experiments.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also discussed using quantum entanglement to synchronize distant clocks or to share random numbers for cryptography at unprecedented levels of security.\n\nSignificance of quantum teleportation\n\nQuantum teleportation has matured from a fascinating theory to a tool that is becoming more practical.\n\nWhile it is never straightforward to integrate delicate quantum signals, the Northwestern group\u2019s accomplishment raises confidence that such integration is within reach.\n\nMany experts have believed that building specialized infrastructure was an unavoidable cost of quantum networking.\n\nAccording to Kumar\u2019s report, if wavelengths are picked carefully, classical signals and quantum information can coexist just fine. This line of thinking spares organizations from installing entire new grids of cables.\n\nFuture work on quantum teleportation\n\nIn upcoming work, the researchers plan to expand the scope of their approach in longer segments to confirm that the method remains stable as cables stretch far past the lab. They will also design a multi-node demonstration to verify it can handle more than a single link.\n\n\n\nThere is much excitement that existing communication channels, once tuned just right, could carry quantum data to distant points.\n\nWith such possibilities on the horizon, quantum teleportation may shift from a theoretical concept to a tool that transforms communication.\n\nThe future might see quantum and classical networks working side by side in ways that once sounded unlikely.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Optica.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

Duke distinguished professor of physics. \u201cWe will very much miss him.\u201d\n\nMehen, who was \u201ca highly regarded member of the faculty,\u201d first came to Duke in 2002 as an assistant professor and became a professor in 2016.\n\nHis research focused on quantum chromodynamics and the application of effective field theory to hadronic physics problems, working primarily with heavy quarks among other areas of nuclear physics. Mehen received several grants from the Department of Energy for his work and was presented with its Outstanding Junior Investigator Award in Nuclear Physics in 2005.\n\nMehen was born in Honduras and moved to Virginia with his family as a child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Virginia and a master\u2019s degree and doctorate from Johns Hopkins University, and he was a John A. McCone Postdoctoral Scholar at the California Institute of Technology and a University Postdoctoral Fellow at The Ohio State University.\n\nHe is remembered as an \u201cindependent thinker\u201d with an \u201cextraordinary ability to grasp complex concepts effortlessly.\u201d In recent years, Mehen served as \u201cone of the driving forces\u201d behind the TMD Handbook, which sought to make theoretical physics concepts more accessible to young researchers.\n\nMehen was known for his close connection to his students, and he had been named the lead faculty member for a new introductory physics sequence launched this fall.\n\nThe physics department is planning a memorial for Mehen that will be scheduled during the spring semester.\n\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox Signup for our weekly newsletter.
