        "article_content": "Brits can see where UFOs have been spotted across the country during the past four years on a map - showing nearly 2,000 extra-terrestrial sightings.\n\nIt has been an intriguing time for UFO enthusiasts around the world with an American fighter jet shooting down an unexplained flying object that was later identified as a Chinese balloon last year. It was suspected of being on a spying mission along with three other objects in or near American airspace.\n\nAnd then whistle-blower Major David Grusch, a former Air Force intelligence officer, set the internet on fire when he claimed the US was concealing a long-standing programme that retrieves and reverse-engineers unidentified flying objects. The intrigue has continued into 2024, with Ukrainian troops recording a huge disc-shaped object over the battlefield of Donetsk, while closer to home a hiker came upon a mysterious monolith on a hilltop in Powys, Wales.\n\nHe initially assumed was \u201csome sort of UFO\u201d, and has since left some speculating it may have been planted by aliens. But despite increasing speculation about alien visitors online the skies above the UK have been relatively quiet in the past year and we are no closer to finding out if we are not alone in the universe.\n\nIn its annual report, the research group UFO Identified documented 395 sightings in the UK in 2023 - a 20% drop from 497 sightings in 2022 and lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484). That adds up to 1,789 sightings in four years. Information was taken from social media, newspaper reports, and over 50 Freedom of Information requests, as well as from reports made directly to UFO spotter groups around the UK.\n\nAccording to the report, people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39). That is broadly similar to the location of sightings in 2022 and 2021. Over the four years UFO Identified has documented the phenomenon, the highest number of sightings have been seen in the South East (233), followed by the North West (218) and then the South West (193). The lowest number of sightings have been reported in Northern Ireland (30), and the North East of England (63).\n\nWhile flying saucers and other unexplained phenomena were most likely to be spotted in the North West or the South East, the data shows that the best time to see a UFO last year was on a Monday evening between 9pm and 10pm. The most common sighting was a \u201cstar-like\u201d UFO, followed by an orb - with several different witnesses reporting clusters of orbs in the skies across different locations.\n\nThe vast majority of sightings were of far-off objects in the sky, but there were 27 \u201cClose Encounters of the First Kind\u201d, more than double the previous year. These are reports of UFOs seen up close, at a distance of no more than 500 feet away. There were also two \u201cClose Encounters of the Second Kind\u201d which is when a UFO sighting appears to cause a physical effect, such as a car malfunction, a ground impression, or a reaction in animals.\n\nSightings documented last year include:"

Wells\u2019 novel and Orson Welles\u2019 infamous 1938 radio broadcast, which terrified listeners into thinking an actual alien invasion was happening.\n\nSo, why, despite officials debunking sightings and claiming it\u2019s just a weather balloon (again!), do we keep tuning in to these shows and movies that feed the UFO narrative? Simple: it\u2019s more fun to believe.\n\n(Walter Wanger Productions, Inc./Screenshot)\n\nFor one, TV and movies make it look cool. Sci-fi has always been about expanding our horizons, and let\u2019s face it \u2014 humans love a good mystery.\n\nThe idea that we\u2019re part of something bigger, that our little blue planet could be on someone\u2019s galactic radar, is exciting.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the possibility that we\u2019re not alone. And Hollywood knows exactly how to package that excitement.\n\nStephen Spielberg\u2019s Close Encounters of the Third Kind set the standard for this kind of storytelling, showing us that contact with extraterrestrial life could be just as awe-inspiring as it is terrifying.\n\nThat tradition continued with movies like E.T., which gave us heartwarming connections, and Independence Day, which showed us the destructive potential of alien invasions on a massive scale.\n\n(Eduardo Araquel/HISTORY)\n\nOn top of that, let\u2019s be honest: we just don\u2019t trust the government to tell us the whole truth. Every time they release a new report saying, \u201cNope, no aliens here,\u201d it feels like they\u2019re hiding something.\n\nTV shows like Project Blue Book fed into that paranoia, reminding us that the truth might be out there, but we\u2019re definitely not getting it from Uncle Sam.\n\nIt\u2019s also the perfect escape. Aliens, UFOs, and intergalactic mysteries allow us to look beyond our daily grind and think, \u201cWhat if?\u201d\n\nWhat if those lights in the sky really aren\u2019t from Earth? What if we are being watched? And what if, just maybe, Mulder was right all along?\n\nBut what about you? Do you believe? Or, like Mulder, do you just want to believe?"

        "article_content": "AI can assist everywhere from your email apps to fast food outlets. Now Amazon is keen to be involved in the AI revolution with an AI bot called Rufus, which can answer questions, research products, and help you make the right buying decisions across Amazon.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re stuck for a gift idea for someone special in your life, or you need to compare two products against each other. From asking about your active orders to checking up on the details of something you\u2019re thinking about buying, Rufus can help\u2014and here\u2019s how you can find it.\n\nHow Rufus works, and where to find it\n\nRufus might offer prompt suggestions based on your browsing history. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini, Rufus is very much along the same lines. It\u2019s trained on \u201cAmazon\u2019s extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web\u201d, which it then sifts through, connects together, and summarizes to respond to your questions.\n\nThese bots, however, don\u2019t just copy and paste information\u2014they\u2019re designed to generate fresh and original responses, so (as always with these AI models) mistakes can be made. Amazon says Rufus \u201cmay not always get things right,\u201d so it\u2019s worth double-checking important details\u2014don\u2019t assume everything Rufus sells is 100 percent correct, and don\u2019t share private or personal information with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Amazon Shopping app for Android or iOS, you\u2019ll find Rufus on the right of the navigation bar at the bottom (the Rufus logo is two blobs with a star next to them): Tap the button to bring up a chat window and start asking questions. If you\u2019re shopping through the Amazon website, you\u2019ll see the Rufus button up on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top.\n\nStraight away, Rufus will make suggestions about questions to ask\u2014some of these may be related to recent searches or recent purchases. Click or tap on any of the suggestions, or enter your own question or prompt, and Rufus springs into action.\n\nAfter each response, you get the opportunity to ask follow-up questions (Rufus will remember the conversation history), and rate the responses you\u2019ve been given (via the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons). You can clear your chat history in Rufus, but only in the app, and not on the web: Tap on the three dots (top right), then choose Manage chat and Clear chat history.\n\nQuestions and prompts to try with Rufus\n\nOne of the ways to use the bot is to ask questions about products. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nRufus knows what you\u2019re looking at on the Amazon platform, so you can ask it questions about a product you\u2019ve got up on screen. You can ask how much an item weighs, for example, or which materials it\u2019s made of, or what the battery life is like. In some cases, the bot will make direct reference to something in the listing.\n\nGoing beyond individual product pages, Rufus can answer shopping questions more generally. You might want to ask what the best tool is for a particular job, or how two specific items compare to each other, or what a certain item actually does (and how). You can ask about trends in product categories as well\u2014and see what\u2019s proving popular with other shoppers, for instance.\n\nYou can get quite creative with these questions. For example, you\u2019re able to ask about the tools and materials needed to make a garden shed, or about presents that would be suitable for a 5-year-old child\u2019s birthday, or about extras you might need for a dinner party. Any kind of advice you need, Rufus will attempt to give you some pointers.\n\nThis is where Rufus becomes more like other generative AI chatbots out there: If you\u2019re stuck for shopping inspiration, or you\u2019re not sure how two types of TV tech compare, then you can get answers. The questions you ask don\u2019t have to be specifically about what\u2019s being sold on Amazon, though you are quite likely to see links to see some related items on the site anyway.\n\nFinally, you can also chat with Rufus about the status of your current orders, or the last time you ordered (for example) packing tape. Sometimes you\u2019ll get a direct answer, and sometimes you\u2019ll be given a link for a relevant page on the Amazon site to follow. And if you\u2019re wondering how Amazon came up with the name, by the way, then it\u2019s to do with one of Amazon\u2019s earliest employees."

        "article_content": "By Aveekshith Bushan\n\nThe intersection of AI and consumer services is rapidly evolving, and multi-model AI applications are at the forefront of this transformation. Multi-model AI is a breakthrough in artificial intelligence due to its ability to integrate multiple data types, making human-computer interactions more natural and intuitive. According to industry reports, the global multi-model AI market, valued at approximately $893.5 million in 2023, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.2%, reaching $1050 billion by 2031. Businesses can leverage multi-model AI by breaking the text barrier and incorporating various forms of data by combining key-value, vector, and graph searches to offer more personalised and efficient consumer experiences.\n\nConsider common household examples like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. They rely on multi-model AI systems to evaluate user interactions in the form of speech and text for generating exact responses and learning behavioural patterns for subsequent interactions. These AI applications mark a new era of digital personal interactions.\n\nAlso Read The Bot-tom line: The real cost of digital fraud India pushes for global standards on digital public infra, AI Can AI supercharge Performance Marketing without crossing ethical lines? Think critically about impact of AI, Industry 4.0, geopolitics & other drivers of change\n\nEnhancing Personalization with Key-Value Stores\n\nKey-value databases play a crucial role in enabling personalisation at scale, allowing businesses to cater to millions of users with real-time, tailored content and recommendations. With contextual intelligence, these stores help applications quickly retrieve user-specific information and contribute to improved decision-making by processing vast amounts of data efficiently. For example, e-commerce platforms use them to store user preferences and browsing history and to suggest related products for highly personalised interaction.\n\nOptimizing Search with Vector Databases\n\nVector search allows businesses to handle complex, unstructured data such as images, audio, or videos. Vector databases are also invaluable in areas like voice and image recognition, which are becoming prevalent in consumer applications.\n\nVector searches work by embedding data into numerical formats that allow AI to identify similarities between different pieces of content. This helps with improving the accuracy of recommendations and with handling diverse data types for a richer consumer experience. For instance, if a user watches a specific type of movie, a vector database can suggest other movies with similar themes or visual styles based on how closely the data matches, going beyond traditional keyword-based searches to identify deeper connections between data points.\n\nGraph Databases for Complex Relationships\n\nWhile key-value and vector databases handle personalisation and unstructured data, graph databases excel at mapping complex relationships between data points. Businesses can use graphs to understand how different entities are interconnected, such as users, products, or behaviours. This ensures better user engagement through relationship mapping and enhanced network-based recommendations\n\nSocial media platforms rely on graph searches to uncover connections between users, interests, and interactions, allowing for more relevant and meaningful recommendations. For example, graphs help with analysing user connections, identifying influencers, and recommending friends or content based on mutual interests.\n\nThe Power of Multi-Model AI\n\nThe true power of multi-model AI lies in its ability to integrate these different data models into a single, unified system. By combining key-value, vector, and graph, businesses can create more sophisticated and intuitive consumer interactions. An e-commerce platform, for example, may use key-value stores to retrieve customer data instantly, vector searches to recommend visually similar products, and graph databases to suggest items based on previous purchases.\n\nIn combination, these models provide highly personalised experiences tailored to each user\u2019s specific needs and behaviour, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This approach paves the way for the next generation of consumer innovation, where AI seamlessly enhances personalisation, search accuracy, and relevance across platforms.\n\nThe author is vice president and GM, APJ, Aerospike.

But for one 53 year old lady, the answer lay in a cutting-edge app designed to tailor your health regimen with AI-driven daily exercises, coaching, and nutritional insights.\n\nOhio nurse Chrissy Clark, 53, embarked on a transformative health journey following a serious health warning. \"Back in January I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I was severely obese,\" she shared.\n\nAccording to Chrissy, her weight was way over the top for someone of her stature: \"For my height, I was really overweight.

She now enthuses: \"I am happier, I am healthier, I have more energy.\"\n\nThe first thing Chrissy did was seek her doctor's approval, which she got along with a tip to keep her weight loss to no more than 2lbs a week. The app gets personal right from the start you complete a questionnaire about your health objectives, preferences, and your dieting history. From your input, the app crafts daily exercise routines just for you, breaks down your meals' nutritional content, and offers an AI in-app coach for any queries along the way.\n\nChrissy swears by the app, confessing she \"would be lost\" without it. If you're itching to try it out, Simple is currently dangling a carrot with a 60% discount using the code SIMPLEDEAL. Click here to kickstart your 28-day challenge, but remember it's wise to chat with your GP before you dive into any significant lifestyle shakeup, especially one involving fasting a key element of the Simple App ethos.\n\nAffiliates Lead Tom Capon was full of praise for the app, noting: \"Simple's range of features are very reminiscent to what you'd get with a personal trainer: someone to hold you accountable, provide you with meal plans and recipes, and to give advice and encouragement.\"\n\nJoining the chorus of approval is Virginia's own Kelly Hartmann, who shed an impressive 15lbs in just four months, thanks to the app. She shared, \"Simple helped keep me on track with my weightloss journey by tracking what I was eating, what I was drinking and how often I was moving my body... What I liked most about Simple is you do not have to be tech savvy to use it.\"\n\nYet, not all feedback echoes the same tune on Trustpilot, where Simple has snagged 4.1 stars out of 5. Dive into the user reviews and you'll find mixed feelings: a user expressed their perspective, \"I think that the app is too expensive for the lack of breakdown in your diet entries. But it keeps me on schedule,\" Meanwhile, another user called for more variety, particularly saying it \"needs more choices when logging beverages, for example I drink my coffee with honey & half and half milk\".\n\nThere are other health and weight loss apps available, like Noom, which comes with a price tag of about \u00a312.50 per month. MyFitnessPal is another option that assists in tracking your food and calorie consumption, offering a free level of service, but with the option to pay for additional perks."

        "article_content": "By Jake Spring\n\n(Reuters) - For more than five decades as violent conflict raged through Colombia's highlands and rainforests, wildlife thrived.\n\nFrom brilliantly colored orchids to tiger-striped frogs, scientists have uncovered a wealth of new animal and plant species in the years since a 2016 peace deal saw most rebels with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) lay down their weapons. The accord made it safe to enter many parts of the country, often pristinely preserved amid the conflict.\n\nPeace, it turned out, offered a boon for nature research. Scientists have found roughly triple the number of new plant species in Colombia each year since the peace accord as they did before the deal, according to a new analysis by Colombian botanist Oscar Alejandro Perez-Escobar shared exclusively with Reuters.\n\nBut the FARC deal did not end Colombia's conflict. Though the accord opened many areas of Colombia up for science, other armed groups - including former FARC fighters who rejected the peace deal - and crime gangs filled the vacuum in some areas and brought renewed dangers for both researchers and wildlife.\n\nAlthough deforestation fell to a 23-year low last year, it is on the rise again in 2024 as severe drought fed wildfires, and illegal logging, mining and roadbuilding destroyed the jungle. And for environmentalists, Colombia is now the world's most dangerous place \u2013 with 79 killed last year, the most ever in one country in a single year, according to nonprofit Global Witness.\n\nThe analysis of some 14,000 Colombian plant species recorded at Royal Botanic Gardens Kew showed that researchers have published an average of 178 new finds in the years since the peace deal. That compares with 53 on average in the years before the accord.\n\nThe analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed, also accounted for the imbalance between the few years of data since 2016 as compared to centuries of prior species discovery.\n\nWhile the analysis shows a jump in publications after the peace deal, it does not prove the accord was the cause, Perez-Escobar said.\n\nHe recalled his first expedition after the peace deal, traveling with a team of researchers from 16 countries through a mountainous ecosystem as Colombian soldiers guarded their moves in 2018.\n\n\"I was excited, but also nervous,\" said Perez-Escobar, who works for Kew Gardens in Britain. \"Excited of the prospects of finding new species ... but also nervous because of the danger it represented going there.\"\n\nThat expedition was part of a wave of biodiversity research in Colombia's former rebel strongholds, which scientists had steered clear of for fear of kidnapping or death at the hands of the FARC. On the trek high above the treeline into the mountainous Paramo ecosystem, he spotted small yellow-and-brown flowers - a new species of orchid. A paramo is a very moist, cold and often foggy alpine grassland high up in the Andes.\n\nSince then, Perez-Escobar working in partnership with local organizations has helped to identify two new flowering plants in a cloud forest and last year the first known polymorphic orchid in its genus of 1,200 species, meaning it blooms two different types of flowers on the same plant.\n\nCROCODILES, DRONES & DEFORESTATION\n\nAs a biology student in the 1990s, botanist Mauricio Diazgranados would collect plants in the mountains an hour's drive from Bogota.\n\n\"I could see the helicopters shooting at the guerrillas and the guerrillas fighting back,\" said Diazgranados who now works as science director of the New York Botanical Garden.\n\nAt one point, he worked as a volunteer park ranger in the Sumapaz area where the FARC once kept its headquarters. He said he was once detained by rebels on suspicion of spying but managed to escape during the night and flee.\n\nDiazgranados later helped to organize dozens of science expeditions into previously dangerous areas under Colombia BIO, a government program launched to better understand the country's wilds after the peace deal. He still has cardboard boxes filled with dried plant samples that he thinks are new species but has yet to describe in publication.\n\nWhile the conflict may have helped to shelter Colombia's wildlife for decades, it is the country's location and geography that helped it to flourish into what it is today.\n\nLocated near the warm band of the Equator where North and South America meet, the country includes beaches, tropical rainforests and three distinct chains of the Andes that soar from deep valleys to more than 5,000 meters (17,000 feet). The diversity of these environments has encouraged more species to evolve over time.\n\nColombia topped a list this year of countries thought to have the most undiscovered plant species, according to a study led by Kew Gardens scientists that was published in August.\n\nIt is not only the peace deal that is driving more discoveries, Diazgranados said. More trained scientists are researching Colombia than ever, he said, including some turning away from nearby Venezuela amid the economic and political crisis there.\n\nScientists at Colombia's state-run Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute have found dozens of new species including beetles, frogs, a spider and a caecilian - a rare group of legless amphibians that live underground. It can take several years for a species find to be confirmed as new.\n\n\"They were inaccessible areas, but also areas with enormous information and natural wealth,\" said Jhon Cesar Neita, who curates Humboldt's entomology and invertebrate collection, about former FARC-held areas that opened up to research.\n\n\"All of us scientists wanted to go.\"\n\nScientists with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) have also recorded another 10 amphibian finds, including a green-brown striped rain frog to be named for Colombia's peace deal: Pristimantis pactumpacis.\n\nAfter the peace deal, WCS researchers were able to use drones to count eastern Colombia's critically endangered Orinoco crocodiles in an area previously too dangerous, said the group's Colombia director, German Forero.\n\nBut after more than 100 people were reported killed in violence related to armed groups in the area this year, Forero said, WCS staff currently cannot travel back to where the Orinoco crocodile lives.\n\nLOSING GAINS\n\nColombia has put the security issue in focus at this year's U.N. Biodiversity Conference, COP16, choosing the theme \"Peace with Nature\" for the event being held in the southwestern Colombian city of Cali. More than 10,000 soldiers, police and U.N. guards are mobilized to protect the summit, while delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss how best to preserve nature worldwide.\n\nThere is currently intense fighting between the armed groups in some of the most biodiverse parts of the country, according to sources within the Colombian military. In the Pacific province of Choco, home to verdant rainforest and famously wet weather, the ELN rebels are fighting the Clan del Golfo crime gang, while competing FARC dissident groups face off in several Amazon provinces.\n\nAlong with continuing violence by armed groups, Colombia is now also at risk of rapid environmental decline, scientists warned. Deforestation has jumped 40% in the first three months of this year, according to government data.\n\nEnvironment Minister Susana Muhamad in April blamed a group of former FARC fighters called the Estado Mayor Central for the forest clearing in the Amazon rainforest, saying it blocks outsiders from entering areas it controls while pressuring locals to cooperate.\n\n\"It's miserable, the psychological pressure that the armed groups are exerting on the communities,\" Muhamad said in an April statement. \"In this case, they are putting nature in the middle of the conflict.\"\n\nThe faction of the recently-splintered EMC led by Alexander Diaz Mendoza, better known by his nom de guerre Calarca Cordoba, said in a statement the group has no involvement in deforestation and works with communities to boost sustainable practices. The group said it blocks entry in order to prevent government efforts to \"financialize\" the forest through products like green bonds.\n\n(Reporting by Jake Spring in Sao Paulo; Additional reporting by Javier Andres Rojas and Luisa Gonzalez in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, and Luis Jaime Acosta in Bogota; Editing by Katy Daigle and Claudia Parsons)"

        "article_content": "The first dinosaur fossils discovered in Hong Kong may provide valuable insights into the Cretaceous period\u2019s terrestrial ecosystems in South China and bring new blood to the academic field, experts have said.\n\nBut a veteran geologist expressed concerns that the fascinating find could result in lasting damage to nature, adding that the city\u2019s curriculum design had misled students interested in geology into selecting a social science subject.\n\nThe experts\u2019 remarks were made before a group of fossil rocks found on Port Island in the Hong Kong Unesco Global Geopark was due to be shown to the public for the first time on Friday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nYoung Ng Chun-yeong, former chairman of the Association for Geoconservation and a key proponent of the geopark designation, said he expected the discovery to reignite public interest in geoscience and deliver long-term benefits to academia.\n\n\u201cBefore having the geopark, most people thought that Hong Kong was mainly a city and a concrete forest, without paying special attention to the natural rock foundations that we have,\u201d said Ng, who now chairs an ecotourism strategy reference group of the Australian Geoscience Council.\n\n\u201cNow that dinosaur fossils have been discovered, people will again notice that the natural foundation of Hong Kong is quite spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe star attraction of the geopark has long been the hexagonal rock columns in Sai Kung, which were formed when a supervolcano erupted 140 million years ago.\n\nNg said that with the finding, \u201ca new story will emerge\u201d that will also put the sedimentary rock formations in other parts of the geopark under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cNew stories will create new excitement, especially for teenagers as they are particularly interested in dinosaurs. So we can use the fossils as an attraction to stimulate teenagers\u2019 interest in this aspect, which will drive interest in future learning,\u201d he said.\n\nNg added that the greater interest from students might also make geoscience research topics popular at universities, which could eventually lead to an increase in researchers and resources in the city\u2019s Earth science academia.\n\nThe fossils belonged to an undetermined kind of dinosaur that dated to the Cretaceous period about 145 million to 66 million years ago.\n\nPalaeontologist Fion Ma Wai-sum said that no animal could survive alone in the wild. She explained that the discovery suggested there was an ecosystem in the vicinity of the island during prehistoric times.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helps to provide a full picture of the dinosaurs living in South China in the past,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that it was plausible that experts would find even more fossils on the island, not only dinosaurs but other animals and plants.\n\nShe also expressed hopes that more resources would be allocated to relevant research, education and outreach activities due to the new discovery and the scientific significance of it.\n\nMichael Pittman, assistant professor at the school of life sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said experts will compare the fossils found in the city with those from mainland China after conducting scientific research to determine the exact type of dinosaur.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that we can find out with further study,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the new finds lead to additional resources for the further expansion of paleontological studies in the city, that would be fantastic.\u201d\n\nChan Lung-sang, a visiting professor of the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, said he doubted sufficient resources would ever be properly allocated to support geological studies in Hong Kong because geology was often considered as a marginal subject at schools.\n\n\u201cAlthough many students are passionate about topics like rocks, fossils and weather, they are frequently directed toward studying geography, which is primarily social studies ... The current school curriculum design, unfortunately, is not conducive to a proper earth science education in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe veteran geologist, who curated the new palaeontology gallery that opened last year at the Science Museum, also cautioned against attempts to commercially exploit scientific discovery.\n\n\u201cMy greatest concern is that fascinating discoveries, such as the dinosaur bone fossils, could end up being leveraged for economic initiatives, like promoting \u2018dinosaur bone tourism\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to infrastructure development in our country parks, eventually resulting in irreversible changes to our natural heritage.\u201d\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2024."

        "article_content": "Google's new Quick Share app for Windows just got the bug fixes it needed from the start\n\nGoogle is rolling out a Quick Share update for Windows devices.\n\nThe Update focuses on optimizing the app's performance on the platform, and squashes several bugs. It doesn't bring any new features.\n\nGoogle is also testing out a percentage indicator for transfer progress on mobile. The change is yet to roll out widely.\n\nSamsung and Google's merged Quick Share is a convenient file-sharing app. Available on Android, ChromeOS, and Windows, the app lets users transmit photos, videos, documents, audio files, and even entire folders through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct.\n\nFor mobile users, the application is set to gain support for file transmission over mobile data. Windows users, on the other hand, are receiving an update too, and although it isn't as exciting as mobile data support, it is necessary for the application's overall stability.\n\nThe update focuses solely on optimizing the application for Windows devices and squashing bugs that have long-plagued the app, bringing Quick Share to v1.0.2002.2 on Windows, as spotted by 9to5Google. A rundown of all the changes can be found below:\n\nFixed to delete files received from an unknown sender with the same payload ID.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when a file name has non-ASCII characters.\n\nFixed an issue where non-ASCII characters prevented received files from opening successfully.\n\nFixed an issue when reading preferences.\n\nFixed an issue where preferences failed to save on certain system configurations.\n\nFixed an issue that kept the Quick Share shortcut icon from showing up in the Start menu after installation.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when reading an input file.\n\nFixed an issue that caused multiple GATT reads during discovery.\n\nFixed a bug to stop Wi-Fi LAN advertising.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when connecting to Bluetooth.\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the Wi-Fi hotspot profile from being deleted correctly.\n\nFixed an issue where the Wi-Fi hotspot couldnt be recovered when the app was closed during file transfer.\n\nGet ready for an improved mobile app UI as well\n\nThe update follows version 1.0.1939.4, which improved the app's animations, added car and foldable devices to the list of device types, alongside support for credential expiration. It's worth noting that the Quick Share app on the Microsoft Store is Samsung's iteration, and currently only works with Samsung devices. Google's unified version of the app for Windows devices is only available through its own website.\n\nIn other Quick Share-related news, Google seems to be testing out a UI tweak for the app on mobile that brings it closer to the desktop counterpart. For reference, Quick Share on Windows shows an estimate of the time remaining alongside the transfer speed during an active transfer. As part of a recent test, users on mobile have now started spotting a percentage-based progress bar, resulting in more precise transfer progress tracking. The change seems to be part of an A/B test, and hasn't rolled out widely yet."
