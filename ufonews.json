        "article_content": "To keep the ghosts at bay, read on for Entertainment Weekly\u2019s list of the 30 best paranormal movies, ranked.\n\nParanormal movies mainly preside in the horror and thriller genres, but there are a few comedic or dramatic exceptions. Almost all of them offer audiences an indelible glimpse of the supernatural that real life, for better or worse, doesn\u2019t afford us. There\u2019s nothing like that implacable tingle, that crawling dread, of films like these.\n\nOne has to wonder how ghosts and ghouls have time to haunt us when they\u2019re so preoccupied acting in paranormal movies. Certainly, the genre lets us live vicariously through (often ill-fated) characters who either summon or accidentally encounter some of the other side\u2019s residents.\n\n30. Paranormal Activity (2007) Everett Collection Oren Peli\u2019s genre-defining found footage thriller stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat as a couple who believes their suburban home might be beset by malevolent forces of some kind. With the help of a handy digital camera, the pair set out to find the source of the nightly disturbances. The Paranormal Activity franchise has gone so far down the rabbit hole that it\u2019s easy to forget its ultra-simple, stripped-back roots. Peli structures his picture in the seamless style of old-school horror-thrillers, first by establishing the characters and then spinning scares from their relationship that further exacerbate the bumps in the night. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n29. Session 9 (2001) Everett Brad Anderson\u2019s skin-crawling ghost story follows a group of sanitation workers (led by David Caruso and Josh Lucas) who encounter some creepy goings-on, and even spookier recordings of therapy sessions, when they\u2019re sent to clean out a disused mental asylum. Journeyman director Anderson outdid himself with this rollicking yet understated horror-fest, which executes its finest scares without using much more than its ingeniously unsettling sound design. Where to watch Session 9: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n28. The Frighteners (1996) Everett Peter Jackson\u2019s jolly horror-comedy finds an architect turned exorcist (Michael J. Fox), who\u2019s able to communicate with departed spirits, trying to solve the mounting body count in his idyllic small town while romancing the widow (Trini Alvarado) of one of the victims. Nobody does their respective jobs as well as Jackson and Fox do theirs, and to see these two working together is almost too much goodness to behold. The Frighteners is just as goofy and splattery as you want a Jackson genre picture to be, anchored in a solid mystery and Fox\u2019s preternatural ability to command the screen. Where to watch The Frighteners: Tubi\n\n27. Insidious (2010) Everett Collection Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) move their family to what should be an idyllic suburban home; but when one of their children falls ill, the Lamberts uncover a much darker reason behind his ailment. James Wan\u2019s haunted house picture essentially birthed Blumhouse\u2019s brand of inexpensive, wildly lucrative horror. In the same vein of Paranormal Activity, Wan\u2019s film launched a sprawling franchise with a simple, effective formula that packed an additional wallop for having been absent from cinemas for some time by the 2010s. Where to watch Insidious: Peacock\n\n26. It Follows (2014) Everett David Robert Mitchell\u2019s astonishing paranormal picture has spawned a litany of imitators, none of which match It Follows\u2019 distinctive mix of mood, high-concept plotting, and propulsive fear. Jay (Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover he\u2019s passed along a fatal curse that she can only shake by sleeping with another person. And so it begins its shape-shifting pursuit \u2014 slow, deliberate, agonizingly persistent. Mitchell conjures a maddening sense of dread out of the simplest techniques; once we\u2019ve seen the entity walking toward Jay, every person casually moving in the background feels like a threat. Of course, It Follows is as much about growing up as it is about fear and sex \u2014 or, rather, it\u2019s about what\u2019s scary about growing up, the dying of the youthful presumption of safety, protection, and immortality. Where to watch It Follows: Netflix\n\n25. The Amityville Horror (1979) Everett Collection This classic haunted house tale tells the unfortunate \u201ctrue\u201d story of George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder), who buy a rambling house on Long Island only to discover its murderous past and supernatural inhabitants. A tremendously effective horror story that takes its time to eke out substantial frights, Stuart Rosenberg\u2019s completely over-the-top vision of yuppie-dom gone awry kicked off one of Hollywood\u2019s most dubious franchises. Though a few of the sequels have their merits, Amityville in Space and Amityville Karen remain for completists only. Where to watch The Amityville Horror: Max\n\n24. Sinister (2012) Phil Caruso/Summit Entertainment Scott Derrickson\u2019s brilliant found footage-cum-haunted house tale stars Ethan Hawke as a morally murky true crime journalist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and kids into the home where a brutal family murder took place, the inspiration for his latest book. Things go badly, and only get worse when Hawke finds a box of 16mm snuff films in the attic. Derrickson is a woefully underrated horror director, and Sinister is his crowning achievement. The gory recordings are photographed in a surrealistic, utterly chilling manner, and, set to Christopher Young\u2019s masterful industrial score, they carry an uncommon power. Where to watch Sinister: Max\n\n23. Child\u2019s Play (1988) United Artists/Everett Tom Holland\u2019s franchise kick-off finds the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transferred into a cherubic Good Guys doll named Chucky. When the toy makes its way into the home of Andy (Alex Vincent) and his exhausted mother (Catherine Hicks), only a dedicated detective (Chris Sarandon) can stop the bloodshed. Holland treats the idea of a loony murderer\u2019s spirit occupying a doll\u2019s form with an uncommon seriousness. Though some of the later installments veered into comedy, this original makes a compelling case for taking Chucky very seriously indeed. Where to watch Child\u2019s Play: Tubi\n\n22. Final Destination 2 (2003) Everett Collection David R. Ellis\u2019 wildly entertaining first sequel in the admirably consistent franchise follows a group of spring-break revelers (led by A.J. Cook and returning star Ali Larter) who manage to avoid a catastrophic highway pileup only to find themselves being picked off, one by one, by that dreaded specter known as Death. Breathtakingly gory and hell-bent on a very particular type of early-aughts destruction, Final Destination 2 is a slasher movie crossed with something approaching a supernatural action film. It\u2019s remarkably entertaining and always rewatchable, with a few murder set pieces that will make you genuinely wince. Where to watch Final Destination 2: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. Ringu (1998) Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter, sets out with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to investigate the ghostly phenomenon of a disturbing videotape that seemingly killed her niece. Hideo Nakata\u2019s seminal fright flick kicked off a sprawling franchise across several continents, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Ringu possesses a singular sort of fear that few films can pull off. Watching it leaves you with that unshakeable, unpleasant feeling of recalling too vividly a particularly disturbing nightmare. Where to watch Ringu: Tubi\n\n20. The Others (2001) Everett Collection Grace (Nicole Kidman) moves with her children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), who possess a sunlight allergy, into an isolated country cottage as she awaits the return of her husband from fighting in WWII. There, the arrival of a governess (Fionnula Flanagan) and her peers kicks off a series of horrifying supernatural occurrences that threaten to unravel Grace\u2019s reality. A wonderfully paced, brazenly old-fashioned ghost story, The Others feels timeless as all the best horror films do. Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar directs with a lush eye for atmosphere and details, while the oft-imitated twist ending feels earned and emotionally cathartic. Where to watch The Others: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n19. The Eye (2002) Everett The Pang Brothers\u2019 ultra-spooky immersion into the supernatural underworld stars Angelica Lee as Mun, a prodigious blind musician who is gifted sight with a radical corneal transplant. Yet as she\u2019s tormented by visions of the dead, Mun wonders if sight is worth her mental sanity. One of Hong Kong\u2019s signature modern thrillers, The Eye got swept up in American audiences\u2019 fascination with Asian horror from the late \u201990s through the aughts, later receiving an obligatory remake in 2008 starring Jessica Alba. Like most modern horror encores, that version is best left unseen; it can\u2019t match the Pangs\u2019 contemporary twist on classical, spine-tingling fright. Where to watch The Eye: Not available to stream\n\n18. The Beyond (1981) Everett Collection Lucio Fulci\u2019s paranormal masterwork concerns a young woman (Catriona MacColl) who inherits a palatial hotel that sits above the gates of hell. Predictably, things don\u2019t go so well for her. To define what the experience of The Beyond is actually like is\u2026 well, if you\u2019ll forgive the paraphrased steal from Casablanca, it\u2019s like any other Italian horror movie, only more so. Fulci embraces nightmare logic as enthusiastically as any filmmaker of his genre or generation, and this film is him at his gorily most unhinged. He indulges his penchant for toe-curling eyeball violence and subtly effective set design in this everything-and-the-kitchen-sink haunted house riff. Where to watch The Beyond: Peacock\n\n17. Jennifer\u2019s Body (2009) Doane Gregory/TM and Fox Atomic/Courtesy Everett Collection Karyn Kusama\u2019s supernatural high-school dark comedy, written by Diablo Cody, is utterly excellent despite its initially lackluster reviews. Amanda Seyfried plays Needy Lesnicky, the dowdy best friend to the popular/hot/cool/flexible Jennifer Check (Megan Fox). When Jennifer is sacrificed as part of a devilish ritual by a skeevy rock band, she returns as a succubus with a taste for teenage boys\u2019 flesh. Jennifer\u2019s Body is one of those perfect fusions of time and place, capturing that mid-aughts period when pop culture was paradoxically alt. Cody also flexes her sprawling knowledge of the horror genre, making for a riotously entertaining film with a ferocious satirical undercurrent. Where to watch Jennifer\u2019s Body: Tubi\n\n16. Talk to Me (2022) A24 This recent A24 effort from Australian directors Danny and Michael Philippou is one of the studio\u2019s scariest outputs yet. A mummified hand that can imbue its possessors with both horrifying glimpses of the afterlife and a drug-life euphoria threatens to undo a suburban family when a young boy (the stupendously natural Joe Bird) spends too long on the other side and becomes possessed. Remarkably unsettling and shockingly brutal, Talk to Me is a singular horror film that ranks among this decade\u2019s finest. With a smart application of style and humor, the Philippous crafted a relentless modern chiller. Where to watch Talk to Me: Paramount+\n\n15. Suspiria (1977) 20th Century Studios Dario Argento\u2019s groundbreaking opera of furious sight and sound concerns young Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), who upon being sent to a prestigious German ballet academy discovers that it is but a front for a coven of youth-siphoning witches. Argento\u2019s galvanizing picture remains a masterclass in harnessing the power of image and music to beguile an audience. It also feels as fresh and exciting today as it did almost 50 years ago. Where to watch Suspiria: Xumo Play\n\n14. Lake Mungo (2008) Mungo Productions After their teenage daughter (Talia Zucker) drowns, a family begins experiencing strange events in their home. They call in a paranormal psychologist, who uncovers disturbing secrets while parsing through their surveillance camera and cell phone footage. This is a particularly somber and understated movie, resembling domestic dramas like Ordinary People more than traditional horror films. With a canny mix of found footage and faux-documentary, Lake Mungo transports the audience into its spare, chilling universe. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n13. Hereditary (2018) Toni Collette; Hereditary. A24 Ari Aster\u2019s astonishingly original yet somehow terrifically old-fashioned ghost-and-witchcraft story stars Toni Collette as a bereaved mother who turns to the paranormal in the hopes of contacting family members she\u2019s recently lost. As the supposedly well-intentioned woman leading her to doom, Ann Dowd commits to one of the most insidious villain performances in modern horror history. The movie that established Aster as an art-house freakout auteur, Hereditary is breathtakingly, exhaustively intense and frequently just as emotional. That Collette didn\u2019t collect an Oscar nomination for this role is a stain on the Academy. Where to watch Hereditary: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n12. The Orphanage (2007) Everett Collection J.A. Bayona directed this Spanish production about a young woman (Bel\u00e9n Rueda) who buys the orphanage in which she grew up with the intention of converting it into a home for infirm children. When her son goes missing, she turns to the many ghosts residing within the home to aid her desperate search. More than a bit inspired by Guillermo del Toro\u2019s The Devil\u2019s Backbone, The Orphanage weaves a similarly melancholy and thematically rich haunted house tale that calls on the country\u2019s complicated past to inflect its plot with verisimilitude. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s exceptionally scary. Where to watch The Orphanage: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n11. Jacob\u2019s Ladder (1990) Everett Adrian Lyne\u2019s mind-warping erotic thriller stars Tim Robbins as a Vietnam vet plagued with horrifying hallucinations once he returns stateside. As he discovers he's not the only member of his platoon to experience such oddities, Jacob is further removed from his already tenuous reality. A thoughtful and enveloping exploration of psychosis, Lyne\u2019s film remains a high-water mark in the psychological freak-out genre. Robbins grounds the eccentric proceedings with his reliable everyman persona, while Lynne one-ups his signature opulent visual style in such a way that he often wrong-foots the audience\u2019s genre expectations with nothing more than a simple camera move. Where to watch Jacob\u2019s Ladder: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10. The Sixth Sense (1999) Everett Collection Young Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is plagued by visions of those who died violent deaths. His exasperated mother (Toni Collette) seeks help in the form of a psychologist (Bruce Willis), who may have more in common with Cole than he thinks. M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s classic ghost story popularized a now-ubiquitous twist ending and got all of us swearing we saw dead people. It\u2019s still a hard-edged, substantially creepy fable with a heart-wrenching central performance from Osment and some of Willis\u2019 best dramatic acting. Where to watch The Sixth Sense: Max\n\n9. Cat People (1942) Everett Collection A well-intentioned husband (Kent Smith) accidentally ignites his wife\u2019s (Simone Simon) supernatural curse, in which she transforms into a large feline when aroused. She then goes about stalking her nemeses, including the beautiful woman (Jane Randolph) with whom her partner has become infatuated. Jacques Tourneur\u2019s fabulously creepy and macabre exploration of jealous sexual awakening features some unbelievably detailed sets and camerawork that seem innovative even today. Far from the staid paranormal horrors produced during this period, Cat People is ferocious and mysterious in equal measure. Where to watch Cat People: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n8. Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968) Courtesy Everett Collection Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s satirical shocker stars Mia Farrow as a young housewife who begins to believe her dream pregnancy is a cover for something much more nefarious, as her actor husband (John Cassavetes) brings an eccentric elderly couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) uncomfortably into their lives. Polanski\u2019s picture is elegant yet abrasive, an uncommonly lovely combination. Farrow is terrific in the lead role, getting the audience almost instantly on her side as the director ratchets up the tension to an unbearably chilling climax. Where to watch Rosemary\u2019s Baby: Paramount+\n\n7. Poltergeist (1982) Everett Collection Tobe Hooper\u2019s story about a suburban family (helmed by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) beset by paranormal activity in their new home, which may or may not be built on an ancient burial ground, is completely insane. It\u2019s one of the first horror movies to feel like an out-and-out action (or even disaster) movie, with crumbling sets and flashing lights right out of a Clive Barker climax. Poltergeist has endured, though, because its scares are rooted in this authentic family unit\u2019s terror. We feel for them, and the dissolution of their \u2014 \u201980s American dream. Where to watch Poltergeist: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n6. The Innocents (1961) 20th Century Fox Film Corp./Courtesy Everett Based on Henry James\u2019 The Turn of the Screw, Jack Clayton\u2019s spine-chilling ghost story (with a script by Truman Capote, among others) stars Deborah Kerr as a governess sent to an isolated estate to care for two odd children (Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin). There, she encounters \u2014 what else? \u2014 disembodied voices and vengeful spirits. Clayton\u2019s exceptionally frightening haunted house picture established many of the genre\u2019s most beloved tropes, a great deal of which are still in circulation today. Nearly every film on this list has arguably drawn inspiration from The Innocents. Here, Clayton creates a masterful mood of dread and dense mystery within a rich and oddly cozy atmosphere. Where to watch The Innocents: Not available to stream\n\n5. Hausu (1977) Everett There\u2019s no other way to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s film except for \u201cgenuinely f\u2014ing crazy.\u201d Even to call it a haunted house movie seems tame; it\u2019s more of a spiritual home invasion, really. A group of seven schoolgirls \u2014 all with cheeky names like Kung Fu and Mac (for \u201cstomach,\u201d because she likes to eat) \u2014 venture to the home of one girl\u2019s aunt, where they\u2019re beset by disembodied, bottom-chomping heads, possessed mattresses, and hungry ghosts. Obayashi\u2019s picture is an authentically singular experience, and also a rather sweet one. It plays like a live-action, exaggeratedly silly Studio Ghibli movie. Where to watch Hausu: Max\n\n4. The Haunting (1963) Everett Collection Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of Shirley Jackson\u2019s masterful novella finds a specially selected group of people brought together to spend a night at the famously haunted Hill House. Each has their different motives \u2014 Eleanor (Julie Harris) wishes to separate from her overbearing family; a gregarious psychic (Claire Bloom) hopes to write a bestselling book; Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) wants to uncover the home\u2019s paranormal truth. Joined by the home\u2019s heir (Russ Tamblyn), they set about uncovering the home\u2019s insidious past. Wise crafts an elegant and memorable ghost story here, retaining much of Jackson\u2019s scabrous dialogue while improving upon the suspense set pieces established in her book.\u200b\u200b It\u2019s one of the spookiest, and most elegant, haunted house pictures ever made. Where to watch The Haunting: Tubi\n\n3. The Shining (1980) Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) encounters the Grady twins (Lisa and Louise Burns) inside the Overlook Hotel in 'The Shining.'. Warner Brothers/courtesy Everett Stanley Kubrick\u2019s supernatural opus continues to spark scrutiny and debate almost 50 years later. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a has-been writer, takes a job at the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker so he can write his next novel. Soon, his family (wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd) experiences gory hallucinations and unexplainable events within the corridors. Kubrick\u2019s film is a devastatingly rendered portrait of an artist\u2019s descent into psychosis, one that\u2019s implicit through the pursuit of crafting a great work. The Shining is every bit as meticulous and fetishistic as its reputation would suggest, with Kubrick using his stern directorial hand to create a sense of unease on screen. Where to watch The Shining: Max\n\n2. Evil Dead II (1987) Everett Sam Raimi\u2019s gleeful, gore-gag-laden romp (essentially a higher-budget, more jocular spin on his 1981 original) finds Bruce Campbell\u2019s Ash once again battling a group of Deadites in a remote cabin. Raimi strikes an inimitable tone of feel-good fun that precious few films are able to attain, let alone those in the horror genre. The director previously compared this movie to The Three Stooges with viscera standing in for custard pies, and that\u2019s the precise vibe one feels upon viewing. There\u2019s nothing offensive or off-putting in Evil Dead II, only a merry sense of the possibilities paranormal filmmaking presents. Where to watch Evil Dead II: Plex"

        "article_content": "On the GAIA streaming service, viewers around the world have access to the documentary \"The King of UFOs\" (The King of UFOs, 2024). The film claims that the husband of Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, who died in 2021, was supposed to meet with an alien at some point, the Radar.online portal reports.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, who died at the age of 99, has always been actively interested in paranormal phenomena, extraterrestrial civilizations, and was fascinated by the appearance of crop circles in different parts of the world.\n\nThe documentary claims that through the groom of Prince Peter Horsley, an agreement was reached on a meeting with a certain mysterious Janus \u2014 alien, which was to take place in an apartment in Chelsea. Janus wanted to give Philip information about saving the planet.\n\n\"The meeting never took place, and most likely this character Janus was actually a Russian spy,\" the film says.\n\nIn addition, historian Richard Felix in the film suggests that the late Queen Elizabeth wanted to study the secret documents of the Vatican.\n\nAccording to Felix, at the headquarters of the Catholic Church in The Vatican has a well-known secret archive where documents are kept, possibly several thousand years old, which describe in detail the origins of Christianity and the like. But there are also claims circulating that they are keeping the truth about the UFO phenomenon.\n\n\"Fifty-three miles of corridors full of secret documents and objects, including alien skulls in the basements of the Vatican and other things. In other words, they are fascinated by aliens,\" the historian said.\n\nHe noted that the The Vatican has an observatory in Arizona, as well as in the Pope's summer palace in Rome.\n\n\"He has his own cardinal and monsignors appointed to resolve the issue of first contact with extraterrestrials. There is some speculation that they were privy to the landing of UFOs in Sicily during the Second World War ... and, of course, the orange saucer\u2014shaped ship was seen more than once hovering over the Vatican,\" he said.\n\nThe description of the film on the IMDb portal (Internet Movie Database) states that \"the film explores the interest of the British royal family in UFOs and paranormal phenomena since the time of Lord Louis Mountbatten (1900-1979), Prince Philip, and now King Charles. It also explores allegations that Charles flew a UFO in 1975 in Canada.\""

Similar wasp species are known to target flies during their younger, more vulnerable larva and pupa life stages.\n\nThe study, led by Logan Moore during his doctoral studies at Mississippi State University, was published in the journal Nature on September 11. The team of scientists discovered the wasp species by chance while they were collecting fruit flies in their backyards.\n\nIn an interview with Live Science, Moore explained that female S. perlmani use their needle-like ovipositor organ \u2014 the stinger in stinging wasps \u2014 to stab and deposit an egg within a fruit fly's abdomen. The egg then hatches into a tiny wasp larva, which grows inside the fly for about 18 days before leaving its host for dead.\n\n\"It will effectively emerge out of the side of the fly, and just to add an additional layer of horror, the fly will normally remain alive for several hours after that,\" Morre said, explaining the chilling process."

        "article_content": "Microsoft Teams was introduced in 2017 as a unified communication and collaboration platform aimed at helping businesses and organizations get things done. Microsoft leveraged the company\u2019s existing Office software experience and created a unified experience between Teams, Office 365, and Skype for Business. However, as with all software, things don\u2019t always go according to plan. If you\u2019re using Microsoft Teams, sometimes you can run into problems.\n\nWe\u2019re big Teams users here at Digital Trends \u2014 it\u2019s our go-to communication and meeting tool \u2014 and we\u2019ve come across a few issues ourselves over the years. In the event you\u2019re having Microsoft Teams issues, here\u2019s how to fix some of the most common problems.\n\nHow to check if Microsoft Teams is down\n\nLike any software, Microsoft Teams can encounter occasional issues. While these challenges may originate on your end, it\u2019s wise to first investigate any potential difficulties on Microsoft\u2019s part before embarking on extensive troubleshooting.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBegin by visiting the official Microsoft 365 Status page or the associated X/Twitter account dedicated to this purpose. Keep an eye out for any recent tweets related to Microsoft Teams. Microsoft utilizes this platform to announce technical issues, so if there\u2019s a recent notification, your best course of action may be to exercise patience. Additionally, you can monitor the official Microsoft Teams Twitter account or search for the #MicrosoftTeams hashtag. When you observe multiple users reporting problems with Teams, you can relax and wait for Microsoft to resolve the issue.\n\nIf Twitter fails to provide the necessary information, you can resort to a service like Downdetector. In the event of a surge in reported Microsoft Teams issues, take a moment to peruse the comments section, as fellow users may have shared valuable insights. It\u2019s important to note that Microsoft will not report a Teams outage to third-party websites, so you may not receive definitive confirmation here.\n\nLastly, consult your colleagues to inquire if they\u2019ve encountered any Microsoft Teams issues within the past few hours. It\u2019s possible that your entire organization could be facing the same problem.\n\nAssuming that Teams works for almost everyone except you, keep reading to get it fixed.\n\nTeams only shows older messages and threads\n\nIf you aren\u2019t receiving the latest messages from your colleagues, or your feed appears to be frozen in time, we would recommend restarting the application.\n\nTo restart Teams on Windows, look for the Teams icon (a small purple and white icon of two people and a T) in the taskbar in the lower-right of your screen \u2014 you may need to click a little arrow to expand the taskbar. Once the icon is located, right-click it and select Quit. On MacOS, right-click the Teams icon in your Dock, then choose Quit. Now, reopen the application to see if your problem has been solved.\n\nIf you are still having Microsoft Teams issues when it comes to loading the latest messages, check your internet connection to ensure everything else is working fine. You can do this by simply opening your browser and heading to a reliable website you often visit. Check a few different websites to make sure your internet is not disconnected or slow. You can also verify it by running a test on Speedtest.net.\n\nMicrosoft Teams also has a web version that you can try if the app is misbehaving. Sign in at https://teams.microsoft.com/ and check if your messages are loading there.\n\nMicrophone or webcam problems\n\nIf you\u2019re having Microsoft Teams issues with your webcam or microphone, begin by ensuring that your hardware is plugged in correctly. Next, make sure that during a meeting, your microphone and webcam are enabled \u2014 you will see toggle switches for these options when you join a new call.\n\nIf other applications can see your webcam and microphone but Teams cannot, you may need to allow permissions for Teams. To alter permissions on Windows, click the Windows search bar (located within the left side of the taskbar) then type in \u201cWebcam.\u201d After selecting Choose which apps can access your camera, make sure the toggle underneath Let desktop apps access your camera is switched to the On position. Then scroll past the toggle to make sure that Teams and the browser apps you use to access the web version of Teams are included in the list of apps that have been granted this permission.\n\nTo alter Teams\u2019 permissions on MacOS, click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the screen, then choose System Preferences. From here, select Security & privacy, then Camera \u2014 you may need to click the Lock icon to make changes here. Ensure that Teams or the web browser you are using to access Teams is enabled on the right.\n\nIf that didn\u2019t help, make sure you have the latest Windows or MacOS update available as well as the latest version of Teams itself. Updating Teams is easy \u2014 select the Three dots icon to the left of your Profile icon in the top-right corner of the app and choose Check for updates. While you\u2019re at it, check if your internet connection is working fine by visiting a few of your favorite websites.\n\nYou should also verify whether your camera is not currently being used by another app, such as Skype or WhatsApp. You can do this by closing all the other messenger apps that could possibly take control of your camera.\n\nIf you\u2019re using Teams in English, you can make a test call to check whether everything is fine on your end \u2014 after all, it could be an issue with Teams. At the top-right of Teams, select the Three dots icon, then choose Settings > Devices. Under Sync device buttons, select Make a test call.\n\nUnable to create a new team in Microsoft Teams\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to create a new team in Microsoft Teams but encountering difficulties, it\u2019s advisable to consult your system administrator. Some companies and organizations have the capability to restrict individuals from forming new groups or teams. To address this issue, contact your IT department for additional guidance and support.\n\nAssuming you are the one in charge of creating new teams for your organization, you may have reached the limit for teams assigned by Microsoft to your company account. There might also be an issue with administrator permissions given to your user account. In both cases, you should reach out to the vendor who manages your organization\u2019s Microsoft Teams access.\n\nUnable to establish a connection to Microsoft Teams\n\nIf you\u2019re having problems accessing Teams, make sure that your Mac, PC, or mobile device can access other networks or internet content. If your computer is connected to the internet but Teams is still inaccessible, the service might be down. Check with Microsoft\u2019s Support page to see if they are having problems with the Teams service.\n\nMost of the fixes we\u2019ve gone over above are also helpful here. Update your Microsoft Teams app to the latest version by selecting the Three dots icon to the left of your Profile photo in the top-right corner of the app. Select Check for updates and let the software do its job.\n\nAssuming the Microsoft Teams app doesn\u2019t work for you, you can always try to access it through the web client on the official Microsoft website.\n\nTeams is stuck in a login loop in Microsoft Edge\n\nIf you are using Microsoft Edge, or the older Internet Explorer (which is officially retired, so it\u2019s time for a change!), you may find that your login screen for Teams is stuck in a loop. This is likely because your organization uses the Trusted Sites option and hasn\u2019t enabled Microsoft Teams.\n\nYou can follow these steps to allow Teams. If you are blocked from the process, you may need to contact your system administrator or IT help desk for further assistance.\n\nStep 1: Open Microsoft Edge.\n\nStep 2: Go to Settings, then select Cookies and site permissions.\n\nStep 3: Next, select Manage and delete cookies and site data.\n\nStep 4: Enable Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended).\n\nStep 5: Then ensure that Block third-party cookies is off. If you need to keep this setting on instead for some reason, go to step 6.\n\nStep 6: Under the Allow section, add the following sites:\n\n[*.]microsoft.com\n\n[*.]microsoftonline.com\n\n[*.]teams.skype.com\n\n[*.]teams.microsoft.com\n\n[*.]sfbassets.com\n\n[*.]skypeforbusiness.com\n\nCan\u2019t access a Microsoft Teams OneNote notebook\n\nIf your document libraries contain more than 5,000 OneNote items, Teams may deliver this message: \u201cOne or more of the document libraries on the user or group\u2019s OneDrive contains more than 5,000 OneNote items (notebooks, sections, section groups) and cannot be queried using the API. Please make sure that none of the user or group\u2019s document libraries contains more than 5,000 OneNote items. Please follow the link below for instructions on how to remedy this situation.\u201d\n\nTo correct this error, you will need to reduce the number of items in OneNote below 5,000. Microsoft provides this OneNote API Diagnostic tool for counting the number of items in a specific document library, which may assist you at this time.\n\nTeams won\u2019t allow you to log in to the service\n\nIf you are having Microsoft Teams issues logging in to the service, begin by ensuring that you are entering the correct login information. You may receive one of the error codes listed below if you are entering the accurate information but are still being denied access. Contact your IT department with the given error code, as the issue will need to be removed by your system administrator.\n\nCommon Microsoft Teams login error codes:\n\n0xCAA20003: Authorization problem \u2014 make sure the date and time are configured correctly.\n\nAuthorization problem \u2014 make sure the date and time are configured correctly. 0xCAA82EE2: Request timed out \u2014 confirm you\u2019re connected to the internet and firewalls aren\u2019t blocking access to the service.\n\nRequest timed out \u2014 confirm you\u2019re connected to the internet and firewalls aren\u2019t blocking access to the service. 0xCAA82EE7: Server not resolved \u2014 confirm you are connected to the internet and firewalls aren\u2019t stopping access to the service.\n\nServer not resolved \u2014 confirm you are connected to the internet and firewalls aren\u2019t stopping access to the service. 0xCAA20004: Request requires approval \u2014 make sure that the organization is complying with Azure Active Directory configuration policies.\n\nRequest requires approval \u2014 make sure that the organization is complying with Azure Active Directory configuration policies. 0xCAA90018: Incorrect credentials \u2014 you are using the wrong credentials to sign in to Microsoft 365 services.\n\nIncorrect credentials \u2014 you are using the wrong credentials to sign in to Microsoft 365 services. 0xCAA5004B: The Microsoft Teams app has encountered an unexpected issue \u2014 wait a few minutes and try again or use the web version. (Our comparison of Microsoft Teams\u2019 online web app vs the desktop app highlights the differences.)\n\nNotifications are not being delivered to your desktop\n\nIf you\u2019re not receiving notifications from Microsoft Teams anymore, it may not be a glitch \u2014 the permissions just might\u2019ve changed. Begin by checking that the Teams app has the correct settings enabled.\n\nOpen the Microsoft Teams app, select the Three-dots icon next to your Profile photo in the top right, and choose Settings. Next, select the Notifications option. Make sure that your notifications are still on and that the permissions are what they should be. If they aren\u2019t, adjust these settings as necessary.\n\nUnable to send a message in Skype for Business\n\nWhen attempting to send a message to an individual Skype for Business account, encountering an operation failure may be attributed to two common causes. First, it\u2019s essential to verify that the recipient\u2019s status is configured as \u201cAvailable\u201d or another active state. If both users are indeed available, the second consideration is to ensure that both parties are using Microsoft Teams as the platform for message exchange. The promising aspect is that Microsoft is already cognizant of this issue. However, the less favorable news is that a solution is still in the works.\n\nError message: \u2018We weren\u2019t able to connect. Sign in and we\u2019ll try again.\u2019\n\nOne of the most frustrating Microsoft Teams issues that you might run into with the app is the message, \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to connect. Sign in and we\u2019ll try again.\u201d This notification appears when you leave the Teams app idle for too long. If you don\u2019t notice when this banner notification pops up, you could miss out on any announcements and meeting prompts until you address it.\n\nSadly, restarting the app isn\u2019t enough to fix the problem, but you can typically solve it by resetting the app\u2019s cache. To do this, simply follow the below steps:\n\nStep 1: Completely quit the Teams application by right-clicking the Teams icon in the system tray (next to the clock on your taskbar) and selecting Quit.\n\nStep 2: Right-click the Start menu icon and click Run.\n\nStep 3: In the Run window that appears, type %AppData%/Microsoft. Click OK.\n\nStep 4: In the new window, right-click the Teams folder and select Rename.\n\nStep 5: Type in TeamsBackup, (or any other name you may want) then hit Enter on your keyboard.\n\nOpen the Teams app and try to use it once more. You\u2019ll likely have to reconfigure your settings from the beginning, but you should finally have this issue resolved.\n\nMicrosoft Teams keeps on freezing or shutting down\n\nOne of the most common Microsoft Teams issues is that the app will sometimes randomly freeze or shut down. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take to fix this nuisance.\n\nRestart the app by shutting it down fully. On Windows, you can do this by accessing the Task manager through the following combination of keys: Ctrl + Alt + Del. Navigate to Task manager > Microsoft Teams > End task. On MacOS, use this key combination instead: Command + Option + Esc. This will force quit the app. A Force Quit window should appear; choose Microsoft Teams, then select the Force Quit button.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re running the latest version of Microsoft Teams before you delve into this any further. Simply select the Three dots icon to the left of your Profile photo when the app is currently working. You\u2019ll find it in the top-right corner of Teams. Next, select Check for updates and download the newest version.\n\nYou can also troubleshoot or repair the app via Windows itself, but this depends on your level of access when it comes to administration rights. Start by trying to access the Settings by tapping the Windows + I keys simultaneously on your keyboard. Navigate to System > Troubleshoot > Other trouble-shooters. Scroll down until you see Windows Store apps and then click Run.\n\nAlternatively, from Windows settings, click on Apps and then Apps & features. Once you find Microsoft Teams, click on Advanced options and repair the app. This should not affect your data.\n\nOne last possible fix: it might be worth uninstalling and then reinstalling Microsoft Teams.\n\nError message: \u2018You\u2019re missing out!\u2019\n\nHave you received an odd error message when trying to sign in to Teams? This problem affects users who run Microsoft 365 Education. Upon trying to sign in, you may encounter an error that says: \u201cYou\u2019re missing out! Ask your admin to enable Microsoft Teams for <CompanyName>.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft itself is aware of this problem and notes that in Microsoft 365 Education, Teams is not \u201cenabled by default.\u201d This means that your school\u2019s system administrator will have to enable it manually.\n\n\u2018Are you still there?\u2019 message appears\n\nIf you\u2019re using the web version of Teams, you may have been dealing with this fairly annoying problem \u2014 frequent pop-ups that ask if you\u2019re still there and active. Microsoft allegedly added this functionality to reduce unnecessary sync time. After all, if you\u2019re not actively using the app, there is no need to refresh your other tabs for you. Unfortunately, this can still pop up in the middle of a meeting and log you out for no reason.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid this would be to use the proper Microsoft Teams software as opposed to the web version. Alternatively, try to minimize the amount of Teams tabs you\u2019re running at any given time, and if you can\u2019t, then try to mix up the web version and the app. Use the latter for meetings and other important things that you can\u2019t afford to be logged out of.\n\nTeams audio not working with Android Auto\n\nAndroid Auto has a feature that allows you to tap into a web conference so you can watch and listen to it while you are driving, a great time saver when commuting. But Microsoft Teams users have encountered a bug that prevents the audio from working, so all they get is silence.\n\nGoogle investigated this issue in 2022 and reported that any remaining issue is entirely on Microsoft\u2019s side. Microsoft has yet to announce any patches addressing it specifically.\n\nIf you\u2019re having this issue, update to the latest version of Android Auto. Some users have said that this fixed the problem for them. Otherwise, switch to audio from your phone, or audio via your car\u2019s Bluetooth connection instead.\n\nTeams opens on startup\n\nIf your boss expects you to respond to any message, Teams starting right away whenever you turn on your computer could be a big, annoying issue. Here\u2019s how to stop Teams from opening on startup:\n\nStep 1: Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open up your Task Manager.\n\nStep 2: Tap the \u2018Startup\u2019 tap at the top.\n\nStep 3: Right click the Microsoft Teams app and select \u2018Disable\u2019.\n\nAfter making this switch, don\u2019t forget to turn on your Teams when you start work or your boss might consider you absent.\n\nNone of the above solutions fixed your problem?\n\nMicrosoft Teams issues can certainly get annoying, and if nothing helps, it\u2019s time to escalate. While Microsoft Teams has its fair share of bugs that you\u2019ll regularly experience, having more consistent problems might be something you need to get your company\u2019s IT administrator to solve.\n\nIf you happen to be the administrator for your company, you can read through Microsoft\u2019s support documentation, which is made readily available to anyone in need of assistance. If none of the troubleshooting options from the doc work for you, you\u2019ll have to contact Microsoft\u2019s technical team for hands-on help with your specific issue.\n\nDo you use Zoom too? If you ever run into any Zoom problems, there are ways to fix them too."
