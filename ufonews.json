AREA 51 is a highly classified US Air Force installation located in the state of Nevada. Its official name is the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), and it is primarily used to develop and test experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The base has sparked various conspiracy theories, particularly those involving alien technology and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), owing to its secrecy and the government's early denial of its existence. Area 51 is located in southern Nevada, about 83 miles (133 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. It was established in the early 1950s and initially used for testing the U-2 spy plane during the Cold War. The US government did not formally recognise the existence of Area 51 until 2013 when the CIA published declassified papers. The site has been linked to a variety of conspiracy theories about extraterrestrial life and superior technology. Popular culture has contributed to the base's mystery, frequently portraying it as a hub for UFO encounters and alien research. Area 51 is surrounded by restricted airspace, making unauthorised access prohibited. The surrounding areas are monitored, and warning signs indicate the base's restricted status. The base is notable for testing military aircraft, such as stealth bombers and spy planes, as well as classified technology.\n\nBut he acknowledged that countries like China are starting to develop their own technologies.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, they\u2019ve moved on from copying to creating their own designs.\u201d\n\nAs the investigation continues and the mystery of Area 51 persists, the FBI raid has only intensified the speculation surrounding the base.\n\nArnu remains undeterred in his mission to uncover the truth, despite the challenges he faces from authorities.\n\nIn 2022, his home was raided by the FBI and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n\nAuthorities dispatched 25 agents to search his property, seizing computers, hard drives, and other electronic devices.\n\nThis operation was part of an investigation into potential breaches of national security, leaving many to wonder what sensitive information the researcher may have possessed.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t fully understand why it happened. I\u2019ve always worked within legal limits,\u201d Arnu said.\n\nDespite the challenges Arnu has faced, including the recent FBI raid, he remains determined to keep Area 51 research alive.\n\nTo ensure the next generation of enthusiasts continues exploring the mysteries of the base, he launched a YouTube channel dedicated to educating people about Area 51.\n\n\u201cI hope that my legacy inspires others to dig deeper into these mysteries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe hopes to equip younger researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to investigate the site.\n\nArnu\u2019s goal is to present factual, verifiable information, in contrast to the many conspiracy theories that flood the internet.\n\nHe said: \"There\u2019s all these conspiracy websites, but what my website wants to be - and what my YouTube channel wants to be - is just to show people the real deal.\n\n\"I want people to come out here, form their own opinions, and do their own research.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Arnu hopes that his work will inspire others to continue the search for truth at Area 51 while providing guidance on how to legally and safely pursue their curiosity.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can come out here with binoculars, look at the base, no problem, but don\u2019t step across the border.\"\n\nWith new technologies potentially being developed behind its closed gates and a long history of secrecy, the base remains a hotbed of speculation.\n\nArnu\u2019s dedication to uncovering the mysteries and educating others will likely keep the spotlight on this enigmatic site for years to come.\n\nWhether it\u2019s alien technology, experimental aircraft, or classified military systems, the world is still eager to know what really lies within Area 51."

        "article_content": "Remember Tamagotchi, the handheld digital pet that took the world by storm in the early 2000s? If you\u2019re as old as me, you will probably relate to it. If you can\u2019t, well, you\u2019re in for quite the ride. Casio has now launched a modern take on the Tamagotchi, its AI-powered robot pet called Moflin, and it costs 59,400 yen (roughly $400).\n\nThis is not the first we are hearing of this furry little robot dog though. This owl-crossed-with-a-hamster AI pet appeared for the first time at CES 2021, courtesy of a partnership between Casio and Vanguard Industries. Fast forward to now, and it\u2019s finally up for pre-orders in Japan.\n\nAs per the description on Casio\u2019s website, \u201cMoflin is a buddy who has a heart like a living creature and gives energy to the heart. It is an AI pet (communication robot) that grows emotions by interacting with people.\u201d\n\nImage Courtesy: Casio\n\nSimply put, the AI model powering the robot learns the user\u2019s behaviors and environment to reciprocate better to every action. It does so with the help of movements and sounds, alongside an app called MofLife that displays its mood. However, the app is not available yet and is scheduled to be released on November 7, right when Moflin will start shipping. Oh, it apparently likes to cuddle as well, a lot.\n\nSo, on the first day, Casio Moflin\u2019s emotions will start kicking in, from the looks of it. At around the 25-day mark, Casio states that these very emotions become richer as the AI pet starts getting more used to the user. Finally, post 50 days, the AI pet reaches maturity, displaying the extremes of each emotion well. While the movements and sounds may not help much to display Moflin\u2019s mood, the app will detail it all.\n\nMoreover, Moflin is also supposed to identify your voice as you interact more with it. So, it will instantly react to your voice as compared to those voices that don\u2019t interact with it as much.\n\nHowever, as with all things electronic, the adorable Casio Moflin also has a battery life. On a single charge, the fluffy robot can last you around 5 hours. Then, all you have to do is place your pet on its charging bed for around 3.5 hours, and it will go right back to being your emotional support animal.\n\nWhile the very concept of an AI pet, especially one that\u2019s this adorable, is wonderful and everything, I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. A busy part of me simply wants to take it home for I won\u2019t feel as bad about having to leave it to go to work. Meanwhile, the other part of me still can\u2019t fathom the fact that I\u2019m having to rely on a robot for emotional support. It\u2019s a rather strange world we live in.\n\nI\u2019ll only be able to say more if and when I test it out. For now, the AI companion is limited to Japan, and I\u2019m hoping it reaches our corner of the world too. What about you? What do you think of Casio Moflin? Cry your heart out in the comments down below!"

This would make it specific and relevant to users, depending on what the chatbot retains from their chat experience.Remember, Meta AI can recall a long list of personal details like if users are vegan or when their birthday falls or even for situations that are more specific like formal conversations or tone of speaking. Similarly, AI can remember the users\u2019 interests, likes, and enjoyment of all things entertainment.This kind of memory feature can better AI interactions on Meta in terms of giving the best advice and replies which go hand in hand with users\u2019 lifestyles. Hence, the next time you need help with what to eat or what color to wear, this might be your go-to gadget.Experts feel such kinds of customization give rise to natural and engaging conversations, giving the app a more personalized AI assistant. Users will ensure full control over what the chatbot recalls and they can select when to remove and update certain data.For now, the feature is still under development but it\u2019s going to be up for grabs in another future update.

I dunno\u2026 maybe I\u2019d have just dreamed a little bigger,\" he says, noting that what he likes about the tool is that \"little Aneesh would still have had to make the movie.\"\n\nIt's an emotive and clever plug for the tech that highlights its potential for human-led storytelling while also excusing the current limited quality of the AI output. I mean, sure, it is good enough for a kid's home movie. I would have been thrilled to have had access to this tech when I was a kid trying to produce Doctor Who episodes in the lunch break at primary school.\n\nBlumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum continues the tone in his statement in Meta's announcement. \u201cArtists are, and forever will be, the lifeblood of our industry,\u201d he says. \"Innovation and tools that can help those artists better tell their stories is something we are always keen to explore, and we welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it\u2019s still in development.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThese are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it\u2019s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they\u2019re best suited for the job.\u201d\n\nAs for Meta, it says Movie Gen will allow creatives to more quickly express ideas and \"explore visual direction, tone and mood.\u201d \u201cWe heard that filmmakers see potential for Movie Gen as a collaborator and thought partner, with its unexpected response to text prompts inspiring new ideas,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also seems that public access to Movie Gen might arrive sooner than we thought. Meta initially said it had no plans to open access \"anytime soon\". But CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Instagram to say Movie Gen would be coming to the platform next year (he made the announcement via a video of himself doing leg presses in different historical eras \u2013 you can see that gem below).\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) A photo posted by on\n\nConnor Hayes, VP of gen AI, has confirmed that timeframe. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not planning to incorporate Movie Gen models into any public products until next year, Meta feels it\u2019s important to have an open and early dialogue with the creative community about how it can be the most useful tool for creativity and ensure its responsible use,\u201d he said.\n\nMeta's collaboration with Blumhouse is another example of how studios are starting to take AI video generation seriously. It comes shortly after Runway entered into a deal to create a bespoke AI model for the film and TV producer Lionsgate.\n\nMeta says Movie Gen can currently create videos of up to 16 seconds in different aspect ratios and audio of up to 45 seconds and that it compares well against Runway, OpenAI's Sora and Kling. If it gets a release, Meta's AI video generator is also likely to compete against Adobe Firefly Video, which is already powering the new Generative Extend in Premiere Pro.\n\nIt's not clear how the model was trained, however. Meta has said that Movie Gen was trained on a \u201ca combination of licensed and publicly available datasets\u201d but hasn't specified which. Meta has access to vast amounts of video data through its products like Instagram and Facebook."

A new study finds that Ceres, which sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, has a crust that\u2019s 90% ice. The discovery of this dirty ice crust has led scientists to believe this giant asteroid used to be a muddy water world. Astronomers have studied Ceres since it was first discovered in 1801. It is both a dwarf planet and the largest asteroid in our solar system. The protoplanet is spherical, with a diameter of approximately 590 miles, and is riddled with craters, volcanoes, and landslides. In 2007, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft to study Ceres. It reached the dwarf planet in 2015 and orbited it until 2018. While examining the rough surface, astronomers ruled out any signs of water existing on the asteroid because of the visible craters all over the surface. The common belief was that Ceres is relatively dry, with less than 30% ice.\n\nHowever, the new study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, argues that scientists might have judged this crater-rich planetoid too soon. The way the craters formed and the planet\u2019s mass suggest an ice-rich environment. Using spectrographic data from the Dawn mission and computer simulations, the researchers noticed that there may be ice in Ceres\u2019s subsurface. Gravity data also showed a density value close to that of impure ice. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s lots of water-ice near Ceres surface, and that it gets gradually less icy as you go deeper and deeper,\u201d says Mike Sori, an assistant professor in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, in a media release. \u201cPeople used to think that if Ceres was very icy, the craters would deform quickly over time, like glaciers flowing on Earth, or like gooey flowing honey. However, we\u2019ve shown through our simulations that ice can be much stronger in conditions on Ceres than previously predicted if you mix in just a little bit of solid rock.\u201d The researchers mapped out a geographical profile of an actual crater from Ceres and used the information to create computer simulations. The computer simulations modeled how the dwarf planet\u2019s craters relax and deform over billions of years. (Credit: Purdue University)\n\nAccording to the authors, the findings suggest Ceres was once a frozen ocean world similar to one of Jupiter\u2019s moons, Europa. The muddy ocean froze over time, creating an icy crust with some trapped rock. The ice-rich crust had found some way to resist crater relaxation. \u201cTo me the exciting part of all this, if we\u2019re right, is that we have a frozen ocean world pretty close to Earth,\u201d adds Sori. \u201cCeres may be a valuable point of comparison for the ocean-hosting icy moons of the outer solar system, like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\u201d The new findings could also warrant a manned space mission to the crater-rich dwarf planet as it may be one of the best chances astronauts have to visit an icy world. \u201cSome of the bright features we see at Ceres\u2019 surface are the remnants of Ceres\u2019 muddy ocean, now mostly or entirely frozen, erupted onto the surface. So we have a place to collect samples from the ocean of an ancient ocean world that is not too difficult to send a spacecraft to,\u201d Sori concludes."

        "article_content": "On October 16 1843, the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton had an epiphany during a walk alongside Dublin's Royal Canal. He was so excited he took out his penknife and carved his discovery right then and there on Broome Bridge.\n\nIt is the most famous graffiti in mathematical history, but it looks rather unassuming:\n\ni \u00b2 = j \u00b2 = k \u00b2 = ijk = \u20131\n\nYet Hamilton's revelation changed the way mathematicians represent information. And this, in turn, made myriad technical applications simpler \u2014 from calculating forces when designing a bridge, an MRI machine or a wind turbine, to programming search engines and orienting a rover on Mars . So, what does this famous graffiti mean?\n\nRotating objects\n\nThe mathematical problem Hamilton was trying to solve was how to represent the relationship between different directions in three-dimensional space. Direction is important in describing forces and velocities, but Hamilton was also interested in 3D rotations.\n\nMathematicians already knew how to represent the position of an object with coordinates such as x, y and z, but figuring out what happened to these coordinates when you rotated the object required complicated spherical geometry. Hamilton wanted a simpler method.\n\nHe was inspired by a remarkable way of representing two-dimensional rotations. The trick was to use what are called \" complex numbers \", which have a \"real\" part and an \" imaginary \" part. The imaginary part is a multiple of the number i, \"the square root of minus one\", which is defined by the equation i \u00b2 = \u20131.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRelated: Imaginary numbers could be needed to describe reality, new studies find\n\nBy the early 1800s several mathematicians, including Jean Argand and John Warren, had discovered that a complex number can be represented by a point on a plane. Warren had also shown it was mathematically quite simple to rotate a line through 90\u00b0 in this new complex plane, like turning a clock hand back from 12.15pm to 12 noon. For this is what happens when you multiply a number by i.\n\nWhen a complex number is represented as a point on a plane, multiplying the number by i amounts to rotating the corresponding line by 90\u00b0 counterclockwise. (Image credit: The Conversation, CC BY\n\nHamilton was mightily impressed by this connection between complex numbers and geometry, and set about trying to do it in three dimensions. He imagined a 3D complex plane, with a second imaginary axis in the direction of a second imaginary number j, perpendicular to the other two axes.\n\nIt took him many arduous months to realize that if he wanted to extend the 2D rotational wizardry of multiplication by i he needed four-dimensional complex numbers, with a third imaginary number, k.\n\nIn this 4D mathematical space, the k-axis would be perpendicular to the other three. Not only would k be defined by k \u00b2 = \u20131, its definition also needed k = ij = \u2013ji. (Combining these two equations for k gives ijk = \u20131.)\n\nPutting all this together gives i \u00b2 = j \u00b2 = k \u00b2 = ijk = \u20131, the revelation that hit Hamilton like a bolt of lightning at Broome Bridge.\n\nQuaternions and vectors\n\nHamilton called his 4D numbers \"quaternions\", and he used them to calculate geometrical rotations in 3D space. This is the kind of rotation used today to move a robot, say, or orient a satellite.\n\nBut most of the practical magic comes into it when you consider just the imaginary part of a quaternion. For this is what Hamilton named a \"vector\".\n\nA vector encodes two kinds of information at once, most famously the magnitude and direction of a spatial quantity such as force, velocity or relative position. For instance, to represent an object's position (x, y, z) relative to the \"origin\" (the zero point of the position axes), Hamilton visualised an arrow pointing from the origin to the object's location. The arrow represents the \"position vector\" x i + y j + z k.\n\nThis vector's \"components\" are the numbers x, y and z \u2014 the distance the arrow extends along each of the three axes. (Other vectors would have different components, depending on their magnitudes and units.)\n\nA vector (r) is like an arrow from the point O to the point with coordinates (x, y, z). (Image credit: The Conversation, CC BY\n\nHalf a century later, the eccentric English telegrapher Oliver Heaviside helped inaugurate modern vector analysis by replacing Hamilton's imaginary framework i, j, k with real unit vectors, i, j, k. But either way, the vector's components stay the same \u2014 and therefore the arrow, and the basic rules for multiplying vectors, remain the same, too.\n\nHamilton defined two ways to multiply vectors together. One produces a number (this is today called the scalar or dot product), and the other produces a vector (known as the vector or cross product). These multiplications crop up today in a multitude of applications, such as the formula for the electromagnetic force that underpins all our electronic devices.\n\nA single mathematical object\n\nUnbeknown to Hamilton, the French mathematician Olinde Rodrigues had come up with a version of these products just three years earlier, in his own work on rotations. But to call Rodrigues' multiplications the products of vectors is hindsight. It is Hamilton who linked the separate components into a single quantity, the vector.\n\nEveryone else, from Isaac Newton to Rodrigues, had no concept of a single mathematical object unifying the components of a position or a force. (Actually, there was one person who had a similar idea: a self-taught German mathematician named Hermann Grassmann, who independently invented a less transparent vectorial system at the same time as Hamilton.)\n\nHamilton also developed a compact notation to make his equations concise and elegant. He used a Greek letter to denote a quaternion or vector, but today, following Heaviside, it is common to use a boldface Latin letter.\n\nThis compact notation changed the way mathematicians represent physical quantities in 3D space.\n\nTake, for example, one of Maxwell's equations relating the electric and magnetic fields:\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2013\u2202B/\u2202t\n\nWith just a handful of symbols (we won't get into the physical meanings of \u2202/\u2202t and \u2207 \u00d7), this shows how an electric field vector (E) spreads through space in response to changes in a magnetic field vector (B).\n\nWithout vector notation, this would be written as three separate equations (one for each component of B and E) \u2014 each one a tangle of coordinates, multiplications and subtractions.\n\nThe expanded form of the equation. As you can see, vector notation makes life much simpler. (Image credit: The Conversation, CC BY\n\nThe power of perseverance\n\nI chose one of Maxwell's equations as an example because the quirky Scot James Clerk Maxwell was the first major physicist to recognise the power of compact vector symbolism. Unfortunately, Hamilton didn't live to see Maxwell's endorsement. But he never gave up his belief in his new way of representing physical quantities.\n\nHamilton's perseverance in the face of mainstream rejection really moved me, when I was researching my book on vectors . He hoped that one day \u2014 \"never mind when\" \u2014 he might be thanked for his discovery, but this was not vanity. It was excitement at the possible applications he envisaged.\n\nA plaque on Dublin's Broome Bridge commemorates Hamilton's flash of insight. (Image credit: Cone83 via Wikimedia, CC BY-SA\n\nHe would be over the moon that vectors are so widely used today, and that they can represent digital as well as physical information. But he'd be especially pleased that in programming rotations, quaternions are still often the best choice \u2014 as NASA and computer graphics programmers know.\n\nIn recognition of Hamilton's achievements, maths buffs retrace his famous walk every October 16 to celebrate Hamilton Day. But we all use the technological fruits of that unassuming graffiti every single day."

The Crimson Tide suffered an upset loss to Vanderbilt, then narrowly escaped with a victory against South Carolina.\n\nThe Volunteers lost on the road against Arkansas before squeaking out a win against Florida last week. Now they arrive Saturday with high playoff stakes and plenty to prove.\n\nDespite the Crimson Tide\u2019s history, the Kalen DeBoer era will be built on offensive success, and, outside of last weekend, the unit has been phenomenal to this point.\n\nVols DL James Pearce Jr. will create some chaos off of the edge to keep Alabama QB Jalen Milroe hemmed in, but it won\u2019t be to the same effect that South Carolina\u2019s Kyle Kennard and Dylan Stewart had last weekend. Expect Alabama to get back to its explosive ways in the passing game."
