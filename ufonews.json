The sightings are then investigated by multiple agencies.\n\nOnce the Pentagon puts together the report, it\u2019s sent to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office for review.\n\nThis year, the AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 from this past year and an additional 272 from 2021-2022 that were not sent. The Pentagon says after being reviewed, the majority of the sightings were found to be ordinary objects.\n\nAs of today, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received over 1,600 UAP reports, 757 of which came to AARO during the period covered by this report. \u201cAARO has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons, birds, drones, satellites and aircraft,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, the Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary.\n\nDuring that press briefing, the head of the AARO acknowledged that there were 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can\u2019t explain. The agency added that all 21 happened near national security sites, were recorded on video, and had multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability recently held its second hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, as they call them."

        "article_content": "The Pentagon has presented its most recent report on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), revealing hundreds of new incidents but without providing conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life. The report includes 757 new incidents, documenting sightings reported between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024, including 272 incidents that occurred between 2021 and 2022 but had not been previously reported.\n\nDuring this period, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) received 757 reports of UAP, with 485 corresponding to incidents occurring within the latest interval. Among these, AARO resolved 118 cases, identifying the phenomena as objects such as balloons (70%), drones (16%), satellites (4%), or birds (2%). Investigators found explanations for nearly 300 of the incidents, often attributing the unidentified objects to misidentifications such as balloons, birds, and satellites, including those from Elon Musk's Starlink network.\n\nHowever, hundreds of other cases remain unexplained. The report's authors stressed that the lack of explanation is often because there is not enough information to draw firm conclusions. \"These are the cases that require significant time, resources, and focus,\" Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said.\n\n\"The vast majority of the reported incidents occurred in airspace,\" with several sightings near military bases and national security facilities. The report specified that, of the sightings it is aware of, 708 occurred in the air, 49 in space, and none at sea. Forty-nine incidents occurred at altitudes estimated to be at least 62 miles (100 kilometers), which is considered space. None of the reported incidents occurred underwater.\n\nThe report underscored that, despite growing public interest and the government's effort to provide transparency about this phenomenon, there are no indications suggesting life outside Earth. Pentagon officials stated that only a very small percentage of reports are potentially anomalous, and none of the cases examined have extraterrestrial origins. Sabrina Singh stated, \"It is important to underscore that, to date, the department has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\"\n\nJon Kosloski noted, \"there are definitely anomalies,\" but emphasized that sufficient signals have not been found to assert the existence of life beyond planet Earth. \"Reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, particularly near national security sites, must be taken seriously and investigated with scientific rigor by the United States government,\" he stated. \"None of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or innovative technologies,\" a sentiment echoed by Singh.\n\nAmong the new instances is a recent near miss involving a commercial plane and a mysterious \"cylindrical object\" near New York, which is still under investigation. According to the report, this was the only case mentioning a possible air safety issue for civilians: \"A commercial crew reported a near miss with a 'cylindrical object' while flying over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York. AARO continues its investigation and analysis of this case.\" No injuries or crashes were reported in any of the incidents investigated by the AARO, and no adverse health effects have been recorded for the observers.\n\nThe publication of the report came a day after U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers requested greater government transparency during a hearing on UAPs, underscoring a culture of suppression and intimidation. During the hearing, members discussed \"the lack of transparency from the DoD and the intelligence community regarding UAP,\" including undisclosed expenditures on related programs and implications for national security.\n\nLawmakers emphasized that the growing number of reports demonstrates the need for the government to maintain a systematic and scientific approach to the investigation of UAPs and to share findings with Americans. Republican Representative Andy Ogles commented, \"There is something out there. The question is: Is it ours, is it someone else's, or is it otherworldly?\" underscoring the mystery surrounding these phenomena.\n\nConcerns were raised that foreign powers may be using advanced technologies or secret aircraft to spy on U.S. military installations, particularly near national security sites. The AARO found no evidence linking the reported activities to a foreign power or advanced technologies, stating: \"There are no indications or confirmation that these activities can be attributed to foreign actors.\" Stay updated with the latest news!

        "article_content": "Google has previously signaled its intention to bring its Gemini AI features to the Google Home app and its Nest smart home devices. Now we're seeing what that looks like. Three key Gemini capabilities are available on Google Home now or arriving soon, and you can test out what the AI can do for you right now.\n\nHere are the three big Gemini changes and how you can use them for home security and general smart home management. It's one of the first examples we've seen of how these massive large language model AIs can affect everyday smart home use, and we can't wait to take a closer look.\n\nNote that these features are available only for English language users, primarily focused on Nest Aware Plus subscribers during the first rollout. They're coming to many more users in time.\n\n1. AI descriptions of what's going on\n\nYou'll need to apply to Google's Public Preview feature to unlock these AI descriptions, so start here. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nTapping into the power of Gemini, Google Home will start providing detailed descriptions along with video clips when a Nest cam or doorbell is activated. That means you don't have to view the video footage directly when you can read a quick description of what Gemini thinks is happening (a man is walking across the street and pauses, etc.).\n\nThis is an opt-in service for those who join Public Preview at this time, so don't expect surprise text pop-ups. We're curious to see how accurate these Gemini descriptions are, as Gemini hasn't been the most reliable conversational AI to this point.\n\nRead more: Best Home Security Cameras of 2024\n\n2. Searching your camera history\n\nGemini can answer questions from your video history, too. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nIf you collect video clips in the Google Home app for an extended period (such as with cloud storage via a Nest Aware subscription), you can now opt into a search function. This isn't any basic search, either. With Gemini, you can ask basic questions to get answers without shuffling through the videos yourself.\n\nOne of Google's simple examples is, \"Was the trash taken to the street yesterday?\" You could also ask the search function about packages or mail deliveries it recently saw, if the dog was taken for a walk yet and any other timely questions.\n\nThis feature is currently rolling out to Nest Aware Plus users, and availability should continue expanding in the coming months.\n\n3. 'Help me create' easy smart home routines\n\nGoogle Home's Automation options are extensive. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nThe \"help me create\" feature, coming soon to the Google Home app, is a more user-friendly option for creating home automations. I'm particularly interested in this feature because setting up home routines (and all the compatibility questions that come with it) is one of the most exhausting parts of managing a smart home.\n\nThis Gemini feature is designed to let you request, in natural language, exactly what you want to happen and then allow Gemini to set it up for you in the Google Home app. So you could say something like, \"I want my door to lock when I leave in the morning,\" or, \"I want the lights to flash when someone rings the doorbell,\" or possibly, \"I want a routine that dims the lights and plays music from my romantic playlist,\" and Gemini will work on putting it all together for you.\n\nNow, to the testmobile!

        "article_content": "Physicists have made a groundbreaking discovery that challenges the traditional understanding of light by demonstrating that laser beams can cast shadows. In an experiment led by Dr. Raphael A. Abrahao from Brookhaven National Laboratory, researchers observed that under specific conditions, one laser beam can block another, effectively creating a visible shadow.\n\n\"Laser light casting a shadow was previously thought impossible since light usually passes through other light without interacting,\" said Dr. Abrahao, according to The Debrief. This counterintuitive finding opens new doors in optics and photonics, prompting scientists to reconsider foundational concepts in physics.\n\nThe idea for the experiment emerged from an informal conversation among scientists. Members of the team noticed that 3D visualization software depicted laser beams casting shadows, sometimes showing them as opaque cylinders that create a shadow in light. This unusual observation sparked a discussion that led to designing an experiment to see if they could create a visible shadow with a laser beam, a phenomenon that challenges foundational concepts in physics.\n\n\"What began as a playful reflection transformed into a fascinating discovery, expanding the understanding of interactions between light and matter,\" as reported by SciencePost. Inspired by numerical simulations where lasers were represented as solid cylinders, the team wanted to test the hypothesis in the laboratory, leading to the creation of a visible shadow with a laser beam.\n\nTo demonstrate this phenomenon, the researchers conducted an experiment using a ruby crystal cube. They shone a green laser beam through the cube while illuminating it perpendicularly with blue light. When the green laser passed through the ruby crystal, it created a region that absorbed more blue light, effectively casting a \"shadow\" shaped exactly like the green laser beam. This shadow was visible to the naked eye, followed the contours of the laser beam, and moved with its source.\n\nThe key to this effect lies in ruby's unusual optical properties. Materials like ruby exhibit nonlinear responses, meaning their interaction with light changes based on the light's intensity. Specifically, the phenomenon relies on a property known as reverse saturation of absorption, where the material absorbs more light at higher intensities rather than becoming more transparent. This counterintuitive behavior is critical to producing the shadow.\n\nWhen the green laser passes through the ruby, its photons excite specific energy levels within the crystal, driving some of the ruby crystal's electrons into an excited state. This excitation alters the crystal's absorption characteristics, selectively blocking portions of the blue illumination beam. As a result, a darker region appears where the green laser had passed, mimicking the shadow of an opaque object.\n\nBy adjusting the power of the green laser, the researchers were able to change the induced resistance to blue light and vary the intensity of the shadow produced. They achieved a maximum contrast of about 22%, comparable to the shadow cast by leaves on a sunny day. \"We experimentally measure the dependence of the contrast of the shadow on the power of the laser beam, finding a maximum of approximately 22%, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day,\" the researchers explained, as reported by The Debrief.\n\nThe researchers developed a theoretical model and showed that it could accurately predict the shadow contrast, quantifying the effect using mathematical models and advanced imaging techniques. Their findings aligned closely with theoretical predictions, solidifying the experimental results and highlighting the robustness of the laser shadow phenomenon. \"Our demonstration of a very counterintuitive optical effect invites us to reconsider our notion of shadow,\" Dr. Abrahao added.\n\nThis discovery has potential real-world applications in the field of optics and laser technologies. According to Dr. Abrahao, \"This discovery expands our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens up new possibilities for utilizing light in ways we hadn't considered before.\" One potential use would be the creation of systems where one laser beam controls another beam. In optical switches or devices requiring precise control of light, such as high-power lasers, this effect could be used to modulate light transmission with great precision.

The ability to cast shadows with laser beams might revolutionize fields like lithography and 3D imaging. \"Potential applications can be envisioned in areas such as optical switching, controllable shade or transmission, control of the opaqueness of light with light, and lithography,\" the researchers added.\n\nThe research team plans to investigate other materials, such as alexandrite, and other laser wavelengths that might produce similar effects, aiming to explore the potential scalability of this phenomenon for industrial applications. Each new material could offer unique properties and unprecedented technological possibilities. They also aim to refine their theoretical models to better understand the underlying physics.\n\nThis breakthrough challenges long-standing assumptions about the nature of light and shadows. While photons\u2014the particles of light\u2014are massless and typically pass through one another without interaction, this experiment shows that light can behave as if it has mass, casting a shadow under specific conditions. As researchers continue pushing the boundaries of optical science, the possibilities for innovation could be limitless.\n\n\"This experiment redefines our understanding of what a shadow is\u2014under the right conditions, laser beams can cast a shadow,\" the researchers concluded. It shows that a phenomenon as familiar as a shadow can still reveal fascinating secrets. This result is also a reminder of the importance of scientific curiosity: what initially seemed to be a simple theoretical question led to a major advance.\n\nThe research has been accepted for publication in Optica and can be found on the pre-publish site arXiv, representing an important contribution to research in the field of optics and light physics.\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with generative AI company Alchemiq"

        "article_content": "Science is the systematic study of the world around us. It involves observation, questioning, understanding, and gathering evidence to make conclusions. Science isn't a subject to be learnt but a way of understanding the world.\n\nTherefore, science education must focus on developing a scientific mindset and capabilities, not merely imparting facts. Today, science education is likened to acquiring facts and figures about already discovered knowledge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStudents are conditioned to view science as a collection of information rather than an active, exploratory process.\n\nTo change this perspective, it is crucial to reimagine the traditional science classroom as a space for exploration, experimentation, and collaboration students actively engage with science as a process of discovery.\n\nThis shift not only enriches their learning experience but also contributes to the broader goals of fostering scientific advancement that is sustainable and beneficial to humanity at large.\n\nFOCUS ON THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE\n\nFocusing on teaching the results of scientific discoveries-such as facts, principles, and applications-while neglecting the process through which these discoveries were made, the learning experience remains incomplete.\n\nThe scientific process-observing, hypothesising, experimenting and validating conclusions-is just as necessary as the knowledge gained. This requires a focus on how to \"do science\". Students must learn to base their conclusions on evidence and remain open to new ideas, just as scientists do.\n\nCOMPETENCY-CENTRIC LEARNING AND ACTIVE LEARNING PEDAGOGIES\n\nScience education should focus on developing competencies leading to abilities like problem-solving, critical thinking, and investigative skills. These abilities are best nurtured through experiential learning and inquiry-based pedagogy, where students actively engage in hands-on exploration rather than passively receiving information.\n\nFrom a young age, students should be encouraged to investigate and explore, with the practice of \"doing\" science driving their learning. This approach supports cognitive development and also cultivates a lifelong habit of inquiry and discovery.\n\nCOMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION\n\nEffective communication is crucial for meaningful science education. Without the ability to express ideas, share findings, and engage in discussions, students miss out on opportunities to deepen their understanding and refine their thinking.\n\nCurrently, science communication in many classrooms is confined to students providing predetermined answers to existing questions, which limits opportunities for collaborative learning.\n\nTo truly enhance the learning experience, students should be encouraged to communicate openly with one another, exchange insights, and collaborate on scientific explorations. Peer learning reinforces key concepts and also sparks new ideas and perspectives.\n\nBy cultivating an environment that values communication and collaboration, we can create a classroom culture where students are more engaged, motivated, and empowered to take an active role in their learning.\n\nINTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO LEARNING\n\nScience in the initial stages of learning has to be presented holistically rather than deepening the boundaries of conveniences created, like physics, chemistry, and biology, among others. An interdisciplinary approach is essential to help students appreciate the beauty and interconnectedness of nature that might otherwise go unnoticed and evolve holistic solutions.\n\nINTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY AND HANDS-ON LEARNING\n\nLeveraging modern technology, students now have access to tools that allow them to visualise and experience scientific concepts in ways that would be impossible through traditional methods. Technology empowers students to learn based on their observations and experiences, fostering a more personalised approach to education. Through a combination of technology, hands-on tools, and real-world applications, learning experiences can be curated to make learning more relevant and meaningful.\n\nSCIENCE LEARNING SPACES\n\nScience classrooms should be reimagined as spaces that encourage students to be active learners rather than just passive recipients of information. Instead of merely verifying facts through traditional experiments, students should be inspired to experiment and engage in hands-on activities that enable exploration.\n\nTraditional verification-based experiments, which require students to reproduce known outcomes, limit their potential for true discovery and creative thinking. To help students gain a better understanding of science, educators should encourage exploration, allowing students to investigate concepts and make their own discoveries.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile research-grade equipment may not be essential, students should have access to materials that allow them to understand scientific concepts at their developmental level, ensuring that learning is both relevant and engaging.\n\nBy making exploration a core component of the learning process, teachers can ignite a lifelong passion for discovery and equip students with the skills to think critically and innovate.\n\nFACILITATING LEARNING, NOT TEACHING\n\nIn this age, where access to information is not a barrier, educators should be trained as facilitators to foster building competencies in students rather than passing on information to them. Encouraging the process of exploration, curating experiences to enhance curiosity and leverage skills in the students, and enabling the process of discovery are essential.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving global learning landscape, the need for transformation in education is more urgent than ever. It is imperative that we make a concerted effort to embrace these changes, ensuring that our educational systems remain relevant, effective, and aligned with the future needs of learners.\n\nOnly through concerted efforts can we bring about a change that will equip future generations to thrive in a dynamic world.\n\nArticle by Vallish Herur, Managing Trustee, Prayoga"
