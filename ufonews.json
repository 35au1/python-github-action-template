        "article_content": "Those curious of life outside our world can find fun Saturday at the Carbondalien Festival, which celebrates the milestone of a mysterious event in Carbondale\u2019s history.\n\nThe Carbondalien Festival marks the 50th anniversary of the infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974. The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

The office said there is no evidence that UAPs are alien in nature.\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s initial public hearing, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has continued to have closed-door hearings on the subject, expressing frustration at the lack of transparency around UAPs.\n\nDelphi murders: Prison psychiatrist describes Allen\u2019s psychosis and treatment\n\nRecent reporting from independent journalist Michael Shellenberger revealed the existence of a whistleblower report that names, for the first time, an alleged Pentagon UAP program: Immaculate Constellation.\n\nThe individual whistleblower in that report has not been identified, and it is not clear if they will be among the witnesses in the upcoming hearing.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "source": "AOL",
        "article_content": "Tech companies continue to roll out new generative AI apps and services. Microsoft (MSFT) has its Copilot for Windows; Apple (AAPL) has Apple Intelligence for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac; Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has Gemini for its apps and Pixel phones; and Meta (META) has Meta AI for its various social media services. But despite all of the hype, I\u2019m still not sold on these apps. At least not yet.\n\nI\u2019ve been using each company\u2019s products for a while now, and while they\u2019ve got some intriguing capabilities, none of them has the kind of features that make me want them to be a part of my daily life. The problem, at least so far, is that much of what these companies have to offer are solutions for niche situations or kitschy demos for what\u2019s to come down the line.\n\nWhether that\u2019s manipulating photos to completely alter their settings, changing an artificial intelligence app\u2019s voice to a celebrity\u2019s voice, or creating generative AI-based emojis, I haven\u2019t come across a single generative AI feature that would convince me to spend $800 on a new phone or PC or make me want to change how I use apps. But there\u2019s potential on the horizon.\n\nLimited uses for most users\n\nIf you\u2019re an Android user, you\u2019ve likely at least tried some of the company\u2019s generative AI capabilities via Google\u2019s Pixel phones or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line of devices. There\u2019s the ability to edit photos to do things like make your 4-year-old appear as though she\u2019s dunking a basketball on a regulation-height hoop or that your dog is driving your car. You can also reimagine your photos to, say, transform a road into a rushing river, or even add objects to them that weren\u2019t there before.\n\nApple also offers photo editing capabilities with its first wave of Apple Intelligence features, though it\u2019s far tamer than Google\u2019s, only allowing you to remove objects from the background of your photos like a person walking behind your subject in a shot or a cup off of a table.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot+PCs are Windows PC with added generative AI features like the company's Copilot chatbot software. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nMeta AI can pull off the same tricks as Google, letting you do things like remove large objects from images or transform the floor in a photo into lava. It\u2019s all a bit of fun to use at first, but unless you\u2019re spending a lot of time posting the perfect shot to Instagram every day, there\u2019s little reason to regularly use these apps. Is that worth buying a new $799 iPhone or $999 for a Surface laptop or changing your routine to use a new piece of software? Not really.\n\nTech companies are also offering features that can summarize large chunks of text, rewrite emails to make them more professional or more casual, and prepare bullet points to help quickly digest the most important parts of a report. These can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to plow through a massive document, but it\u2019s hard to imagine most people taking advantage of such an option in their daily lives.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re the type of person who needs to closely read reports, surveys, or emails for exact details, you\u2019re probably not going to put all of your trust into a generative AI app to get all of the information you require, especially when they\u2019re able to make up information and then present it as though it\u2019s fact.\n\nI find chatting with AI bots helpful at times, but it still hasn\u2019t replaced Google as my go-to for looking up information on the web. And I\u2019m definitely not about to pony up a chunk of change just to chat with a robot.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come\n\nWhile the first slate of generative AI apps and services may not be the generation-defining raft of technologies that tech companies have been hyping them as, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity ahead.\n\nApple plans to continue to update its Apple Intelligence platform throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025, while Google and Microsoft regularly announce new capabilities for their respective consumer generative AI offerings. Meta also continues to debut new options for its own Meta AI service.\n\nBut the real excitement will come as third-party developers begin to push out their own generative AI-enabled apps over the months and years ahead. What we\u2019re getting right now is sort of a test run of what generative AI can do for the average consumer, but third-party developers will likely be the ones that give us the killer apps that make the technology a hit among users.\n\nThink of it like when Apple first launched the App Store. Sure, iPhones were cool and interesting, but sales really took off once Apple allowed third-party developers to start selling apps of their own for its flagship device. If generative AI is going to be as revolutionary a product as the tech industry promises, it\u2019ll be third-party developers that get us there.\n\nNow we just have to wait for them to do their thing.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

These would most likely be powered by Google's Gemini AI chatbot.\n\nYou already get a comprehensive experience from Call Screen as it works today: the caller hears a spoken message asking them to state their business, and you get a text transcript of what they've said. You can then join the call, or send some basic responses \u2013 like \"call me back\" or \"thank you\" \u2013 if you're not available to talk.\n\nThis new upgrade would make those responses more varied and complex, powered by a large language model. It seems that you would still get the option to choose from a selection of responses on the screen, rather than starting from scratch.\n\nGoogle markets Call Screen as a time saver (Image credit: Google)\n\nCall Screen was only just updated last month, with more context-aware quick replies \u2013 ones that aren't just generic responses (so if the call is about an appointment, you might see \"confirm\" or \"cancel\" options, for example).\n\nIt's not clear exactly how the more detailed responses might work, as the 9to5Google team wasn't able to dig out any screenshots or get the feature turned on, but the new answers will most probably be along similar lines to a typical Gemini AI chatbot response.\n\nAnother bunch of Pixel updates \u2013 which Google calls Pixel Drops \u2013 should be announced very soon, though this particular new feature might not be included. Google may need more time to refine the way it works, and it's worth noting that the hidden code already includes the standard disclaimer about the unreliability of AI responses.\n\nGet the best Black Friday deals direct to your inbox, plus news, reviews, and more.

Over the decades, several US outlets have carried stories about ghostly sightings and mysterious night-time noises plaguing the 18th-century building. On the big result day, these stories are circulating again on the internet, and here's what we know about them.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, there are numerous accounts of encounters with former residents, including the founding father and third president, Thomas Jefferson. However, the most famous spirit believed to haunt the White House is that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president.\n\nIn 1946, President Harry S Truman wrote to his wife in a letter that is archived in his presidential library and museum.\n\n\"I jumped up and put on my bathrobe, opened the door, and no one there,\" he wrote. \"Went out and looked up and down the hall, looked in your room and Margie's. Still no one. Went back to bed after locking the doors and there were footsteps in your room whose door I'd left open. Jumped and looked and no one there! The damned place is haunted sure as shootin'. Secret Service said not even a watchman was up here at that hour.\"\n\n\"You and Margie had better come back and protect me before some of these ghosts carry me off.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, the most famous ghost haunting the White House is undoubtedly that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. After his assassination in 1865, Lincoln's ghost reportedly appeared in both the Yellow Oval Room and the Lincoln Bedroom. He is said to have materialised to notable figures, including First Lady Grace Coolidge (wife of President Calvin Coolidge), British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making him the most frequently sighted spirit in the White House.\n\nThe news outlet also reported that residents and staff members have, on various occasions, witnessed the ghost of Abigail Adams, America's second First Lady, hanging laundry or noticed a scent of lavender and damp clothing in the East Room.\n\nIn a 2018 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Jenna Bush Hager shared that she heard 1920s piano music emanating from her room's fireplace. Jenna and her sister Barbara, daughters of President George W. Bush, heard music from the fireplace in the Lincoln Room on two separate occasions: first, 1920s piano music one week, and then opera music the following week, as Jenna later recounted to Hoda Kotb on the Today show.\n\n\"Our phone rang, and I woke up, and all of a sudden we heard like 1920s piano music coming out of our fireplace ... It was like the middle of the night, and you can feel the music out of the fireplace,\" Jenna said on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\".\n\n"

        "article_content": "No-code workflow automation company Creatio has updated its core platform to version 8.2 with (no surprises) a new emphasis on AI. The company which has a particular focus on CRM workflows says that it has engineered a combination of AI and no-code technologies together in a way that avoids what it calls the \u201coverengineered\u201d glut of SaaS applications that perhaps stem from bloated enterprise software stacks that try to offer too many functions or are tough to implement.\n\nThe snappily named Creatio Energy 8.2 replaces static forms and data with conversational prompts for key knowledge worker roles.\n\nAgentic, generative & prescriptive AI\n\n\u201cWith the launch of Energy, Creatio continues to disrupt the business automation landscape with no-code and AI,\u201d said Katherine Kostereva, CEO at Creatio. \u201cThe release combines agentic, generative and prescriptive AI with our no-code tools, empowering business technologists to innovate and optimize operations. Creatio Copilot delivers a unified AI architecture with a robust set of the latest AI capabilities, all configured with no-code tools and ready to use from day one.\u201d\n\nAccording to the September 2024 Forrester report, The Four Agreements of Modern Business Apps, \u201cAI is the force that most clearly marks the upcoming new era of business apps. To survive (and even thrive) in this new era, vendors must reimagine business apps to offer greater streams of value. They must become truly intelligent, dynamic, adaptable, and composable, be powered by cloud platforms, and offer AI, low-code, and marketplaces. \u201c\n\nWhat\u2019s inside Creatio Energy?\n\nInside the toolkit on offer here we find Creatio Copilot, which now offers AI skills i.e. a set of software functions that manifest themselves as blocks so that Copilot can execute specific intelligent tasks that help workers to complete what are generally front office tasks related to services and sales.\n\nWith Creatio\u2019s no-code tools, users can create new AI skills using natural language, with no coding required. The Energy release also adds over 80 new no-code feature enhancements designed to improve no-code productivity. This is alongside unified agentic, generative and prescriptive AI.\n\nAgentic AI (in case the hype cycle has passed you by this year) being AI software agents that can perform specific workplace tasks with little or no human intervention and learn from their experiences with longer-term memory stores to work more effectively over time.\n\nGenerative AI (again, if the hype was somehow missed) functions are of course services that rely on large language models and vector databases to \u201cgenerate\u201d seemingly human-like answers to questions.\n\nPrescriptive AI (which arguably gets rather less love) are functions that rely on machine learning to perform data analytics designed to aid decision-making, but where human oversight is always advised.,\n\nAI Command Center\n\nCreatio Copilot also introduces a new AI Command Center that integrates all three AI types into a single platform. This unified approach provides organizations with the ability to design, deploy and refine AI skills without specialized technical expertise. AI Command Center provides tools that allow administrators to have visibility into AI skills adoption, including the ability to track consumption and users of each AI skill.\n\n\u201cThe new release seamlessly embeds over 20 pre-configured AI skills into sales, marketing and customer service processes, enabling intelligent automation that reduces friction, increases efficiency and enhances customer engagement,\u201d said CEO Kostereva. \u201cThis list will be rapidly evolving as new AI skills will be published rapidly from Creatio and its ecosystem of partners. Energy also adds over 100 new enhancements to CRM processes to improve user experience and drive greater automation.\u201d\n\nCreatio Energy hopes to promote user adoption by including AI as part of its base software license, providing what the firm says is a clear and predictable cost structure for organisations scaling their AI investments."

Unfortunately, this also means that the game has now been delayed until next year.\n\nOriginally set to launch into Early Access later this year, producer and director Hyungjun \"Kjun\" Kim explains in a recent Discord message that inZOI's release has now been delayed to March 28, 2025, instead. He discusses the game's character creator demo and how player feedback has helped shape development following fans' hands-on time with inZOI - and how it has also influenced Krafton's decision to delay Early Access.\n\n\"Your response and feedback made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible,\" writes Kjun, going on to unveil a new launch date. \"This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025.\"\n\ninZOI 'Create a Zoi' Community Creations - YouTube Watch On\n\nKjun apologizes \"that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.\" He compares development to \"raising a human child,\" as both call for \"extra love and care.\" That's how Krafton sees inZOI's journey - \"a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth.\" The studio wants to give the game \"a stronger foundation,\" hence the delay.\n\nI can't lie - after the Life by You debacle and the seemingly never-ending wait for Paralives , I'm a bit worried. As a longtime Sims stan, however, I'll keep holding out hope for a viable competitor with a genuine release. Kjun's words are reassuring at least, as he says Krafton is \"striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation\" and states that the \"goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come.\"\n\nWhile you wait for inZOI, here are 10 games like The Sims 4 to check out right now."
