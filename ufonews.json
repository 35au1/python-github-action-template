Looks like there\u2019s lots of reflection on the side of the vehicle. Not sure if that\u2019s from traffics or what.\"\n\nWhile another thought: \"It was just something tied to the door tied tight to hold it open. If you watch the door starts to close right before it happened.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThen a third argued: \"Not... really. Just actually look at the reflection and you see it actually goes on a lot longer than the 'object'.\n\n\"What likely happened here is the guy got knocked out by something from inside, or got electrocuted and jumped back.\n\n\"And at the exact same time some bug lit up in front of the camera.\"\n\nThe clip has divided the viewers (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\nAdvert\n\nSomeone else also questioned: \"Idk.. the fact that the dog goes immediately towards where the object came from kinda freaks me out. Right after that, the dog does move to the body on the ground but its attention is immediately taken to that area. I wonder if the dog's sniffer picked something up.\"\n\n\"The eagle eyes that spotted the object circling around the cement mixer help confirmed depth and motion,\" a fifth added. \"This is a bug that is flying to the left, then towards the camera then up and over the top right edge of the camera nearly directly at it. Velocity and size of the object increase relatively proportionally to each other.\"\n\nWhatever your opinion, we can surely all agree how weird it is?"

While it\u2019s certainly not the first time someone reported seeing strange flying objects in the sky over San Antonio, it\u2019s an unusually clear video of what folks believe to be a UFO.\n\nA TikTok user shared a video of a mysterious rotating object hovering in the sky off North Alamo Street in Downtown San Antonio. While it appeared metallic or white in the video, the TikTok poster, Justin Delgado, says it nearly blended in with the darkest part of the sky.\n\nWhen the video was shared on Reddit, several commenters noted they\u2019ve been seeing mysterious objects in the sky more frequently as of late. Some said reports or quickly cropping up in New Mexico, Arizona and across the globe while other say they\u2019ve seen suspicious activity in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI seen it all the way from Lacoste,\u201d Reddit user Historical_Wish_7627 commented. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing lots of weird stuff in the sky lately.\u201d\n\nAnother Reddit poster who lives in a rural area outside San Antonio reported seeing what looked like a satellite moving across the sky one night that faded into the night sky. The same poster says they saw a pair of mysterious lights, which they say wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane, hovering over the Alamo City.\n\nOthers were quick to quips on the speculation of aliens visiting San Antonio. In reference to a recent video of a mattress flying down a highway in the city, having dislodged off the back of a fast-moving pickup truck, Reddit users joked the mattress had made it into airspace.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe highway mattress has breached containment,\u201d Reddit user audientix posted, with many responding with their own jokes about the mattress being the sources of the conspiracy. There were plenty of other jokes to be made on the thread without reference to a mattress, though.\n\n\u201cThat was abuela\u2019s chancla after whooping you so hard it was sent into orbit,\u201d Reddit user Chiken_97 wrote."

Moreover, the NotebookLM section that creates the podcast is called an audio overview. Taken together, these two things would seem to indicate a role for Google\u2019s NotebookLM in a future version of Gemini.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nOf all the weird and wonderful uses of AI to arrive in 2024, Google\u2019s NotebookLM remains one of the most captivating. NotebookLM contains a number of products that use AI to help you learn any subject. You feed in your source material as a text file, PDF, or video, and it helps you organize that material. One of the ways it does this is through audio overviews.\n\nAn audio overview is essentially an audio file that takes the form of a podcast show between two hosts who are discussing whatever subject you\u2019ve fed it via PDFs, web pages, or a YouTube video. Listening to two people discuss a subject is a great way to help you learn about it.\n\nWhat makes NotebookLM great is how realistic the podcast sounds. It\u2019s very hard to believe you\u2019re not listening to two real people discussing the subject at hand.\n\nIf Gemini gives you the ability to create audio podcasts from data sources you feed it, then it\u2019s going to be a great way to help you learn about new subjects.\n\nGet the best Black Friday deals direct to your inbox, plus news, reviews, and more.

Just imagine taking a trip around a famous building, like the Vatican, or having Gemini produce a podcast about the building that acts as a guided tour.\n\nThe potential for NotebookLM to integrate with other apps or be useful in new situations is almost unlimited, and we\u2019d expect to see Google coming up with new and interesting ways to use it in the very near future."

            "article_content": "Since 1952, Highway 231 has served as an escape route for Lafayette area residents looking to flee the small city commotion. Heading south an hour from Lafayette, the houses and towns seem to get smaller and the communities more closely knit, guarding themselves among a changing terrain while the sugar maples multiply in number.\n\nCatching a glance at the diverse facades and friendly faces of Mennonite settlements through the passing leaves creates a sense of wonder as to the secrets these dirt roads carry through the hills. And as these answers are kicked up in the dust behind a speeding car, a gem reveals itself around the bend.\n\nNestled between Bellmore and Rockville lies the grounds of what was the Indiana State Sanatorium.\n\nOnly denoted by a sign bearing two blood-red Crusader crosses, the sanatorium, and its legacy exist in local minds as a crossroads of beauty and horror, history and its mistakes. While the people of this area do not mourn its closure, its remains continue to track eyes nonetheless.\n\n\u201cI bought the property for the grounds,\u201d said Gregg Larson. \u201cAnd the old spooky buildings kind of came along when I bought it.\u201d\n\nLarson, a former engineer, acquired the sanatorium grounds during the COVID-19 pandemic. Larson and his coworker Bill Mundo became interested in the history that came with the land and quickly began to work to make it safe for exploration.\n\nWhen Larson purchased the grounds, they had sat abandoned for nearly seven years, and many of the buildings were contaminated by hazardous waste and coal ash.\n\nTo mitigate this, Larson said he reached out to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to conduct a cleaning of the site as it had originally been operated by the state.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you\u2019ve been told, Indiana is one of the most progressive states when it comes to cleaning up pollution \u2026 they clean it up first,\u201d Larson said. \u201cThey spent about seven or eight million dollars cleaning up the site \u2026 they\u2019ve done a really great job so way to go State of Indiana.\u201d\n\nThe cleaning work revealed an extensive network of buildings and tunnels open for exploration.\n\nDespite the clean-up, for Larson and Mundo the work continues. Along with constant maintenance, the two and their other coworkers are converting what used to be the lead doctor\u2019s residence into a bed and breakfast.\n\nAdditionally, they are in the process of fixing the historic dairy barn to host dances for interested university groups, with the Sanatorium being situated equidistant between Purdue University, Indiana University and the University of Illinois.\n\nLarson explained that while the Sanatorium offers bookings for exploration online, the campus still receives trespassers frequently. While Larson doesn\u2019t remember recent trespassers from Purdue, he mentioned that a few Indiana University students had been arrested.\n\nAccording to Mundo, the Sanatorium\u2019s diverse display of architecture and facilities represents three unique phases in its over 100 years of operation.\n\n\u201cThe Indiana State Sanatorium (was founded) in 1908. Tuberculosis was a highly contagious disease that they believed was helped by clean, fresh air,\u201d Mundo said. \u201cSo they founded this hospital slash town in the middle of effectively nowhere on over 600 acres.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a town in the sense they had their own dairy barn, chicken coops, pig styes, slaughterhouse, cheese making, hair salon, church, school, power plant, water treatment center and everything else I can think of,\u201d said Mundo. \u201cA lot of the buildings (were) dormitories for people to live in ... but a lot of the hospital buildings are still around.\u201d\n\nAfter the near eradication of tuberculosis in the 1960s with the advent of more advanced antibacterial techniques, the facility was transferred to private ownership.\n\n\u201cIt reopened after a purchase by a family of accountants from Chicago who\u2019s father and two sons\u2019 middle names were Lee, Alan and Bryant,\u201d Mundo said.\n\nThis began the second era of the Sanatorium as the Lee Alan Bryant Facility. Under the group\u2019s ownership, the facility briefly operated as a large-scale nursing facility. However, the owners encountered issues in patient numbers and were forced to innovate in order to keep their investment profitable.\n\n\u201cSo they found a hospital up north that was a psychiatric ward that was closing and desperately looking for places to place their patients,\u201d Mundo said.\n\nThe Lee Alan Bryant facility agreed to take all the patients from the closing facility, reopening buildings on the campus to serve as psychiatric facilities.\n\n\u201cThe town was unhappy with that,\u201d said Mundo, referencing the third era of the Sanatorium\u2019s operation.\n\n\u201cThat ran until 2011 \u2026 it closed under dubious circumstances,\u201d Mundo said. \u201cThere were tax problems, there were malpractice suits, a lot of wrongful death suits. Their license (to practice) got pulled. The U.S. Marshals came and shut the place down and removed everybody.\u201d\n\nThe evidence of this sudden closure remains evident in the interior of the Sanatorium buildings, left with calendars marking the day it closed. In the cafeteria, lunch trays sit out and wheelchairs remain in halls near made beds, frozen in time.\n\nThrough its three periods of operation, the Sanatorium gained a dark and occasionally tragic reputation.\n\n\u201cThe majority (of the deaths) were tuberculosis deaths,\u201d Mundo said. \u201cNot sensational but significant in volume.\u201d\n\nLarson estimated there to be several thousand deaths that occurred on the grounds over the course of 100 years of operation.\n\n\u201cThe deaths that happened later are much more sensational,\u201d said Mundo, referring to the psychiatric facility. \u201cThere\u2019s murders, suicides; a variety of different types, traumatic failures of utilities, people who escaped and died in the creek or broke into people\u2019s houses, ran out in front of cars on the highway.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatric building, a five-floor building, looms tall above the rest. During its operation, the facility housed mixed male and female patients on the first two floors. The third floor served as housing for female patients who could not be around men, the fourth floor for male patients who could not be around women. The fifth floor housed violent male patients, a common point of intrigue among paranormal investigators.\n\nMundo and Larson noted several separate incidents of suicides that occurred when patients gained access to the roof.\n\nNear what Larson alleges may be a potter\u2019s field, a burial ground for unknown bodies, lies the abandoned power plant. As another point of intrigue for explorers, this building and its steam tunnels were the scene of a murder-suicide.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m a skeptic,\u201d said Mundo, referring to paranormal interest in the grounds. \u201cBut the heebie jeebie factor of the big buildings is off the charts. I go in those buildings at night when I\u2019m getting paid. When I\u2019m not, I\u2019m good, I am excellent.\u201d\n\nAccording to Larson, the sanatorium is booked nearly every night for exploration, a safe activity with the previous deep cleaning of the site. Many explorers come from out of state and from other nations, including well-known paranormal investigative shows from across the world."

Roivant is discontinuing the development of a drug for the lung disease sarcoidosis following negative results from a mid-stage clinical trial.\n\nMoving forward with AI and drug discovery\n\nThe hype bubble of AI-driven drug discovery is getting a little precarious. We recently saw Insilico Medicine fall short on statistically significant efficacy with its AI-designed drug, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals showed no reportable efficacy with its own AI-discovered therapy.\n\nAI\u2019s true potential, Caleb Appleton of Bison Ventures opines in a new First Opinion essay, is in complementing traditional drug discovery, particularly in environments where data are plentiful enough to help answer specific biological questions.\n\n\u201cImprovements in efficiency will be real, but they won\u2019t take the $3 billion it costs to develop a successful drug to $50 million anytime soon,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow the industry reacts in the coming months and years will dictate whether we enter an AI winter.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead more.\n\n5 companies using AI to design small molecule drugs\n\nIn a related piece, STAT\u2019s Brittany Trang this morning highlights five companies in the AI-driven drug discovery space for small molecules.\n\nStartups like Terray Therapeutics and Isomorphic Labs are at the forefront of the field, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars to find new medicines. Interestingly, companies like Schr\u00f6dinger and Iambic are distancing themselves just a touch from labels: \u201cWe don\u2019t think of ourselves as an AI company,\u201d said Fred Manby, chief technical officer at Iambic Therapeutics \u2014 saying instead the company integrates machine learning with automated lab data, synthetic training data generated with computational physics, and Iambic\u2019s platform that \u201cenables us to move so effectively in discovery.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nUpdating the obesity drug tracker. Plus, a new feature\n\nFrom STAT\u2019s Allison DeAngelis: The competition to build better obesity drugs has gotten more intense than ever.\n\nA new quarterly update of STAT\u2019s Obesity Drug Tracker shows there are now close to 50 obesity drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, setting the stage for a news-filled 2025.\n\nLast week, Amgen \u2014 one of the pharma companies angling for a slice of weight loss drug sales \u2014 reported that its therapy MariTide led to an average of roughly 20% weight loss over a year. Boehringer Ingelheim has discontinued the development of an obesity drug targeting neuropeptide Y receptor type 2, while Arrowhead is moving its INHBE program into clinical trials. More startups clamored into the field this last quarter, including Kailera Therapeutics and Pep2Tango Therapeutics.\n\nAll told, the tracker is keeping tabs on roughly 150 drugs in development for weight loss and related conditions, about double the number of compounds than when STAT first published the tracker in fall 2023.\n\nTracking these updates is about to get even easier \u2014 you can register to get notified of updates to STAT\u2019s data tools and industry trackers, including the Obesity Drug Tracker, Generative AI Tracker, and CRISPR Tracker.\n\nGilead expanding in ADCs with Tubulis\n\nGilead Sciences is trying harder in the antibody drug conjugate space \u2014 partnering with Germany-based Tubulis in a deal worth $20 million up front to target solid tumors. Just last month, Gilead withdrew its antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy in bladder cancer, which had been approved in 2021, after a confirmatory trial failed. Trodelvy is still available for other indications, including some advanced breast cancers, and still remains a strong seller for the company.\n\nIn the deal, Gilead said Tubulis will design a topoisomerase I inhibitor-based ADC meant to have address challenges like durability and off-target toxicity issues.\n\nSanofi pours $1 billion into China for insulin plant\n\nSanofi just made its largest investment thus far in China, committing just over $1 billion to build a new insulin manufacturing facility in Beijing. This is Sanofi\u2019s fourth such site in China, which reflects the increasing demand for diabetes treatments for the 140 million adults there who have the disease. Sanofi\u2019s been in China for four decades now, and the company\u2019s plans are to integrate advanced automation, digital management, and sustainability practices into the plant.\n\nThis move comes amid challenges in China for Western pharma, FiercePharma points out, such as AstraZeneca\u2019s compliance woes and reported layoffs at Johnson & Johnson and Merck. Pfizer, meanwhile, has its own $1 billion planned investment in the country to accelerate drug development and support local biotechs.\n\nMore reads"

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s digital age, creating mobile applications seems impossible for many businesses without programming skills. This is especially true for small businesses that may not have the resources to hire developers. However, the rise of no-code platforms has been a game-changer, allowing even those without technical experience to create functional apps for Android and other platforms.\n\nReady to bring your app idea to life? Head over to https://yourmodule.com/ and start building your Android app without writing a single line of code!\n\nWhat Exactly is a No-Code Platform?\n\nA no-code platform is software that enables you to design and develop a mobile application without going through the process of coding. Included are the use of drag and drop, templates and simple tools for editing your app. They are primarily intended for those who want to create something with a good appearance and optimal functionality yet do not possess the time, energy, or know-how of coding.\n\nMobile application development used to be limited to developers and designers, and the processes were rather complicated, time-consuming, and costly. Now with the no-code platforms, one could start designing an application with the same speed and without having to spend huge bucks hiring a developer.\n\nWhy Should You Use a No-Code Platform for Android?\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why you should choose a no-code platform for Android, here are a few reasons that might convince you:\n\nSpeed. With the involvement of a no-code platform, one can create an app and see results faster than traditional app development. It\u2019s not some generational novelty that takes weeks or months for the first application to appear. You can start immediately, while in cases of templates, it can be done even faster.\n\nCost-Effective. Engaging a developer to create a customized app can become quite expensive. No-code platforms provide affordable ways to develop applications, thus allowing you to avoid hiring a developer. Some of these are facilitated with very cheap packages, if not free services, to enable start.\n\nNo Technical Skills Required. With no-code platforms, one does not need any expertise in coding at all. The platform is designed with an extremely user-friendly interface, providing everyone an ability to put an app together. All you need to do is perform just a couple of functions and your app is developed in the least time possible.\n\nHighly Customizable. Although there is no coding involved, you get many options to make your app unique. Most no-code platforms give you an option of customizing the look and feel of the app according to specific needs, thus acquiring a tailor-made app without hiring a developer.\n\nWhere Can You Find the Best Android No-Code Platform?\n\nWhen it comes to Android no-code app platforms, there are many choices out there.

Under this initiative, companies test new products or services in a controlled regulatory environment with an opportunity to scale up their offerings, bring efficiency and devise solutions for new-age problems.\n\nThis security incident comes at a time when cyberattacks are on a rise in the country. In September, general insurance major Star Health & Allied Insurance faced a major data breach, resulting in personal data leakage of millions of its customers online.\n\nHowever, later in October, the alleged hacker claimed that the insurer\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) sold him the data.\n\nSimilarly, in July, one of WazirX\u2019s multisig wallets was attacked, resulting in the loss of digital assets worth over $230 Mn.\n\nState-owned telecommunications company BSNL also suffered two data breaches within 6 months. The incident involved critical data, including international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) numbers, SIM card information, home location register details, DP card data and even snapshots of BSNL\u2019s SOLARIS servers.\n\nAs per a recent report by Zscaler, India now reportedly tops the list for mobile malware attacks globally, surpassing the United States and Canada.\n\n(Note: The story has been updated to include Signzy\u2019s comment)"

In 2025, regarding quality and security as inseparable components of success will become the standard. This shift is fueled by heightened scrutiny from senior executives who recognize that flaws in either area can directly impact a company\u2019s reputation, revenue, and long-term growth. The days of siloed teams are fading. Instead, QA, development, cybersecurity, and product teams will work in tandem\u2014assuring fluid, cross-department engagement and collaboration, with all teams sharing roles and responsibilities to ensure holistic software integrity.\n\nA key driver of this trend is the push to make tools and processes more integrated. Whether it\u2019s enabling cross-team collaboration or ensuring seamless data sharing, businesses are beginning to recognize that fragmented systems slow innovation. High-quality, centralized solutions should become a core value to all companies who want to succeed in 2025. Resources to support this change should be understood as powerful investments that will aggregate value to the entire company, not only to the operational level. Companies that embrace integrated tools and cross-functional workflows will unlock faster time-to-market, elevate customer trust, and cement themselves as a strong competitor in the market."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"
