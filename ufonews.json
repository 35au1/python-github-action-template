            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "C. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nAt CES 2025, the term \u201cAI\u201d was everywhere. All the major brands were pushing it, including Samsung, TCL, Roborock, and more. Even the signage throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center featured AI-generated artwork.\n\nWhen I heard about a new personalized AI wearable at the show called Bee, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the AI fatigue we\u2019ve seen ever since the failures of the Rabbit R1 (which debuted at last year\u2019s CES) and the Humane AI Pin. Those products over-promised and under-delivered, solidifying the idea that most AI hardware probably just needs to be an app.\n\nHonestly, when I walked into the demo suite with the two co-founders of Bee \u2014 Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin \u2014 I thought I was going to see another Humane or Rabbit fiasco. What I got instead was a nuanced, well-thought-out device that just might make personalized AI a real thing.\n\nWhat is the Bee AI wearable?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nBee is a relatively inexpensive wrist wearable, about the same size and shape as a typical fitness tracker. However, it doesn\u2019t have health sensors, a touch screen, or even a display. Instead, it has a single multi-function button and a pair of microphones.\n\nBee is a fitness-tracker-esque wearable that listens to you all day, every day.\n\nThe purpose of Bee is to listen to your voice all day, every day. The device transcribes that audio in real-time on your connected smartphone and then learns from it through a suite of various large language models (LLMs). Bee didn\u2019t list out which ones it specifically uses, but it said it has its own in-house model as well as models from OpenAI and Google.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nWith this constant stream of data, Bee can learn all about you. It knows where you go, what you do, and what you say. It can then use this data for various purposes. For example, you can get a summary of your day, almost like a journal written by someone who\u2019s followed your every move. You can also communicate with a personal chatbot trained on you and you alone, allowing you to ask questions like, \u201cWhat did Maria tell me to wear to the party tonight?\u201d It will scour through your data and give you a response.\n\nThe wearable hardware is incredibly simple and sips on power. It charges with a standard USB-C cable and can last up to seven days. You can wear it on your wrist, as you see in the photos above, but you can also remove the device from the yellow silicon strap and put it into a black shirt clip that comes in the retail box.\n\nWould you wear an AI assistant that listens constantly? 52 votes Yes 33 % No 67 %\n\nWhat can you do with Bee?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nIn the image above, you can see an AI-generated daily summary for Ethan, one of Bee\u2019s co-founders. It says, \u201cFrom finalizing media schedules to coordinating partner meetings, the day was filled with preparations for the journey to CES in Las Vegas.\u201d It shows a map of Ethan\u2019s locations (he traveled from San Francisco to Las Vegas that day) and tells him he had seven conversations.\n\nTapping any one of these bits of info will allow you to dive deeper into the data. In the image below, you can see a much more detailed summary of what Ethan did on January 7, 2025. You can read it if you want (Ethan gave me permission to share it), but I\u2019ll save you the time: it\u2019s AI slop. However, the core idea is quite interesting. Myself, I tend to use Google Calendar to figure out where I\u2019ve been and what I\u2019ve done when I can\u2019t remember a date or location, but this is much better than that.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe chatbot aspect is also fascinating. Remember that Bee learns only from you, so the chatbot will be able to relate your feelings, actions, opinions, and more to whatever you ask it about.\n\nBee creates a personalized AI chatbot that you can ask questions to about, well, you.\n\nAs an example of what I mean, let\u2019s say you want to go out to eat somewhere. You can ask your personal chatbot to find a restaurant in Las Vegas. Instead of just scouring for good places to eat, though, it will look for places you would want to eat. If it knows you\u2019re trying to eat healthier, it will take that into account, as it would if it knows you\u2019re a vegan.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nBee is also an automatic task scheduler; it can create tasks and reminders for you based on your conversations. For example, if you said to someone, \u201cOh yeah, I really want to investigate more into an African vacation,\u201d Bee would automatically create a task for you and schedule it for sometime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, Bee only works with iOS at the moment, but Ethan and co-founder Maria assured me that Android support will be available within the next few weeks.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t this just an app?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this just an app?\u201d question will likely dog every AI startup over the next few years. But Bee actually has a good answer to the question: because your smartphone would run out of battery too quickly.\n\nIn order for Bee to be most effective, it needs to be listening as much as possible. If you did this with your phone or smartwatch, the power draw would simply be too great. The Bee hardware solves this problem by always listening in and then letting your phone worry about the rest.\n\nBee is an app, but it's not just an app because your phone battery would melt if it needed to be on and recording you 24/7.\n\nOf course, the next logical question is: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a smartwatch app?\u201d It does seem a bit incongruous that the Bee wearable needs to exist at all, considering that most people tech-savvy enough for something like this are already wearing a smartwatch or fitness tracker 24/7 anyway.\n\nEthan and Maria explained to me that Bee is already on the Apple Watch. However, Apple makes watchOS so limiting for developers that the app could never fully replicate what the standalone Bee wearable does. The pair told me they hope their eventual planned move to Wear OS will have better results. So, in the future, you might not need the wearable at all.\n\nHowever, for now, to use Bee, you need the wearable. It currently costs $49 for early adopters.\n\nIsn\u2019t Bee a privacy nightmare?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThis was the first question I asked Ethan and Maria. Won\u2019t people who aren\u2019t wearing Bee be pretty upset about being secretly recorded all the time? What do they do about certain states that require at least two parties to sign off on a recording before that recording becomes legal? Where are all the recordings stored? How does it get from Bee to your phone and then to the cloud?\n\nThese are all valid questions, and Bee explained most of them: Bee only records you. Bee has two microphones on it, which helps with audio isolation. You train the software on your own voice, and so it only cares about what you say. You can go even further with this and have it completely ignore all other voices, but that will make all your conversations seem one-sided, which could negatively affect the efficacy of Bee.\n\nBee has two microphones on it, which helps with audio isolation.

The company doesn\u2019t care about your data. Ethan and Maria are selling hardware and a subscription, which is how they plan to earn a profit with Bee. It is not collecting your data because it is not interested in it.\n\nEthan and Maria are selling hardware and a subscription, which is how they plan to earn a profit with Bee. It is not collecting your data because it is not interested in it. Your data is encrypted, regardless. Even if Ethan and Maria changed their minds down the road, your data is encrypted on your phone, so they couldn\u2019t touch it anyway. Additionally, your LLM is encrypted and siloed from all other LLMs on Bee\u2019s servers. Ethan told me that the hope one day is to have Bee exist completely on the edge \u2014 meaning on your devices exclusively and never going to the cloud at all. He pointed out that, six months ago, you couldn\u2019t do any AI stuff on-device, but now you can do quite a bit. Eventually, LLMs will be smaller and more efficient, and everything Bee does will happen on your device alone. However, they don\u2019t want to wait for that day, so they are relying on cloud-based solutions for now.\n\nGranted, Bee\u2019s security promises are just that \u2014 promises. Still, it was nice to hear from both co-founders that privacy was of utmost importance, and they were coming at Bee with the right principles in mind.\n\nHands-on with Bee: I\u2019m excited to give it a shot\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nMaria and Ethan promised to send me a Bee wearable when Android support rolls out. Honestly, I\u2019m excited to give it a shot. I\u2019ve been told by numerous people in my life \u2014 therapists, friends, and family \u2014 that keeping a daily journal is important. But I\u2019ve just never been able to set the time aside to keep one. Having a digital personal assistant who does all the leg work for me is an ideal compromise, allowing me to reflect on my day/week/month without needing to actually keep a journal.\n\nAlso, staying organized and on-task has always been a big part of my work life, and it seems like Bee could be very good at helping me be even better at that.\n\nOnce I have Bee, I\u2019ll do a full review. But in the meantime, let me know in the comments what you think about this new product. If you want to learn more about Bee, check out the Bee website.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Jenny Agutter has hit back at fellow cast members who think the set of Call the Midwife is haunted - but admits she sometimes feels she could be \u201cswallowed up\u201d by the ancient ground in Cornwall.\n\nAnd the veteran actress, 72, believes the BBC drama\u2019s enduring success is down to being rooted in realism - calling out so-called \u201creality\u201d shows as being anything but. Rebecca Gethings, who plays the drama\u2019s Sister Veronica, admitted before Christmas that she has to be accompanied on bathroom breaks during filming on the Surrey set because she finds the corridor to the toilets so spooky.\n\nThe actress also told how, during filming of series 14 last year, the show\u2019s medic took a photo into the darkness having heard a bang. \u201cIf you zoom in, it's a lady in an Edwardian kind of costume, holding what looks to be a pig,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cI've seen the photo and it's pretty compelling.\u201d\n\nImage: BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay) BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay)\n\nBut Jenny, who has been in the drama since it launched in 2012 as head nun Sister Julienne, said she is not convinced. \u201cI don't feel spooked. I've been to much, much spookier places, to tell you the truth,\u201d she told the Mirror. \u201cWhen I'm in Cornwall, which I absolutely love, I'm in a house that's very old.\n\n\"The house doesn't spook me - but what does is a sense that I could turn around and everything might have disappeared. That I'm back in an ancient time where the rocks and the place belong and I don't any longer; that it's all gone. And that's not ghosts or spirits. It's a sense of the ground being so ancient that it can swallow me up.\u201d\n\nJenny and her Swedish husband Johan Tham have lived in Cornwall for more than 30 years. She first visited the county in 1976 to make The Eagle Has Landed alongside Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. Agreeing that when it comes to paranormal activity she is a skeptic, Jenny explained there are usually rational explanations.\n\n\u201cI do think that we have very, very strong imaginations,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe that the sense of time can slip and warp. I think that with the paranormal, there are things that we can't explain - but I don't see them as being ghosts, spirits and those things. We all love a good ghost story. We love to be made to feel, \u2018Oh, there's something else that goes on.\u2019 But I like to actually know what's real and what's not and draw a line somewhere.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage: BBC/Neal Street Productions) BBC/Neal Street Productions) Image: BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston) BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston)\n\nShe said one of the reasons for Call the Midwife\u2019s ongoing success, with a loyal audience of 7million regularly tuning in, was that writer Heidi Thomas always roots her stories in realism. \u201cReality shows are so unreal,\u201d she complained. The people in those are so unreal and the way they look at life is completely unreal. What we have [on Call the Midwife] is something that is dealing with reality, but it heightens it and the drama's there.\u201d\n\nThis current series has seen the action in Poplar move into the 1970s and Jenny, 72, said it felt very different to when the series kicked off, based on the memoir of Jennifer Worth, set in 1957. \u201cIt\u2019s moving forward in time and there's new stories and the new times and new fashions and new music. It's always feeling different, we\u2019re not just repeating things.\u201d\n\nThe actress said that her own memories of 1970 - just as she was signed up as a teen to appear in her breakthrough film Walkabout - are a world apart. \u201cMy memory of 1970 is very, very different,\u201d she said. Walkabout, filmed in South Africa, was released in 1971 and includes a famous scene in which her character swims nude.\n\nIn the upcoming episodes, Sister Julienne is having to battle once again to save Nonnatus House, with officials arguing that nuns delivering babies are no longer relevant, thanks to the NHS. \u201cI don't think she ever questions what they can do. She just questions that they're allowed to do it,\u201d Jenny explained. Realising that she, as a nun, needs help from outside the religious order, she enlists nurse Trixie Franklin (Helen George) to spearhead the campaign to secure Nonnatus\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cShe knows that Trixie is someone who can move and change things and to make it clear to her what the reality is. She still finds it hard that they\u2019re being pushed aside. She's faced all these problems, they've gone through the wars, they've done all these things. And suddenly, when they seem to have a lot, everything's being taken away. So she's very surprised by that.\u201d\n\n- Call the Midwife continues on Sunday, BBC1, 8pm\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."

Their research suggests that the core may have an additional, hidden layer inside it, challenging what scientists have long believed about the planet's structure. This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nChallenging long-standing beliefs\n\nFor decades, Earth has been understood to have four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The inner core, mostly made of iron and nickel, has always been thought to be solid and uniform. However, this new study indicates there could be more to the story.\n\nAlso Read | 230m away from docking- ISRO Spadex satellites are at their closest so far\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSeismic waves reveal new clues\n\nThe team used data from seismic waves\u2014energy waves that travel through the Earth after earthquakes\u2014to study the inner core. They found that these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, suggesting that the inner core might have two layers instead of one. This discovery could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history.\n\nAlso Read | Zuckerberg claims Biden officials would 'scream' to enforce Covid 'censorship' on Facebook\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHints of two cooling events\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings is that the structure of iron inside the inner core might have changed over time. Scientists believe that this could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history. This discovery could explain some inconsistencies seen in earlier models of Earth\u2019s core.\n\nAlso Read | China mulling re-creating \u2018Three Gorges Dam project\u2019 in space. Here is how\n\nData gaps and future research\n\nWhile the results are exciting, the researchers caution that there are still gaps in the data, particularly from polar regions, which could affect the conclusions. Despite this, the study is a major step forward in understanding the mysteries of Earth\u2019s interior."

He was very impressed with OpenAI initially because they were nonprofit. That's when his concern started to arise, and he started questioning himself.\u201d\n\nElon Musk Reshares Interview of Suchir Balaji's Mother, Reacts To Her Shocking Claims\n\nPoornima Rao's interview clip where she is claiming that her son was not happy with OpenAI becoming for-profit, reached Elon Musk as well who shared it on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly known as Twitter). Along with the reshare, he reacted to it with two exclamation marks, \u2018!!\u2019.\n\n\u2018Suchir Balaji Was A Genius\u2019: OpenAI Whistleblower's Mother\n\nIn the same interview, Suchir Balaji's mother talked about how her son was a genius. She said, \u201cWhen he was in high school, for 2 years, every weekend, day and night, he was practicing algorithms. He downloaded data related to machine learning from many different universities. Way before anyone else knew about AI, he was already a champion in machine learning and algorithms. At the age of 11, he started programming. Within 6 months, he used to ask me questions that I could not answer on algorithms.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Acknowledgement from OpenAI of His Contributions\u2019\n\nIn her interview, Suchir Balaji's mother also expressed her sadness because OpenAI never recognised or appreciated her son for his work and contribution to the company, not even after his unfortunate death. She said, \u201cHe did something to fine-tune ChatGPT that made it faster and more efficient. But what bothered him was that there was no recognition for his work until he passed away. Even now, there's no acknowledgement from OpenAI of his contributions. That's very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji's Mother Alleges Murder of Her Son\n\nAmid reports about Suchir Balaji Death Case being a suicide, the 26-year-old boy's mother Poornima Rao has claimed her son's death to be a \u2018cold-blooded murder declared by authorities as suicide\u2019. She further claimed that there was a stark difference between the initial police report and a private autopsy report, that her son's apartment was ransacked and that there were signs of struggle in the bathroom suggesting he was hit and this is not a suicide, but a case of murder.\n\n\u2018This Doesn\u2019t Seems A Suicide': Elon Musk\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has responded to the plea made by the mother of OpenAi Whistleblower Suchir Balaji saying that, \u201cThis doesn't seems a suicide\u201d, in which she called for an FBI investigation following her son's death. Balaji accused the AI gaint of copyright violations, and he was found dead a month after the allegations surfaced.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, his mother, Poornima Ramarao, revealed that they had hired a private investigator and conducted a second autopsy to further investigate the cause of death. According to Ramarao, the private autopsy did not confirm the police's conclusion. In her post, she tagged billionaire Elon Musk and Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom will join the incoming Donald Trump administration and are key ally of president-elect. Mr. Musk, known for his ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, replied to her post, stating, \u201cThis doesn't seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji Case: Controversy Surrounding Indian-American's Death\n\nIndian-American tech researcher Suchir Balaji, 26, who openly criticized the use of copyrighted data in artificial intelligence (AI), was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Balaji, a computer science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, had interned with OpenAI and Scale AI during his college years. He joined OpenAI in 2019 and during his four years at the company, he worked on several projects, including GPT-4 training and improving ChatGPT\u2019s performance. He left OpenAI in August this year, expressing concerns over the potential harm OpenAI could cause. During his tenure, he played a significant role in data collection for OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT. On his personal website, Mr. Balaji elaborated on his concerns, claiming that OpenAI's method of copying data for training its models potentially amounted to copyright infringement.\n\nJust a day before his death, Balaji\u2019s name was mentioned in a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Though details about his involvement remain unclear, his public criticism of the company\u2019s data usage practices likely drew attention to his stance on ethical AI development. Suchir Balaji had accused OpenAI of training its AI models on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorization, a practice he argued was detrimental. \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\" Mr. Balaji said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. The Indian-origin tech professional resigned from OpenAI in October 2023 after nearly four years with the company."

Their research suggests that the core may have an additional, hidden layer inside it, challenging what scientists have long believed about the planet's structure. This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nChallenging long-standing beliefs\n\nFor decades, Earth has been understood to have four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The inner core, mostly made of iron and nickel, has always been thought to be solid and uniform. However, this new study indicates there could be more to the story.\n\nAlso Read | 230m away from docking- ISRO Spadex satellites are at their closest so far\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSeismic waves reveal new clues\n\nThe team used data from seismic waves\u2014energy waves that travel through the Earth after earthquakes\u2014to study the inner core. They found that these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, suggesting that the inner core might have two layers instead of one. This discovery could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history.\n\nAlso Read | Zuckerberg claims Biden officials would 'scream' to enforce Covid 'censorship' on Facebook\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHints of two cooling events\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings is that the structure of iron inside the inner core might have changed over time. Scientists believe that this could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history. This discovery could explain some inconsistencies seen in earlier models of Earth\u2019s core.\n\nAlso Read | China mulling re-creating \u2018Three Gorges Dam project\u2019 in space. Here is how\n\nData gaps and future research\n\nWhile the results are exciting, the researchers caution that there are still gaps in the data, particularly from polar regions, which could affect the conclusions. Despite this, the study is a major step forward in understanding the mysteries of Earth\u2019s interior."

BioWare was at the height of its prowess with regard to storytelling and gameplay.\n\nDespite the game\u2019s age, it still has a long-standing community of fans and creators that give Neverwinter Nights nearly unlimited replayability. In addition to The Wailing Death campaign that comes with the original release of the game, Neverwinter Nights also has two other campaigns: Horde of the Underdark and Shadows of the Undrentide. If none of those tickle your fancy, then the fan-made campaigns might be the place to look. Think about it like a homebrew DnD campaign, except that it\u2019s all programmed for you to play through at your leisure. There are dozens of fan-made campaigns to choose from, many of which are on-par with original Wizards of the Coast content in terms of quality.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAs for what the \u201cmajor performance improvements\u201d listed in the update notes actually are, it isn\u2019t clear. There are several persistent, ongoing fan servers running multiplayer modules that continue to grow and change, even if players aren\u2019t actively involved at the time. The original game was not designed for multi-core processors, so there has always been a risk of bottlenecking during more demanding segments. If this patch allows Neverwinter Nights to make the most of modern hardware, then the modding scene could explode even further.\n\nNeverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Coming Soon\n\nNeverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition was released on Steam in 2018 by Beamdog, and now that same studio has given its blessing to this latest patch. The Enhanced Edition brought several graphical improvements and compatibility with more modern hardware, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 you don\u2019t need a new version to experience the game. The original version of Neverwinter Nights is still a great experience, but be warned: It\u2019s a lot more difficult than you might expect."

            "article_content": "Tomorrow\u2019s workplace will see the proliferation of automation, robots, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Data will go from big to colossal, and video-enabled collaboration will push teams further, faster. Exponential technological growth is changing work as we know it forever; yet key values endure.\n\nAI\u2019s transformative technology will solve complex problems and enhance human capabilities across industries, yet it must be responsibly developed. AI is not only a technology challenge, it\u2019s a leadership opportunity. This is what business schools must focus on every day: How can we best prepare students for responsible leadership? How can we prepare them to lead others into the unknown and to create value and positive change in a world of new driving forces, including AI?\n\nActive learning\n\nThe best preparation for future action is active learning. The Socratic method, complemented by the case study method, builds leadership capacity at a higher and faster rate than other methods of learning. In 2000 BCE, Socrates strolled through Athens\u2019 agora (marketplace) and shared his belief that true wisdom comes not from having all of the answers but in knowing how to ask the right questions. Questions peel away layers of assumption, encourage dialogue, make room for curiosity and innovation and require a strong dose of humility. This timeless posture of learning through questions \u2014 the Socratic Method \u2014 strengthens the muscle of critical thinking and develops the skills of collaboration and communication.\n\nThere are few business schools in the world that use the Socratic method and even fewer that underpin it with the case study method. Here\u2019s how it works: Faculty do not deliver lectures while students take notes. Instead, learners engage in active and experiential learning.\n\nIn the case study method, MBA students examine hundreds of real-life business case studies, replete with challenges and twists. They review these cases with their teams and come to class prepared to express their own formulated ideas and arguments and to apply their knowledge. Ethics, innovation and sustainability are themes woven across the curriculum. Up to 50% of a student\u2019s grade comes from participating in classroom conversation. The faculty orchestrate this symphony of ideas, opinion, debate and feedback, ensuring that the students learn not just from the professor but from each other.\n\nBuild leadership\n\nStudents also evaluate their purpose and articulate their values. They join learning teams and take on leadership positions in student organisations. Student self-governance means that students aren\u2019t just passengers; they are co-pilots. This interactive learning model teaches learners to solve problems with imperfect information, and to speak persuasively and confidently. Putting the learner in the role of the general manager builds leadership capacity and prepares them for the work they will be hired to do: to make recommendations for action.\n\nThe writer is Dean of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business."

            "article_content": "Fundstrat chief investment officer Tom Lee says those who turn a blind eye to Bitcoin likely believe that BTC will eventually plunge all the way down to zero.\n\nIn an interview on the Global Money Talk YouTube channel, Lee says Bitcoin has proven its staying power after over a decade of existence.\n\nHe also notes that it\u2019s now very unlikely for Bitcoin to vanish, given that the incoming Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its support for the largest crypto by market cap.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s probably better to just observe a few things. One is Bitcoin has now been around for 15 years, and there has not been a Bitcoin 2.0. So there\u2019s no crypto 2.0, Bitcoin is the surviving chain.\n\nAnd Bitcoin has become a $2 trillion asset which never in financial history has anything reached $2 trillion and then disappeared. It\u2019s a different argument if it was $100 billion.\n\nThird is the US government [has] reiterated its commitment to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. That\u2019s not bad for the price of Bitcoin. So if someone is watching this and said, \u2018Well, they don\u2019t understand Bitcoin so they decide not to own it.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a catastrophic way to look at markets.\u201d\n\nLee also believes that the macroeconomic backdrop appears to be acting as a tailwind for risk assets like stocks and crypto, at least for the first half of the year. He adds that his bullish stance is supported by jittery market sentiment and the massive amount of cash still waiting in the wings.\n\n\u201cThere is probably room for more positive surprises in the first half because we have an incoming president that\u2019s very pro-business, probably the most pro-business president in modern times. And with, so far, the cabinet selections that the market is very happy with. So that should be providing room for investors to become optimistic which they call \u2018animal spirits.\u2019\n\nAnd the second tailwind is that the Fed is dovish. And what that means is that the central bank is easing. So that\u2019s positive for stocks.\n\nThe third is investors are cautious because almost everyone we talked to thinks valuations are expensive or because we\u2019ve had two good years, [the next year] has to be bad. So we know sentiment is cautious. Usually when people are cautious, then you bet against the caution.\n\nAnd the fourth is that we know mechanically there\u2019s a lot of cash on the sidelines. There\u2019s a lot of firepower \u2013 $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines.\n\nSo I would see this as positive for the first half of [this] year.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "article_content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) in November 2024. So, technically, it was only in the index for a small portion of the year. But it was still, by far, the best-performing Dow stock in 2024 with a 171.2% return, walloping second-place Walmart's 71.9% gain and third-place American Express' 58.4%.\n\nNvidia stock went up a mind-numbing 818.9% between 2023 and 2024, which may lead some investors to question how much further it can run before its valuation gets stretched too thin.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's why the rally in Nvidia stock is somewhat justified, why Nvidia could continue outperforming the market and is worth buying, and some reasons to keep Nvidia on a watchlist for now.\n\nNvidia's momentum knows no bounds\n\nNvidia followed up a rip-roaring 2023 with another incredible year in 2024 -- briefly becoming the most valuable company in the world before Apple reclaimed the title.\n\nNvidia has defended its commanding lead in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market despite a slew of competition. In December, Nvidia announced that its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence (AI) was coming to Amazon Web Services. On Jan. 3, Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion in its current fiscal year to \"build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\" On Jan. 7, Amazon said it plans to spend $11 billion in the U.S. state of Georgia alone on AI infrastructure and cloud technologies.\n\nNvidia could easily beat the market again in 2025 because it continues to innovate, and AI spending is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nNvidia rallied to an all-time high on Monday in response to news that Nvidia customer Hon Hai Precision Industry (also known as Foxconn) is seeing massive growth for AI in cloud and networking. The rally could have also been driven by anticipation of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang giving the keynote address at CES, a major technology conference in Las Vegas. However, Nvidia pulled back 6.2% on Tuesday after Huang's keynote.\n\nNvidia will report its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 26. Analyst consensus estimates call for $2.95 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share and $4.43 in fiscal 2026 earnings per share -- implying year-over-year growth of 50%. So it's worth understanding that there are lofty expectations already baked into Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.6.\n\nThe power of earnings growth\n\nNvidia is by no means a cheap stock based on near-term expectations. But it could grow into its valuation over time if it continues innovating and sees sustained product demand.\n\nNo force is more powerful in the stock market than earnings growth. Earnings growth can justify a premium valuation and make a stock quickly look cheap.\n\nFor example, if Nvidia stock returns 20% per year over the next five years but averages 30% earnings growth in that period, its forward P/E will decline from its current level of around 51 to under 30.\n\nThis lesson demonstrates why excellent earnings growth can make expensive stocks look like a good value for long-term investors. As long as Nvidia continues on its path, it should have no problem outperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). However, if there's a major industrywide slowdown or competition heats up, it wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia sell off.\n\nA person sitting at a table, looking calmly at a laptop computer.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRapidly growing earnings sets Nvidia apart\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry. Earnings are soaring, and so is the stock price. But for earnings to keep going up, Nvidia has to lap its difficult comps. That could become challenging if the investment cycle enters a slowdown or less expensive alternatives, like chips made by Advanced Micro Devices, eat away at some of Nvidia's market share.\n\nThe buy case for Nvidia is quite simple. If you believe the company will remain a long-term winner in AI, the stock is worth buying and holding. But it's worth understanding that Nvidia's sky-high operating margins, market share, and growth rate may not be sustainable over the long term.\n\nEven if revenue growth remains strong, Nvidia's earnings growth could fall if its margins come down. Nvidia's trailing 12-month gross margin is 75.9%, and its operating margin is 62.7% -- meaning it's converting the majority of sales into operating income, a truly unbelievable feat.\n\nBut earnings growth can slow down\n\nNvidia's high profitability comes from the ability to set premium prices for its products, which deep-pocketed customers willingly pay to further their AI ambitions. If those customers aren't able to monetize AI as well as they hoped, they could slow their pace of AI spending, which would affect Nvidia even if it continues cranking out great products. Put another way, Nvidia needs to continue making great products, and its customers must be able to afford those products. For example, companies can spend money on Nvidia computing hardware for self-driving vehicles, but those vehicles must sell to justify future order volumes.\n\nJust as the buy case for Nvidia is fairly straightforward, I think the reasons to keep it on a watchlist are also simple. Some investors may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to how Nvidia handles mounting competition, how it performs in an industry slowdown, and if it can continue to be the undisputed industry leader.\n\nNvidia has been at the top of its game, uninterrupted, for a couple of years now. If it keeps it up, it's easy to see how Nvidia could become the most valuable company in the world and maintain position. But it's also possible that spending on AI could flatline for a few years, or that some unforeseen challenges will appear that hinder Nvidia's ability to grow.\n\nApproaching an investment in Nvidia\n\nNvidia is priced for strong and sustained growth, but not for perfection. Despite the run-up, it doesn't have a nose-bleed valuation.

            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

By merging digital capabilities with biology, these fields are unlocking the secrets of life and reshaping it in profound ways. Among the leaders in this transformative era is the biotech company Shift Bioscience, which recently secured $16 million in seed funding to support its groundbreaking research on reversing aging. Utilizing generative AI, the company simulates human cells to identify genes capable of rejuvenation, paving the way for treatments aimed at slowing or even reversing the effects of aging.\n\nHowever, this scientific leap forward is intertwined with deeper complexities concerning humanity\u2019s understanding of existence and the boundaries of scientific intervention. Genomics, one of the most intricate sciences, deciphers the DNA code that holds information about our biological history, present, and future. Dubbed the \u201celixir of life,\u201d genomics enables humans to correct genetic mutations that impact health. Yet, it also raises thorny ethical questions about the limits of genetic modification and its implications for human nature itself.\n\nAI excels in tackling the challenges inherent in this complexity. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, precise genetic modifications can now correct hereditary errors responsible for various diseases. Advanced technologies such as DeepCRISPR and CRISPR-Net enhance the accuracy of these modifications and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. AI not only identifies target genes but also designs guide RNA sequences to ensure precise execution of genetic edits. These extraordinary capabilities are redefining our relationship with our bodies, making it possible to predict future diseases, prevent them, and even improve genetic traits before future generations are born.\n\nDespite these advancements, the scientific revolution is not without its challenges and risks. While scientists pursue the dream of biological immortality, privacy concerns emerge as one of the most significant threats. Genetic data analysis, also known as genetic fingerprinting, reveals the biological secrets of individuals, which could potentially be exploited to develop biological weapons or invade personal privacy. Without robust legal and ethical frameworks, these technologies become a double-edged sword\u2014either enhancing human well-being or exposing humanity to exploitation.\n\nBeyond ethical risks, humanity faces new challenges related to increasing reliance on technology. A notable example is the impact of modern devices like GPS systems on the human brain. Studies show that drivers who rely on these systems experience shrinkage in brain regions responsible for navigation, while those who rely on natural skills maintain the health of these areas. This \u201ctechnological colonization,\u201d which threatens to undermine human capabilities, raises questions about the price we pay for technological progress.\n\nThe ongoing scientific revolution is not merely about technical achievements; it is a test of our ethical and human values. Genetic modification and anti-aging technologies may bring biological immortality closer to reality, but the larger question remains: How do we balance scientific ambition with the preservation of human essence? While AI delves into the \u201cbiological library\u201d within our bodies, humanity bears the responsibility of ensuring these innovations serve, rather than dominate, us.\n\nThis complex question gains urgency as scientific progress accelerates, tempting some to prioritize profit or power over ethics. It is crucial to establish regulatory frameworks to govern the use of genetic data and protect it from misuse. Yet, regulations alone are insufficient; societies need a collective awareness of the importance of balancing technological progress with respect for human values.\n\nAs AI and genetic engineering open unprecedented doors to enhancing and prolonging life, the greatest challenge remains ensuring that these innovations reflect our shared aspiration for a more humane and secure future. Technology, with all its potential, is merely a tool; its true value lies in how it is used to serve humanity.\n\nGenomics stands as humanity\u2019s most ambitious and transformative scientific pursuit\u2014a profound journey to decipher the very code of life and reshape its narrative. In unraveling the mysteries of DNA, we are not merely advancing the boundaries of biology; we are fundamentally redefining what it means to be human. This monumental endeavor holds the promise of becoming the ultimate \u201celixir of life,\u201d capable of curing diseases, extending longevity, and enhancing our existence. Yet, it also carries the weight of profound ethical and societal challenges. The true legacy of genomics will be determined by our capacity to wield its power with wisdom, foresight, and responsibility.\n\nThe writer is a researcher specializing in cyber politics, holding a PhD on the topic of \u201cCyberspace and Power Shifts in International Relations.\u201d"
