The previous record was 5.65 inches set on Nov. 1, 1901.\n\nMore flash flooding is possible with more rain and storms in the forecast for Sunday in the Roswell region of eastern New Mexico, the National Weather Service stated.\n\nRoswell, NM flooding rescue efforts\n\nThe New Mexico National Guard said that its troops and other agencies rescued nearly 300 people in the overnight hours, including at least one swift water rope rescue and 38 people who were taken to hospitals.\n\nSearch and rescue efforts continued Sunday morning as water levels remained high in the downtown area, the city of Roswell said in a statement. Flood waters entered many houses and other buildings.\n\nMany vehicles got stuck in flash flood waters with some vehicles swept into the river channel. Other motorists waited to be rescued on top of their vehicles that were covered by water, Roswell authorities reported.\n\nAll roads leading to and from Roswell had been closed due to heavy flooding overnight, New Mexico State Police said.\n\nRescue operations taking place involve the Roswell police and fire departments, the Chaves County Sheriff's Office, county volunteer fire departments and New Mexico State Police and the state's National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard is using light/medium tactical vehicles, known as LMTVs, capable of driving in up to four feet of water to transport residents to safety. There were 57 guardsmen in Roswell as of Sunday morning, the National Guard said in a statement.\n\n\"We feel for the New Mexicans affected by this latest flooding in our state,\" Maj. Gen. Miguel Aguilar, the NM National Guard's adjutant general, said in a statement. \"Because of the previous flooding in Ruidoso, we have the experience and were ready for this. We've worked all night, and continue to work with swift water rescue teams and other partner agencies to help our fellow citizens get to safety.\""

        "article_content": "The Fenton History Center is helping community members get into the Halloween spirit with two Halloween Spirit Tours set for Oct 26.\n\nThe tours are presented and run by Kaycee Colburn, a Fenton board member, artist, paranormal investigator and spiritual intuitive. Colburn comes from a background of working with the paranormal community, including at places such as the Dunkirk Lighthouse, other similar museums to the Fenton, and recreational locations such as the Haunted Hinsdale House.\n\nThe first tour will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Fenton, 67 Washington Street. The cost for the first tour is $30 for members and $35 for non-members. The second tour is a special Halloween tour from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. for adults 18 and up. The cost for the second tour is $40 for members and $45 for non-members. Additionally, guests are encouraged to come in costume for the second tour, which Colburn said helps to bring people into a different mindset.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the paranormal vibe to the area, see if we can trigger any spirits and enhance the experience for the guests,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the Fenton is haunted, we leave that up to the guests and hope to give them a fun experience.\u201d\n\nColburn said the paranormal is something that is very popular these days and the tour can help give people insights into what they might see on television, along with allowing them to choose for themselves if the paranormal is or is not for them. She added that the tour is good for this time of year when the paranormal is already popular and people are looking for Halloween related things to do.\n\n\u201cPeople are already interested in the Fenton on its own and now they can come in the dark and see it in a different light, which gives a cool Halloween feeling,\u201d Colburn said.\n\nColburn encouraged participants to bring a flashlight, dress warmly, and be open minded, saying that there are a lot of theories surrounding the paranormal and that it is not for everyone. She said the tours are for people to come have fun and are very educational about the paranormal.\n\nThe Fenton has done other Spirit Tours throughout the year, and Colburn thought it was something that could possibly be done again next year after having received good responses this year to previous tours. She said some participants have requested the tours be longer or be overnight, which is something she said they are not currently able to do, but that overall there has been a positive response.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out of the house,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else quite like it locally.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Tours are set to offer a safe Halloween, family friendly, fun event to let people learn more about the paranormal and spiritualist movement. Colburn said the tours are a way to bring information in and discuss the paranormal where in today\u2019s society that cannot always happen as it is labeled as creepy.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where the paranormal was not seen as creepy, including right here in Jamestown,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cSo being able to talk about it this way is cool.\u201d\n\nRegistration for both Oct 26 Spirit Tours is available on the Fenton History Center\u2019s website, fentonhistorycenter.org, under the events tab."

        "article_content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Just in time for Halloween, the West Virginia Paranormal Trail has added four new paranormal attractions for participants to visit, the West Virginia Department of Tourism announced Thursday.\n\nThe trail, which launched two weeks ago, is based off of the West Virginia Waterfall Trail that the department has seen do so well. The trail started with only 14 attractions but with the addition they will have 18 spooky attractions for people to see. And since its launch the trail has seen almost 5,000 participants sign up already, and those signatures have come from 39 different states and three different countries.\n\nAnd Lauren Bodnar, Director of Public Relations for the WV Department of Tourism said that this has already helped tourism in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cNot only are people excited about it but there coming here and there traveling around to these different stops,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nAnd the reason that it has garnered so much attention so fast, is because of social media which allows them to reach more people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something a little bit different that we\u2019ve done in the past, it just caught people\u2019s attention, I think,\u201d Bodnar said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s one part but also just our promotion on our social media helps spread the word pretty easily.\u201d\n\nThe four new attractions include the West Virginia Bigfoot Museum in Sutton, Silver Run Tunnel in Cairo, Cryptid Mountain Miniature Golf in Morgantown, and Hempfield Tunnel in Wheeling, however Bodnar says that there are a wide variety of what visitors can expect during the trail.\n\n\u201cThey really range from kind of these haunted tunnels, there\u2019s the insane asylum in Weston, there\u2019s the state penitentiary up north, so really there are a range of different places to visit across the state,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nYou can find the whole list of attractions when you go to the West Virginia Department of Tourism website.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s gained so much participation, Bodnar anticipates that the trail could be something they could keep going.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it\u2019s something that we would consider extending, especially if we get a lot of feedback, that it\u2019s something that people want to keep adding to and that they want to keep checking into,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nBodnar also said that they don\u2019t know every haunted attraction in the state, and they encourage people to go to their website to recommend an attraction.\n\nPeople who are interested in participating in the trail, can go to the Department of Transportation website and sign up for a virtual passport.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll sign up, you\u2019ll put in your name and some of your contact information in a form, and then the passport will be sent directly to your phone either via text or the email that you provided,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nAlthough the trail is related to all things spooky, it is expected to last until the end of this year."

        "article_content": "Discovery of new materials with desired properties is not easy, ask any alchemist. You must take two materials that have the properties that you want and, like making a baby, you must see how to combine them to get exactly the offspring that you want.\n\nMeta (formerly, Facebook), often bashed for cashing-in on data, has now given a meta gift to mankind: tomes of data \u2014 for research into functional (meta) materials.\n\nThe global giant has just released copious amounts of data about behaviour of materials at the atomic level, under its Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) initiative, for free.\n\nThis data can help scientists combine different materials with different desired properties to create something new. Examples of functional materials that can tackle climate change include new catalysts for renewable energy storage, carbon neutral fuels, new sorbents for direct air capture, etc.\n\nCreating such materials is somewhat similar to discovering a drug molecule for disease by trying out different combinations of molecules or making a dish of desired taste, texture and flavour from millions of ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, making meta materials involved playing trial-and-error with millions of data points from thousands of materials. But now, there is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can deliver the goods, however, AI is data hungry.\n\nMeta has provided this food for AI. The OMat24 dataset is a collection of data generated from simulations and calculations on different inorganic materials. This dataset contains information on 118 million atomic structures, whichhas information on three parameters \u2014 total energy (the overall energy of the material\u2019s structure), forces (acting on each atom) and cell stress (indicating how the material could deform under certain conditions.) All this was calculated using \u2018density functional theory\u2019, a quantum mechanics-based method for predicting material properties .\n\n\u201cThe search space of possible materials is enormous and remains a significant challenge for both computational and experimental approaches to material science,\u201d says a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper by scientists at Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group. \u201cIdentifying promising candidates through computational screening with machine learning models offers the potential to dramatically increase the search space and the rate of experimental discovery,\u201d says the paper, written by Luis Borroso-Luque et al.\n\nFAIR scientists took over 400 million core-hours of computing to get the data of 118 million structures labelled with total energy, forces and cell stress. (One CPU core used for one hour is one core-hour.) These parameters give an idea of the stability of materials under given conditions.\n\nNow that there is data on over 118 million atomic structures, one can train an AI model to come up with the best combination of any of them for a desired material."

        "article_content": "Researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) have made a major breakthrough in agricultural biotechnology, focusing on the use of nanotechnology to combat E. coli contamination in rice crops. This discovery, led by Hamidreza Sharifan and his team, offers promising solutions for improving food safety and addressing bioterrorism threats.\n\nThe research centers on the development of advanced methods to detect and mitigate the effects of pathogens, particularly E. coli, which poses a significant threat to global food systems. The team, which includes Daisy Wilson, a Ph.D. student in environmental science and engineering, and Valeria Gonzalez, a senior undergraduate in forensic science, conducted groundbreaking work in biofortification and nanoparticle application to reduce microbial contamination.\n\n\u201cWe got an internship with the Department of Homeland Security as a team,\u201d Wilson told The Prospector, UTEP\u2019s student newspaper. \u201cIt was led by Dr. Sharifan, and he mentored myself and Valeria for the summer.\u201d\n\nThe research focused on the use of zinc oxide and magnesium oxide nanoparticles, which the team found to be highly effective in inhibiting E. coli growth. According to Gonzalez, the nanoparticles disrupted the cell membranes and metabolic processes of the bacteria, outperforming traditional ionic forms like magnesium sulfate and zinc sulfate.\n\n\u201cThese nanoparticles significantly inhibited E. coli growth by disrupting the cell membranes and metabolic processes,\u201d Gonzalez said in an interview with The Prospector. \u201cWe compared these with ionic forms like magnesium sulfate and zinc sulfate and found that the nanoparticles outperformed the ionic forms in preventing bacterial growth.\u201d\n\nThis discovery could have far-reaching implications for the agriculture industry and food safety standards, providing a new layer of protection against microbial contamination. In addition to their work with nanoparticles, the team has been researching the resilience of Mexican brown rice, which showed notable resistance to bacterial growth due to its high content of essential minerals and bioactive compounds.\n\nThe team\u2019s study emphasizes how integrating nanotechnology into agricultural practices could revolutionize food safety by reducing contamination risks and enhancing crop resilience. Dr. Sharifan noted the potential policy implications of this work, saying, \u201cRegulatory bodies could consider nanofortification as part of agricultural practices, which could enhance resilience against such threats.\u201d\n\nThough challenges remain, such as optimizing sterilization processes and ensuring the consistent application of nanoparticles, the team is confident their research will have a lasting impact on food safety protocols.\n\nThis pioneering work marks UTEP\u2019s first collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, further establishing the university as a key player in agricultural biotechnology research.\n\nFor more details, read The Prospector\u2019s story here.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)"

While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 50 largest software companies by market cap.\n\nTo narrow down our list to high-growth software stocks, we focused on companies with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in net revenue exceeding 18% over the past 5 years.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of high-growth software stocks, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR and revenue CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of high-growth software stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024 are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT)\n\nTTM Net Income: $1.31 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 28.51%\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 23.11%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a cybersecurity company that develops and sells software and network security solutions. The company\u2019s portfolio of more than 50 enterprise-grade products is the largest integrated offering available, delivering protection to networks, users, and data from continually evolving threats.\n\nThe company is actively pursuing its strategy to lead in the rapidly growing Unified SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and Security Operations markets while also increasing its market share in Secure Networking. The company aims to differentiate itself as a SASE leader, being the only vendor recognized in multiple Gartner Magic Quadrant reports for both Single-Vendor SASE and various network security categories.
