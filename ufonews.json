Spanish Files offers a unique look into this fascinating chapter of Spanish history.\n\nFor more local news and events in the Almeria province click here."

(Photo: EPA-EFE / Rungroj Yongrit)\n\nThe ongoing mpox outbreak in Africa is a stark reminder of the persistent threat of infectious diseases. It also highlights a game-changing opportunity to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and digital health applications in response to not just mpox, but any future infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nAI\u2019s transformative potential, when integrated into digital health tools, can empower individuals and healthcare providers, enabling a more rapid, effective and equitable response to emerging health threats.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nThe rapid advances in AI over the past few years, particularly since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, offer a glimpse into a future where data-driven insights and intelligent tools can empower us to act swiftly and decisively against emerging health threats. AI-powered digital health apps can serve as critical tools in this endeavour.\n\nImagine two innovative applications: one designed for people to safely self-navigate infectious disease outbreaks and another tailored for community health workers to efficiently provide vaccinations and medical care. Both can revolutionise public health responses and enhance our ability to manage outbreaks proactively.\n\nDuring an infectious disease outbreak, timely and accurate information is crucial for the public to make informed decisions. An AI-powered app that helps individuals and families self-navigate outbreaks by providing real-time, personalised guidance based on the latest information can radically improve infectious disease response and containment.\n\nThe consumer app would deliver easy-to-understand and concise summaries of the pathogen, the most vulnerable cohorts, local exposure risk factors, a person\u2019s risk of death if infected, and the availability of vaccinations and infection treatment.\n\nSuch an app offers a single source of truth for informed infectious disease management tailored to each family\u2019s circumstances. The actionable insights are a lens into prevention measures, symptom monitoring and when to seek medical care.\n\nRead more: #InTheSpotlight \u2014 beyond the hype, what might AI actually mean for healthcare in SA?\n\nImagine AI-driven features that enable users to identify symptoms using image recognition (eg, skin lesions for mpox) or assess exposure risk through predictive modelling. These capabilities democratise access to critical health information, allowing people to manage their health proactively rather than reactively.\n\nThe app could also offer anonymous reporting features, enabling users to contribute data that improve public health surveillance without compromising privacy. In essence, this AI-powered tool would empower individuals to act as informed agents in their communities, helping to slow the spread of infectious diseases and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems.\n\nAI-enhanced app for community health workers\n\nCommunity health workers are the backbone of healthcare delivery in many under-served regions, particularly in Africa. An AI-powered digital health app tailored for these workers can enhance their ability to provide timely vaccinations and medical care for those affected by an infectious disease outbreak.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nBy integrating AI, the app can optimise resource allocation, such as identifying areas with the highest vaccination needs based on real-time data analysis of infection rates, demographic information and vaccination coverage.\n\nFurthermore, the app can incorporate AI-driven diagnostic tools, enabling community health workers to quickly and accurately diagnose diseases in remote settings where access to advanced medical equipment is limited. AI can guide healthcare workers through diagnostic procedures, ensure adherence to treatment protocols and offer real-time decision support based on the latest medical guidelines.\n\nBy streamlining data collection and reporting, the app would also reduce the administrative burden on community health workers, allowing them to focus more on patient care. The ultimate goal is to maximise the impact of each health worker, ensuring that the limited resources available are utilised most effectively to save lives.\n\nThe availability of smartphones across Africa is a powerful enabler for improving mpox response efforts. With smartphones, individuals and healthcare workers can easily access AI-powered digital health apps, making critical information, diagnostic tools and real-time guidance more accessible than ever before.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nThese devices facilitate rapid communication, data sharing and symptom tracking, empowering people and healthcare workers with timely and actionable information. Additionally, smartphones enable telemedicine consultations, reducing the need for in-person visits and minimising transmission risk.\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of infectious disease management and response.\n\nAI\u2019s broader potential\n\nThe mpox crisis in Africa underscores the urgent need for such AI-powered solutions. The challenges are immense: slow data dissemination and lack of data in general, overwhelmed healthcare systems and a lack of accessible information and resources.\n\nRead more: No mpox jabs for SA yet, but WHO and Africa CDC will help fund the fight against the outbreak\n\nAI can help bridge these gaps, empowering communities, healthcare workers and public health agencies with the tools they need to fight this outbreak and prepare for future ones.\n\nAI technologies can democratise access to health resources by allowing community members to self-diagnose potential symptoms using just their phones and by helping to rapidly train and deploy frontline community health workers.\n\nAI call centres and agents can help anonymously gather information from suspected and confirmed cases, reducing the heavy manual burden of traditional contact tracing and case investigation. AI can develop targeted interventions, helping public health decision-makers decide where to most effectively apply their limited resources, such as vaccines, to optimise their impact.\n\nThe path forward\n\nRealising the potential of AI-powered digital health apps requires immediate and sustained investment in AI research, development and infrastructure.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nWe must prioritise the development of AI-powered tools and technologies specifically tailored to the needs of Africa, ensuring they are accessible, affordable and culturally relevant. Moreover, investment in training and capacity building is essential to empower healthcare workers and communities to leverage these tools effectively.\n\nThe urgency of investing in AI capabilities is clear. We have a unique opportunity to harness AI\u2019s potential to combat the current mpox outbreak and build a more resilient global health infrastructure. By supporting AI research, development and deployment, we can empower healthcare workers, public health agencies and communities with data-driven insights and intelligent tools needed to respond effectively to emerging health threats.\n\nBy embracing these advancements and investing in AI technologies now, we can build a more resilient and responsive public health infrastructure, ensuring we are prepared to face future pandemics with the full force of human ingenuity and technological innovation.\n\nThe forthcoming World One Health Congress, which will be held in Cape Town on 19-22 September, will devote considerable focus to next-generation digital technologies in healthcare and pandemic response.\n\nThese technologies can deliver highly effective interventions that prevent disease outbreaks from spiralling into epidemics and pandemics, thus obviating the use of blunt instruments like travel bans and lockdowns.\n\nAI and digital health apps working in concert with existing countermeasures can only improve any infectious disease response. The elegance of AI is its self-learning foundation. With each new outbreak, the technology quickly adapts, becoming increasingly effective at pathogen containment.

        "article_content": "To keep the ghosts at bay, read on for Entertainment Weekly\u2019s list of the 30 best paranormal movies, ranked.\n\nParanormal movies mainly preside in the horror and thriller genres, but there are a few comedic or dramatic exceptions. Almost all of them offer audiences an indelible glimpse of the supernatural that real life, for better or worse, doesn\u2019t afford us. There\u2019s nothing like that implacable tingle, that crawling dread, of films like these.\n\nOne has to wonder how ghosts and ghouls have time to haunt us when they\u2019re so preoccupied acting in paranormal movies. Certainly, the genre lets us live vicariously through (often ill-fated) characters who either summon or accidentally encounter some of the other side\u2019s residents.\n\n30. Paranormal Activity (2007) Everett Collection Oren Peli\u2019s genre-defining found footage thriller stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat as a couple who believes their suburban home might be beset by malevolent forces of some kind. With the help of a handy digital camera, the pair set out to find the source of the nightly disturbances. The Paranormal Activity franchise has gone so far down the rabbit hole that it\u2019s easy to forget its ultra-simple, stripped-back roots. Peli structures his picture in the seamless style of old-school horror-thrillers, first by establishing the characters and then spinning scares from their relationship that further exacerbate the bumps in the night. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n29. Session 9 (2001) Everett Brad Anderson\u2019s skin-crawling ghost story follows a group of sanitation workers (led by David Caruso and Josh Lucas) who encounter some creepy goings-on, and even spookier recordings of therapy sessions, when they\u2019re sent to clean out a disused mental asylum. Journeyman director Anderson outdid himself with this rollicking yet understated horror-fest, which executes its finest scares without using much more than its ingeniously unsettling sound design. Where to watch Session 9: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n28. The Frighteners (1996) Everett Peter Jackson\u2019s jolly horror-comedy finds an architect turned exorcist (Michael J. Fox), who\u2019s able to communicate with departed spirits, trying to solve the mounting body count in his idyllic small town while romancing the widow (Trini Alvarado) of one of the victims. Nobody does their respective jobs as well as Jackson and Fox do theirs, and to see these two working together is almost too much goodness to behold. The Frighteners is just as goofy and splattery as you want a Jackson genre picture to be, anchored in a solid mystery and Fox\u2019s preternatural ability to command the screen. Where to watch The Frighteners: Tubi\n\n27. Insidious (2010) Everett Collection Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) move their family to what should be an idyllic suburban home; but when one of their children falls ill, the Lamberts uncover a much darker reason behind his ailment. James Wan\u2019s haunted house picture essentially birthed Blumhouse\u2019s brand of inexpensive, wildly lucrative horror. In the same vein of Paranormal Activity, Wan\u2019s film launched a sprawling franchise with a simple, effective formula that packed an additional wallop for having been absent from cinemas for some time by the 2010s. Where to watch Insidious: Peacock\n\n26. It Follows (2014) Everett David Robert Mitchell\u2019s astonishing paranormal picture has spawned a litany of imitators, none of which match It Follows\u2019 distinctive mix of mood, high-concept plotting, and propulsive fear. Jay (Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover he\u2019s passed along a fatal curse that she can only shake by sleeping with another person. And so it begins its shape-shifting pursuit \u2014 slow, deliberate, agonizingly persistent. Mitchell conjures a maddening sense of dread out of the simplest techniques; once we\u2019ve seen the entity walking toward Jay, every person casually moving in the background feels like a threat. Of course, It Follows is as much about growing up as it is about fear and sex \u2014 or, rather, it\u2019s about what\u2019s scary about growing up, the dying of the youthful presumption of safety, protection, and immortality. Where to watch It Follows: Netflix\n\n25. The Amityville Horror (1979) Everett Collection This classic haunted house tale tells the unfortunate \u201ctrue\u201d story of George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder), who buy a rambling house on Long Island only to discover its murderous past and supernatural inhabitants. A tremendously effective horror story that takes its time to eke out substantial frights, Stuart Rosenberg\u2019s completely over-the-top vision of yuppie-dom gone awry kicked off one of Hollywood\u2019s most dubious franchises. Though a few of the sequels have their merits, Amityville in Space and Amityville Karen remain for completists only. Where to watch The Amityville Horror: Max\n\n24. Sinister (2012) Phil Caruso/Summit Entertainment Scott Derrickson\u2019s brilliant found footage-cum-haunted house tale stars Ethan Hawke as a morally murky true crime journalist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and kids into the home where a brutal family murder took place, the inspiration for his latest book. Things go badly, and only get worse when Hawke finds a box of 16mm snuff films in the attic. Derrickson is a woefully underrated horror director, and Sinister is his crowning achievement. The gory recordings are photographed in a surrealistic, utterly chilling manner, and, set to Christopher Young\u2019s masterful industrial score, they carry an uncommon power. Where to watch Sinister: Max\n\n23. Child\u2019s Play (1988) United Artists/Everett Tom Holland\u2019s franchise kick-off finds the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transferred into a cherubic Good Guys doll named Chucky. When the toy makes its way into the home of Andy (Alex Vincent) and his exhausted mother (Catherine Hicks), only a dedicated detective (Chris Sarandon) can stop the bloodshed. Holland treats the idea of a loony murderer\u2019s spirit occupying a doll\u2019s form with an uncommon seriousness. Though some of the later installments veered into comedy, this original makes a compelling case for taking Chucky very seriously indeed. Where to watch Child\u2019s Play: Tubi\n\n22. Final Destination 2 (2003) Everett Collection David R. Ellis\u2019 wildly entertaining first sequel in the admirably consistent franchise follows a group of spring-break revelers (led by A.J. Cook and returning star Ali Larter) who manage to avoid a catastrophic highway pileup only to find themselves being picked off, one by one, by that dreaded specter known as Death. Breathtakingly gory and hell-bent on a very particular type of early-aughts destruction, Final Destination 2 is a slasher movie crossed with something approaching a supernatural action film. It\u2019s remarkably entertaining and always rewatchable, with a few murder set pieces that will make you genuinely wince. Where to watch Final Destination 2: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. Ringu (1998) Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter, sets out with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to investigate the ghostly phenomenon of a disturbing videotape that seemingly killed her niece. Hideo Nakata\u2019s seminal fright flick kicked off a sprawling franchise across several continents, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Ringu possesses a singular sort of fear that few films can pull off. Watching it leaves you with that unshakeable, unpleasant feeling of recalling too vividly a particularly disturbing nightmare. Where to watch Ringu: Tubi\n\n20. The Others (2001) Everett Collection Grace (Nicole Kidman) moves with her children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), who possess a sunlight allergy, into an isolated country cottage as she awaits the return of her husband from fighting in WWII. There, the arrival of a governess (Fionnula Flanagan) and her peers kicks off a series of horrifying supernatural occurrences that threaten to unravel Grace\u2019s reality. A wonderfully paced, brazenly old-fashioned ghost story, The Others feels timeless as all the best horror films do. Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar directs with a lush eye for atmosphere and details, while the oft-imitated twist ending feels earned and emotionally cathartic. Where to watch The Others: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n19. The Eye (2002) Everett The Pang Brothers\u2019 ultra-spooky immersion into the supernatural underworld stars Angelica Lee as Mun, a prodigious blind musician who is gifted sight with a radical corneal transplant. Yet as she\u2019s tormented by visions of the dead, Mun wonders if sight is worth her mental sanity. One of Hong Kong\u2019s signature modern thrillers, The Eye got swept up in American audiences\u2019 fascination with Asian horror from the late \u201990s through the aughts, later receiving an obligatory remake in 2008 starring Jessica Alba. Like most modern horror encores, that version is best left unseen; it can\u2019t match the Pangs\u2019 contemporary twist on classical, spine-tingling fright. Where to watch The Eye: Not available to stream\n\n18. The Beyond (1981) Everett Collection Lucio Fulci\u2019s paranormal masterwork concerns a young woman (Catriona MacColl) who inherits a palatial hotel that sits above the gates of hell. Predictably, things don\u2019t go so well for her. To define what the experience of The Beyond is actually like is\u2026 well, if you\u2019ll forgive the paraphrased steal from Casablanca, it\u2019s like any other Italian horror movie, only more so. Fulci embraces nightmare logic as enthusiastically as any filmmaker of his genre or generation, and this film is him at his gorily most unhinged. He indulges his penchant for toe-curling eyeball violence and subtly effective set design in this everything-and-the-kitchen-sink haunted house riff. Where to watch The Beyond: Peacock\n\n17. Jennifer\u2019s Body (2009) Doane Gregory/TM and Fox Atomic/Courtesy Everett Collection Karyn Kusama\u2019s supernatural high-school dark comedy, written by Diablo Cody, is utterly excellent despite its initially lackluster reviews. Amanda Seyfried plays Needy Lesnicky, the dowdy best friend to the popular/hot/cool/flexible Jennifer Check (Megan Fox). When Jennifer is sacrificed as part of a devilish ritual by a skeevy rock band, she returns as a succubus with a taste for teenage boys\u2019 flesh. Jennifer\u2019s Body is one of those perfect fusions of time and place, capturing that mid-aughts period when pop culture was paradoxically alt. Cody also flexes her sprawling knowledge of the horror genre, making for a riotously entertaining film with a ferocious satirical undercurrent. Where to watch Jennifer\u2019s Body: Tubi\n\n16. Talk to Me (2022) A24 This recent A24 effort from Australian directors Danny and Michael Philippou is one of the studio\u2019s scariest outputs yet. A mummified hand that can imbue its possessors with both horrifying glimpses of the afterlife and a drug-life euphoria threatens to undo a suburban family when a young boy (the stupendously natural Joe Bird) spends too long on the other side and becomes possessed. Remarkably unsettling and shockingly brutal, Talk to Me is a singular horror film that ranks among this decade\u2019s finest. With a smart application of style and humor, the Philippous crafted a relentless modern chiller. Where to watch Talk to Me: Paramount+\n\n15. Suspiria (1977) 20th Century Studios Dario Argento\u2019s groundbreaking opera of furious sight and sound concerns young Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), who upon being sent to a prestigious German ballet academy discovers that it is but a front for a coven of youth-siphoning witches. Argento\u2019s galvanizing picture remains a masterclass in harnessing the power of image and music to beguile an audience. It also feels as fresh and exciting today as it did almost 50 years ago. Where to watch Suspiria: Xumo Play\n\n14. Lake Mungo (2008) Mungo Productions After their teenage daughter (Talia Zucker) drowns, a family begins experiencing strange events in their home. They call in a paranormal psychologist, who uncovers disturbing secrets while parsing through their surveillance camera and cell phone footage. This is a particularly somber and understated movie, resembling domestic dramas like Ordinary People more than traditional horror films. With a canny mix of found footage and faux-documentary, Lake Mungo transports the audience into its spare, chilling universe. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n13. Hereditary (2018) Toni Collette; Hereditary. A24 Ari Aster\u2019s astonishingly original yet somehow terrifically old-fashioned ghost-and-witchcraft story stars Toni Collette as a bereaved mother who turns to the paranormal in the hopes of contacting family members she\u2019s recently lost. As the supposedly well-intentioned woman leading her to doom, Ann Dowd commits to one of the most insidious villain performances in modern horror history. The movie that established Aster as an art-house freakout auteur, Hereditary is breathtakingly, exhaustively intense and frequently just as emotional. That Collette didn\u2019t collect an Oscar nomination for this role is a stain on the Academy. Where to watch Hereditary: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n12. The Orphanage (2007) Everett Collection J.A. Bayona directed this Spanish production about a young woman (Bel\u00e9n Rueda) who buys the orphanage in which she grew up with the intention of converting it into a home for infirm children. When her son goes missing, she turns to the many ghosts residing within the home to aid her desperate search. More than a bit inspired by Guillermo del Toro\u2019s The Devil\u2019s Backbone, The Orphanage weaves a similarly melancholy and thematically rich haunted house tale that calls on the country\u2019s complicated past to inflect its plot with verisimilitude. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s exceptionally scary. Where to watch The Orphanage: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n11. Jacob\u2019s Ladder (1990) Everett Adrian Lyne\u2019s mind-warping erotic thriller stars Tim Robbins as a Vietnam vet plagued with horrifying hallucinations once he returns stateside. As he discovers he's not the only member of his platoon to experience such oddities, Jacob is further removed from his already tenuous reality. A thoughtful and enveloping exploration of psychosis, Lyne\u2019s film remains a high-water mark in the psychological freak-out genre. Robbins grounds the eccentric proceedings with his reliable everyman persona, while Lynne one-ups his signature opulent visual style in such a way that he often wrong-foots the audience\u2019s genre expectations with nothing more than a simple camera move. Where to watch Jacob\u2019s Ladder: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10. The Sixth Sense (1999) Everett Collection Young Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is plagued by visions of those who died violent deaths. His exasperated mother (Toni Collette) seeks help in the form of a psychologist (Bruce Willis), who may have more in common with Cole than he thinks. M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s classic ghost story popularized a now-ubiquitous twist ending and got all of us swearing we saw dead people. It\u2019s still a hard-edged, substantially creepy fable with a heart-wrenching central performance from Osment and some of Willis\u2019 best dramatic acting. Where to watch The Sixth Sense: Max\n\n9. Cat People (1942) Everett Collection A well-intentioned husband (Kent Smith) accidentally ignites his wife\u2019s (Simone Simon) supernatural curse, in which she transforms into a large feline when aroused. She then goes about stalking her nemeses, including the beautiful woman (Jane Randolph) with whom her partner has become infatuated. Jacques Tourneur\u2019s fabulously creepy and macabre exploration of jealous sexual awakening features some unbelievably detailed sets and camerawork that seem innovative even today. Far from the staid paranormal horrors produced during this period, Cat People is ferocious and mysterious in equal measure. Where to watch Cat People: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n8. Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968) Courtesy Everett Collection Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s satirical shocker stars Mia Farrow as a young housewife who begins to believe her dream pregnancy is a cover for something much more nefarious, as her actor husband (John Cassavetes) brings an eccentric elderly couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) uncomfortably into their lives. Polanski\u2019s picture is elegant yet abrasive, an uncommonly lovely combination. Farrow is terrific in the lead role, getting the audience almost instantly on her side as the director ratchets up the tension to an unbearably chilling climax. Where to watch Rosemary\u2019s Baby: Paramount+\n\n7. Poltergeist (1982) Everett Collection Tobe Hooper\u2019s story about a suburban family (helmed by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) beset by paranormal activity in their new home, which may or may not be built on an ancient burial ground, is completely insane. It\u2019s one of the first horror movies to feel like an out-and-out action (or even disaster) movie, with crumbling sets and flashing lights right out of a Clive Barker climax. Poltergeist has endured, though, because its scares are rooted in this authentic family unit\u2019s terror. We feel for them, and the dissolution of their \u2014 \u201980s American dream. Where to watch Poltergeist: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n6. The Innocents (1961) 20th Century Fox Film Corp./Courtesy Everett Based on Henry James\u2019 The Turn of the Screw, Jack Clayton\u2019s spine-chilling ghost story (with a script by Truman Capote, among others) stars Deborah Kerr as a governess sent to an isolated estate to care for two odd children (Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin). There, she encounters \u2014 what else? \u2014 disembodied voices and vengeful spirits. Clayton\u2019s exceptionally frightening haunted house picture established many of the genre\u2019s most beloved tropes, a great deal of which are still in circulation today. Nearly every film on this list has arguably drawn inspiration from The Innocents. Here, Clayton creates a masterful mood of dread and dense mystery within a rich and oddly cozy atmosphere. Where to watch The Innocents: Not available to stream\n\n5. Hausu (1977) Everett There\u2019s no other way to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s film except for \u201cgenuinely f\u2014ing crazy.\u201d Even to call it a haunted house movie seems tame; it\u2019s more of a spiritual home invasion, really. A group of seven schoolgirls \u2014 all with cheeky names like Kung Fu and Mac (for \u201cstomach,\u201d because she likes to eat) \u2014 venture to the home of one girl\u2019s aunt, where they\u2019re beset by disembodied, bottom-chomping heads, possessed mattresses, and hungry ghosts. Obayashi\u2019s picture is an authentically singular experience, and also a rather sweet one. It plays like a live-action, exaggeratedly silly Studio Ghibli movie. Where to watch Hausu: Max\n\n4. The Haunting (1963) Everett Collection Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of Shirley Jackson\u2019s masterful novella finds a specially selected group of people brought together to spend a night at the famously haunted Hill House. Each has their different motives \u2014 Eleanor (Julie Harris) wishes to separate from her overbearing family; a gregarious psychic (Claire Bloom) hopes to write a bestselling book; Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) wants to uncover the home\u2019s paranormal truth. Joined by the home\u2019s heir (Russ Tamblyn), they set about uncovering the home\u2019s insidious past. Wise crafts an elegant and memorable ghost story here, retaining much of Jackson\u2019s scabrous dialogue while improving upon the suspense set pieces established in her book.\u200b\u200b It\u2019s one of the spookiest, and most elegant, haunted house pictures ever made. Where to watch The Haunting: Tubi\n\n3. The Shining (1980) Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) encounters the Grady twins (Lisa and Louise Burns) inside the Overlook Hotel in 'The Shining.'. Warner Brothers/courtesy Everett Stanley Kubrick\u2019s supernatural opus continues to spark scrutiny and debate almost 50 years later. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a has-been writer, takes a job at the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker so he can write his next novel. Soon, his family (wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd) experiences gory hallucinations and unexplainable events within the corridors. Kubrick\u2019s film is a devastatingly rendered portrait of an artist\u2019s descent into psychosis, one that\u2019s implicit through the pursuit of crafting a great work. The Shining is every bit as meticulous and fetishistic as its reputation would suggest, with Kubrick using his stern directorial hand to create a sense of unease on screen. Where to watch The Shining: Max\n\n2. Evil Dead II (1987) Everett Sam Raimi\u2019s gleeful, gore-gag-laden romp (essentially a higher-budget, more jocular spin on his 1981 original) finds Bruce Campbell\u2019s Ash once again battling a group of Deadites in a remote cabin. Raimi strikes an inimitable tone of feel-good fun that precious few films are able to attain, let alone those in the horror genre. The director previously compared this movie to The Three Stooges with viscera standing in for custard pies, and that\u2019s the precise vibe one feels upon viewing. There\u2019s nothing offensive or off-putting in Evil Dead II, only a merry sense of the possibilities paranormal filmmaking presents. Where to watch Evil Dead II: Plex"

The film claims that the husband of Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, who died in 2021, was supposed to meet with an alien at some point, the Radar.online portal reports.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, who died at the age of 99, has always been actively interested in paranormal phenomena, extraterrestrial civilizations, and was fascinated by the appearance of crop circles in different parts of the world.\n\nThe documentary claims that through the groom of Prince Peter Horsley, an agreement was reached on a meeting with a certain mysterious Janus \u2014 alien, which was to take place in an apartment in Chelsea. Janus wanted to give Philip information about saving the planet.\n\n\"The meeting never took place, and most likely this character Janus was actually a Russian spy,\" the film says.\n\nIn addition, historian Richard Felix in the film suggests that the late Queen Elizabeth wanted to study the secret documents of the Vatican.\n\nAccording to Felix, at the headquarters of the Catholic Church in The Vatican has a well-known secret archive where documents are kept, possibly several thousand years old, which describe in detail the origins of Christianity and the like. But there are also claims circulating that they are keeping the truth about the UFO phenomenon.\n\n\"Fifty-three miles of corridors full of secret documents and objects, including alien skulls in the basements of the Vatican and other things. In other words, they are fascinated by aliens,\" the historian said.\n\nHe noted that the The Vatican has an observatory in Arizona, as well as in the Pope's summer palace in Rome.\n\n\"He has his own cardinal and monsignors appointed to resolve the issue of first contact with extraterrestrials. There is some speculation that they were privy to the landing of UFOs in Sicily during the Second World War ... and, of course, the orange saucer\u2014shaped ship was seen more than once hovering over the Vatican,\" he said.\n\nThe description of the film on the IMDb portal (Internet Movie Database) states that \"the film explores the interest of the British royal family in UFOs and paranormal phenomena since the time of Lord Louis Mountbatten (1900-1979), Prince Philip, and now King Charles.

Similar wasp species are known to target flies during their younger, more vulnerable larva and pupa life stages.\n\nThe study, led by Logan Moore during his doctoral studies at Mississippi State University, was published in the journal Nature on September 11.

The egg then hatches into a tiny wasp larva, which grows inside the fly for about 18 days before leaving its host for dead.\n\n\"It will effectively emerge out of the side of the fly, and just to add an additional layer of horror, the fly will normally remain alive for several hours after that,\" Morre said, explaining the chilling process."

        "article_content": "Nobel laureate Andre Konstantin Geim called on the next generation of scientists to resist the pull of routine and go beyond the confines of their job descriptions in order to make meaningful contributions to their fields.\n\n\u201cToo many brilliant minds have wasted their lives trapped in the comfort of routine. It is when we step outside our comfort zones and explore new ideas that we often find ourselves doing the most important things in our lives and careers,\u201d said Geim, Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor, University of Manchester, UK.\n\nProf Geim was in Chennai on Saturday, addressing the 15th Convocation of Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science (HITS).\n\nGeim highlighted the challenges and rewards of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. He urged the graduates to embrace both the challenges and opportunities ahead and to push beyond conventional limits in their pursuit of discovery.\n\nHe pointed out that his most impactful work emerged from simple, curiosity-driven projects he pursued outside of his official duties. \u201cA mere act of pouring water into an electromagnet led to the world\u2019s first demonstration of magnetic levitation. Similarly, an attempt to mimic how geckos climb walls resulted in the creation of a revolutionary dry adhesive, now a major research topic,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Geim, a Dutch-British physicist of Russian descent, is renowned for his pioneering work in condensed matter physics and material science. His most notable achievement is the discovery of graphene, which earned him the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Konstantin Novoselov.\n\nNote on his discovery of graphene\n\nDelving into the details of his Nobel Prize-winning discovery of graphene, Geim highlighted how curiosity served as the driving force behind the breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019m not even a biologist! The experiment that earned me the Nobel Prize began with a simple question: What if we keep dividing graphite into smaller and smaller pieces until it can\u2019t be divided any further? This curiosity led to the discovery of graphene, the thinnest material in existence. It is through these moments of curiosity and daring to think beyond routine that we make our most significant breakthroughs, often the turning points of our careers,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian aerospace scientist and Padma Bhushan awardee Nambi Narayanan shared the challenging journey of ISRO scientists in developing a liquid-fueled rocket engine. This technology now powers many of the country\u2019s successful space missions and marks a pivotal moment in the nation\u2019s space exploration efforts.\n\nP Veeramuthuvel, Project Director at ISRO, also addressed the convocation, discussing the challenges faced during the Chandrayaan-3 mission. He stressed the importance of learning from failures, highlighting resilience, teamwork, and rigorous testing as crucial elements in overcoming obstacles and achieving success.\n\nAnand Jacob Verghese, Chancellor of HITS and Chairman of the Hindustan Group of Institutions, called on the new graduates to harness their knowledge and skills to make a meaningful impact on society.

        "article_content": "Wounds that resist healing have long posed a significant challenge in medical care, but a recent discovery offers a solution that combines luxury with cutting-edge science.\n\nResearchers have tapped into the remarkable healing properties of gold nanoparticles mixed with antioxidant-rich red wine.\n\nThis unexpected fusion of precious metal and natural compounds paves the way for a revolutionary approach to treating chronic wounds and other medical conditions.\n\nTraditional medicine and new technology\n\nIn the heart of South Africa, the University of the Western Cape hosts a team of researchers driven to make significant strides in medical science.\n\nThe team\u2019s dedication to exploring novel solutions for persistent health challenges has led them to a fascinating discovery that blends traditional medicine with cutting-edge technology.\n\nTheir latest research was focused on a concoction combining gold nanoparticles with the potent antioxidants found in red wine. The innovative formula has shown tremendous potential, as lab tests revealed that it significantly accelerated wound healing.\n\nRemarkably, in just 72 hours, wounds treated with this unique mixture of gold and red wine healed almost entirely \u2013 a promising and exciting outcome that could pave the way for future advancements in chronic wound care.\n\nThe dangers of chronic wounds\n\nChronic wounds, defined as those that fail to heal within three months, represent a widespread and persistent health challenge, affecting approximately 3.8 million patients each year.\n\nChronic wounds often stall in the inflammatory phase, a stage where the body\u2019s natural healing processes become hindered. This prevents progression to the crucial remodeling phase where new tissue begins to grow and repair the damaged area.\n\nFor individuals with underlying conditions like diabetes, this issue becomes even more serious. Poor blood circulation, a common complication of diabetes, exacerbates the healing process, leaving these wounds vulnerable to infections.\n\nIn severe cases, the inability to heal can lead to devastating outcomes, including the risk of limb amputation. Identifying solutions for chronic wound care is a medical priority.\n\nThe wound healing power of gold\n\nThe research team hypothesized that gold could act as the ideal catalyst to jump-start the healing process for chronic wounds.\n\nGold\u2019s renowned anti-inflammatory properties, combined with its natural compatibility with human tissues, have made it a valuable element in medical treatments for centuries.\n\nIts unique ability to reduce inflammation without causing adverse reactions allows gold to interact harmoniously with the body, promoting faster recovery.\n\nHistorically, gold has played a significant role in medicine, with gold particles being used as early as the 20th century to treat chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis in the UK.\n\nBuilding on this legacy, the research team explored how gold could unlock similar benefits in the realm of wound care, providing a modern twist to an age-old remedy.\n\nPowerful antioxidants of red wine\n\nRed grapes, the foundation of many popular wines, are rich in powerful antioxidants like resveratrol. These naturally occurring compounds play a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative stress by neutralizing harmful free radicals.\n\nFree radicals can damage cells and impede the healing process, but the antioxidants in red wine help to counteract these effects.\n\nBy combating these damaging molecules, resveratrol and other antioxidants support the body\u2019s ability to repair itself.\n\nThe antioxidants ensure that tissues receive a sufficient oxygen supply, which is essential for regeneration and recovery, ultimately boosting the healing process and enhancing the body\u2019s natural defenses.\n\nCombining gold and red wine\n\nThe team tested their hypothesis by drying red wine to obtain extracts, which were then mixed with chloroauric acid, a gold-containing chemical.\n\nThe blend was applied to a lab dish containing human skin cells, with a scratch in the middle to simulate a wound.\n\nCells treated with this golden mixture saw an 80% wound closure within 72 hours, compared to 50% with wine alone.\n\nThe combination of cabernet sauvignon and gold proved even more effective, healing wounds almost entirely in the same time frame.\n\nThe future of wound care\n\nRenowned vascular surgeon Stella Vig of Croydon University Hospital praised the novel use of red wine and the innovative production of gold nanoparticles. Both silver and gold nanoparticles could play a critical role in reducing wound infections.\n\nDr. Ahmed Osman from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast added that gold particles encourage cell growth and enhance the natural healing process of the skin.\n\nThis revolutionary approach to wound healing, combining gold and red wine, holds remarkable promise for the future of wound care.\n\nWhile further research is needed, the implications are significant, opening new avenues for advanced medical treatments.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

        "article_content": "If Derek Carr was a big surprise in Week 1, what we saw in Dallas was downright shocking. After the Cowboys made Deshaun Watson look like a backup QB at best in Week 1, despite Carr and the Saints' offense being a tougher test from an offensive perspective, it was widely expected Dallas could still pressure Carr and force him into some mistakes and limit the explosive plays. But that couldn't have been further from the truth as the Saints throttled the Cowboys, 44-19. Carr went 11-for-16 for 243 yards and two touchdowns. He was picked off once, but he likely would have put up even bigger numbers if the game was more competitive. The Saints get the Eagles next, and despite a much-improved secondary, they showed in Week 1 against the Packers that they're still susceptible to splash plays. We'll see if Carr can keep the good times rolling.\n\nSome rushing quarterbacks showed that it's not always all sunshine and rainbows for the dual threats. Anthony Richardson almost orchestrated a late comeback against the Packers, but he was just 17-for-34 for 204 yards and one touchdown. But he also tossed three picks to just one touchdown. He also fumbled the ball twice, but luckily the Colts never lost possession on those. And Jayden Daniels struggled despite going up against a Giants defense that made Sam Darnold look like a Pro-Bowler. Daniels rushed for 44 yards, but he only managed 226 yards through the air without a touchdown. Top wide receiver Terry McLaurin hauled in six catches but for just 22 yards. Daniels hasn't taken too many shots downfield, which is really hampering McLaurin's value thus far.\n\nAnd then of course there were injuries. Jordan Love was unsurprisingly inactive, which allowed Malik Willis to get the start for the Packers. After looking abysmal in previous appearances, Willis leaned on Josh Jacobs and the running game, but he also looked more competent than he has in previous action with the Titans. But the biggest quarterback injury story is with Tua Tagovailoa. With a well-documented history of concussions, Tua lowered his head and was taken down by what seemed like an ordinary tackle from Damar Hamlin. But Tua clearly suffered more head trauma on the play, and was diagnosed with another concussion. While Tua's health is the primary concern, Skylar Thompson is the next man up. Given the injury history, we're treating this as if Tua's out indefinitely, and the Dolphins may be searching for an upgrade over Thompson.\n\nFantasy QB Rankings Week 3: Who to start, sit at quarterback\n\nThese rankings are based on four-point passing TD scoring. These rankings will be updated throughout the week, so check back often.\n\nRANK PLAYER NAME TEAM OPPONENT 1 Josh Allen BUF vs. JAC 2 Lamar Jackson BAL at DAL 3 Jalen Hurts PHI at NO 4 Patrick Mahomes II KC at ATL 5 Kyler Murray ARI vs. DET 6 Anthony Richardson IND vs. CHI 7 C.J. Stroud HOU at MIN 8 Jared Goff DET at ARI 9 Jayden Daniels WAS at CIN 10 Joe Burrow CIN vs. WAS 11 Dak Prescott DAL vs. BAL 12 Baker Mayfield TB vs. DEN 13 Brock Purdy SF at LAR 14 Matthew Stafford LAR vs. SF 15 Derek Carr NO vs. PHI 16 Caleb Williams CHI at IND 17 Geno Smith SEA vs. MIA 18 Gardner Minshew II LV vs. CAR 19 Justin Herbert LAC at PIT 20 Trevor Lawrence JAC at BUF 21 Justin Fields PIT vs. LAC 22 Kirk Cousins ATL vs. KC 23 Aaron Rodgers NYJ vs. NE 24 Will Levis TEN vs. GB 25 Bo Nix DEN at TB 26 Malik Willis GB at TEN 27 Deshaun Watson CLE vs. NYG 28 Sam Darnold MIN vs. HOU 29 Skylar Thompson MIA at SEA 30 Jacoby Brissett NE at NYJ 31 Daniel Jones NYG at CLE 32 Bryce Young CAR at LV\n\nWho are the best fantasy QBs for Week 3?\n\nThe top-3 quarterbacks remain the same for Week 3 yet again, but Lamar Jackson slides in as QB2, swapping spots with Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts. Josh Allen continues to have the top spot on lock. Week 2 was very disappointing for Allen fantasy managers, but it was a game script issue. Buffalo jumped out to an early lead on the back of James Cook and never looked back. And when Tua Tagovailoa went down with the concussion, it was clear Miami wouldn't be able to mount much of a comeback and force Allen to take to the air. This was a fluke, though, and we expect Allen to bounce back against the Jags.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of Week 2 was the Raiders upending the Ravens, sending Baltimore to a rough 0-2 start to the season. Lamar Jackson had a pretty pedestrian performance, going 21-for-34 for 247 yards, 1 TD and 1 INT. He did rush five times for 45 yards, but a good chunk of that came on the game's final desperation play. Jackson is too explosive of a player to think he won't turn things around in what should be an exciting matchup with the Cowboys.\n\nWho are the best fantasy QB waiver pickups Week 3?\n\nWe already sang Derek Carr's praises in our introduction, and he's somehow rostered in just 19 percent of leagues. It's clear that Klint Kubiak's new offense is a massive upgrade over what the Saints were running last season, and Carr is taking advantage. Carr has been putting up these surprising numbers, and Chris Olave hasn't even really gotten going yet. If Rashid Shaheed keeps producing, he should start taking some attention away from Olave.\n\nAnd Geno Smith had a big day for the Seahawks, going 33-for-44 for 327 yards and one touchdown against what seems to be a fairly stout Patriots defense. With bruising running back Kenneth Walker sitting with an oblique injury, and trailing for much of the game, Smith had to take things to the air, and both DK Metcalf (10-129-1) and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (12-117-0) had big days. Smith is rostered in only 34 percent of leagues, so if he's available he's a great backup option or starter in 2QB leagues.\n\nWho are the best fantasy QB sleepers Week 3?\n\nAfter shocking the Baltimore Ravens, Raider QB Gardner Minshew checks in as our top sleeper at the position heading into Week 3. Minshew went 30-for-38 for 276 yards with 1 TD and 1 INT. After a quiet Week 1, Minshew got Davante Adams going as the star WR hauled in nine catches for 110 yards and a touchdown. Rookie tight end Brock Bowers also put forth a second-straight impressive performance with nine catches for 98 yards. The Raiders love to lean on the running game, which is a concern since the Panthers look pretty inept thus far, but Minshew should have opportunities to put up some numbers.\n\nWhat are the biggest QB injuries Week 3?\n\nWe already touched on the injury to Tua Tagovailoa. Obviously the primary concern is on Tua's health, but from a fantasy perspective, it will be interesting to see if the Dolphins bring anyone else in. Skylar Thompson is a big drop-off, and this doesn't appear to be a one or two week absence as of now. So will Miami reach out to a free agent like Ryan Tannehill? Or will they hit the phones and look for a trade? The Eagles have former first round pick Kenny Pickett as their backup, but also have a capable option behind him in Tanner McKee, so perhaps a deal could be struck.\n\nThere was some chatter this week that Jordan Love may have somehow been available for this week's game against the Colts, but that never seemed very legit. In fact, it's now being reported that Love will likely miss Week 3 as well, but he could return in Week 4. It was widely expected that Malik Willis would fall flat on his face this week, but he actually led Green Bay to a victory. He didn't look like a good quarterback, but he looked better than he ever has in the past, so there's a glimmer of hope that he might be able to produce in a revenge matchup against the Titans this week."

When they arrived in town, Katelyn Potts went to Sleep in Heavenly Peace's website to see if there was a chapter she could join.\n\nThere wasn't a local chapter, so she started her own last month.\n\nMTN News\n\n\u201cThe estimate is 3% nationwide of kids sleep on the floor, so that's either a mattress on the floor, the floor itself, a couch, whatever it may be,\u201d Katelyn Potts said. \u201cIt definitely is needed here. It's needed everywhere, but it's needed here.\u201d\n\nTheir goal is to build and deliver fully furnished beds to kids in our community that don't have one.\n\n\u201cI know there's a lot of good nonprofits out there that do a lot of things, but there's plenty of kids in our community that I know are sleeping without beds,\u201d Adam Potts said. \"She (Katelyn) approached me as something she wanted to get started. So as a good husband and a supporter of her, I said yes. And as soon as we started getting involved, I was excited about it.\"\n\nBefore they can start building, they need the communities help.\n\nMTN News\n\n\"The whole goal of it is to get as much community members involved as possible. We want as many hands on that bed and impacting that child's story because that helps people build their story, the Sleep in Heavenly Peace, and that helps get the word around as to who we are and what we do,\" Katelyn Potts said. \"You can either do a donation, request to volunteer with us, or partner with us. So we would partner with different organizations, depending on how many beds they want to sponsor. We would bring all of our tools and equipment to that bed build.\"\n\nThey will accept donations of new bedding or handmade quilts to furnish the beds.\n\n\"Sometimes we hear stories about a child being sixteen and that's their very first bed. It's just mind blowing. It's not something you think about on a day to day basis. It's something I think about all the time now. But it's not something people just think about,\" Katelyn Potts said. \"I would say every child deserves a good night's sleep. And they need it. It helps them get through the school day. It helps them get through. Maybe there's some rough things going on at home. But being able to have a good night's rest, it all starts at home.\"\n\nTo get involved with the Billings chapter of Sleep in Heavenly click here.\n\n\u201cWe want to get Billings involved to help get the children of Billings off the floor,\u201d Katelyn Potts said."
