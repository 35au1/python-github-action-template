        "article_content": "UFOs came to Washington again last week.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. at 11:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday, Nov. 13. Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) is a relatively new catch-all term that includes sightings of unexplained objects or events that take place in the air, underwater, in space, or that travel between those domains.\n\nLike previous congressional UFO hearings, the event featured testimony from current U.S. military personnel who claim the American government has for decades hidden evidence of advanced technologies and otherworldly visitors from the public. A multitude of anecdotes were presented about flying orbs coming out of the ocean, disc-shaped objects, and craft \"exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" While such claims are nothing new, what is noteworthy about the hearing are the pedigrees of some of the whistleblowers who testified, including a former U.S. counterintelligence officer, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former NASA associate administrator. All of them stressed the need for more government transparency, less stigma about the UFO topic and new policies to bring UAP data out of the \"black\" classified world and into the public domain.\n\nA still from a video titled \"Go Fast\" recorded by a U.S. Navy aircraft reportedly showing a UAP that was discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" on Wednesday (Nov. 13). (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nThis isn't the U.S. government's first attempt to investigate the recent wave of UFO claims that began in 2017. A similar hearing was held last year, in which a whistleblower told Congress the U.S. government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence.'\n\nThe Pentagon also created the All-Doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP reports and government data about UFOs, but critics, including some government officials, are skeptical of the office's aims and methods.\n\nRelated: SETI searches for alien life in over 1,000 galaxies using unexplored radio frequencies\n\n\"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\"\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOther representatives stressed the need for transparency and data analysis, a common theme of other recent UAP studies. \"We have evidence that what we are detecting things, and we know that we don't understand them, and this is worth investigating,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. \"I believe we can always be more transparent. To me, this hearing and others are simply about the truth and getting to the facts of what these UAPs actually are.\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former U.S. counterintelligence officer who has been vocal about such claims in recent years, told the assembled representatives at the hearing that \"excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" Elizondo stated during his testimony.\n\nElizondo, who claims to have previously investigated UFOs as part of a secret Pentagon program, suggested that the U.S. government create a \"whole-of-government\" approach to studying UAP, create a national UAP strategy and offer protections so that whistleblowers who are \"desperate to do the right thing can come forward without fear.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Elizondo was asked if some of the \"advanced technologies\" that have been seen monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe could be operated by aliens or private companies. \"Maybe both,\" Elizondo replied.\n\nElizondo also stated point-blank to Rep. Mace's questioning that the U.S. government has programs to retrieve crashed UAP and reverse-engineer them, but avoided giving any specifics in an unclassified public setting such as the hearing.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) then questioned Elizondo, asking the former counterintelligence agent about a document he signed that limits him from speaking publicly about crash retrieval programs. \"The document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you know, you can't talk about Fight Club if there's no Fight Club, correct?\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Elizondo stated that the alleged excessive government secrecy around UFOs harms national security. In response to questioning from Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Elizondo stated that, if UAP sightings turned out to be technologies operated by adversarial nations, it would be \"an intelligence failure eclipsing 9/11 in order of magnitude.\"\n\nA still from footage shot by an MQ-9 reaper drone showing an unidentified spherical object soaring through the air shown to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services during an April 2023 hearing. (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nRetired U.S. Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet offered similar testimony as Elizondo. \"We know from last year's UAP hearing and recent statements and publications by credible whistleblowers that UAP, NHI [non-human intelligence], and their technology of unknown origin (TUO) represent a new realization that we are not the only advanced intelligence in the universe,\" Gallaudet said on Wednesday, according to his published remarks.\n\n\"Unelected officials in the U.S. government do not have an exclusive right to this knowledge about the nature of reality. The American people have a right to that knowledge,\" Gallaudet said. The retired rear admiral also stressed the national security and airspace safety concerns related with UAP sightings, calling them \"extensive.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Garcia asked Gallaudet and other witnesses what UAP might represent, the retired rear admiral said he believes they are evidence of a \"non-human higher intelligence.\"\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold also testified at the hearing, and previously served on NASA's UAP study team. Gold's testimony was more grounded; for example, he stressed the need for NASA to contribute its authority and expertise toward analyzing what UAP data it might already possess and helping dispel the stigma associated with the UFO topic.\n\n\"Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science, but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA search team elicits such a vitriolic response,\" Gold said during the hearing. \"Therefore, one of the most important actions that can be taken, relative to exposing the truth of UAP, is to combat the stigma, and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful.\"\n\nGold added that NASA has a massive archive of data that could possibly contain evidence of UAP, and suggested that artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms could help sort through the agency's trove of data to help shine light on the UFO phenomenon. In addition, the former NASA associate administrator said the agency should develop specialized instruments that might be able to gather useful data about UAP.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger also testified, telling the representatives that there's a \"growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly called UFOs, and that elements within the military and IC [intelligence community] are in violation of their Constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.\"\n\nShellenberger stated that there is a secret program within the U.S. government known as \"Immaculate Constellation\" whose sole purpose is to collect UFO and UAP reports from military personnel and sensor data and quarantine them away from the rest of the government and military. While he noted that a Pentagon spokesperson has stated no such program exists, Shellenberger recounted prior examples in which the Department of Defense has initially denied knowledge of UAP-related information only to later change its stance and either admit the information exists or release it to the public.\n\n\"The U.S. government appears to know significantly more about UAPs than it is revealing,\" Shellenberger said at the hearing. \"But even those who believe the U.S. government has revealed all that it knows should have no objection to Congressional demands for greater transparency.\"\n\nTo conclude the meeting, Rep. Mace asked each of the witnesses to define what non-human biologics or non-human intelligence mean to each of them.\n\n\"I don't think it's a stretch, when you look at the diversity of life on this planet and the size of this universe, to think that there will be more diverse, higher-order, non-human intelligence throughout the universe, and that's probably what's visiting us,\" Gallaudet said.\n\nElizondo stated he would take a scientific approach: \"The definition would be the ability to react to a stimulus in a manner that requires an intellectual thought process.\"\n\nGold, meanwhile, questioned whether non-human intelligence necessarily implies life, suggesting sophisticated artificial intelligence might be responsible for some UAP encounters. Shellenberger simply stated he did not know what they might be.\n\nIn the hearing, as in other UFO hearings, there was a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. One of the core tenets of these whistleblower testimonies is that much of the credible UFO data is classified and can't be revealed to the public based on the military capabilities that some of that data could reveal.\n\nWhistleblowers have attested for years that, because advanced or classified sensors and satellites sometimes capture footage or photos of unexplained phenomena or advanced craft, those photos or videos are likewise classified by the U.S. government in order to not reveal America's full surveillance or sensing capabilities.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 when U.S. military aircraft shot down a mysterious object off the coast of Alaska. The American government has yet to release any imagery from the event, but a Canadian freedom of information request unveiled a photograph earlier this year of a balloon-like object.\n\nThose incidents and others like it, such as a weeks-long drone incursion above Langley Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., were discussed in the hearing. \"The origin of these drones and their operators remains a mystery,\" Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said. \"This incident and other sightings near sensitive military installations highlights the complexity of the UAP challenge facing our intelligence, defense and homeland security committees.\"\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

        "article_content": "The Pentagon announced they solved one of the most famous UFO videos that sparked a wave of national interest and speculation when it was first released in 2017.\n\nAn official from the Pentagon testified to Congress Tuesday about the wildly popular \u201cGOFAST\u201d video, saying that the attention was unwarranted for the footage once considered to be some of the best evidence of the reality of unidentified flying objects.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said the object captured off the Florida coast by a Navy fighter jet appears to be moving so fast because of the perspectival phenomenon of a parallax.\n\nA screengrab from the famous \u201cGOFAST\u201d video, which shows an infrared radar depiction of an\n\nobject that remains unidentified by the Pentagon, but which is no longer considered anomalous. AARO / SWNS\n\n\u201cThrough a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\u201d Kosloski testified during an oversight hearing.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski heads up AARO, the agency tasked with finding explanations for anomalous activity of presumed UAPs. C-SPAN\n\nKosloski did not, however, identify the object in the \u201cGOFAST\u201d video. He says AARO will make the report on their parallax claims public on their official website.\n\nThe \u201cGOFAST\u201d video shows a radar recording of an object that appeared to be moving at an incredibly high speed, not far above the water.\n\nForward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology was used by fighter jet pilots operating off of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nA radar operator in a jet is forced to manually lock onto the target which was evading the automatic\n\nsystems that usually function without human input. AARO / SWNS\n\nThe FLIR radar shows a small blip on the screen moving so quickly that the operating officer was forced to lock onto the target manually.\n\nWhen the radar operator is finally able to lock onto the moving target, he yells, \u201cWhoa! Got him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the f\u2013k is that?,\u201d someone is heard saying over the radio in the video.\n\n\u201cWow, what is that man? Look at it fly!,\u201d another is heard saying.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. DOD\n\nDespite dashing some hopes of UFO and UAP enthusiasts, Kosloski testified to Congress that there are 21 cases that are still unsolvable.\n\nOne such case involved a law enforcement officer \u201cout West\u201d who saw a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the round.\n\nThe officer reports approaching the \u201cblacker than black object\u201d that was about the size of a Toyota Prius.\n\nWhen the officer got within 100 feet of the object, it shot up into the sky at a 45 degree angle at an improbably fast pace, according to Kosloski\u2019s testimony.\n\nA radar image from another famous UAP incident, commonly referred to as the \u201cGIMBAL\u201d video,\n\nwhich was also recorded of the east coast of the United States by operators working off air craft\n\ncarriers USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt. AARO / SWNS\n\nIn yet another inexplicable event, two government contractors in the Southeast reported seeing a \u201clarge metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane\u201d hovering in the air motionless for 15-20 seconds, according to the testimony Tuesday.\n\n\u201cObviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it\u2019s a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can\u2019t explain how that would happen,\u201d Kosloski told Congress.\n\nAt a hearing last week, UAP and UFO community whistleblowers testified to congress that they were aware of secret research programs conducted by the US government that included crash recoveries and highly secretive back-engineering programs."

Gemini on new Android devices.\n\nThis could let Gemini act as an AI agent on your phone, which is something Google originally promised the Pixel 4\u2019s new Google Assistant would do.\n\nGoogle is giving everything it has to make its Gemini chatbot and large language model more successful, including integrating it across its entire product suite. On Android, Gemini has become the default assistant service on many devices, and the number of things it can do continues to grow with each update. While Gemini can interact with some external services, its ability to control Android apps is very limited at the moment. However, that could change in a big way with next year\u2019s Android 16 release, which is set to include a new API that lets services like Gemini perform actions on behalf of users inside applications.\n\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nGemini Extensions are how Google\u2019s chatbot currently interacts with external services. Extensions give Gemini access to web services like Google Flights, Google Hotels, OpenStax, and more, allowing it to pull in data from these services when you ask it relevant questions. There are also extensions for things like Google Maps, Google Home, YouTube, and Google Workspace, all of which are available as apps on Android. However, these extensions let the chatbot use your account data when calling the backend APIs for these services rather than directly controlling the respective Android apps. Finally, there are some extensions like Utilities that do let Gemini control Android apps directly, but they only let the chatbot perform basic actions using well-defined intents.\n\nThe problem with Gemini Extensions is that they aren\u2019t scalable. There are far too many Android apps for Google to make extensions for, not to mention the fact that many apps don\u2019t provide public APIs that Gemini can even tap into. Using a combination of technologies like screen reading, multimodal AI, and accessibility input, Gemini could theoretically let users control any Android app through natural language, but the results likely wouldn\u2019t be very good given the lack of context. A better solution is for Google to provide an API that lets apps work directly with Gemini to execute certain app functionality, which is exactly what Google looks to be doing in Android 16.\n\nWhen Google released Android 16 DP1 earlier this week, we spotted a mysterious set of new APIs in Google\u2019s developer docs related to a new feature called \u201capp functions.\u201d According to Google\u2019s documentation an app function \u201cis a specific piece of functionality that an app offers to the system.\u201d These functionalities can be \u201cintegrated into various system features.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s description of app functions is vague, likely intentionally so, but thankfully, the description of one of the new methods offers an example of an app function. The method description talks about how function identifiers have to be unique within apps, and that, \u201cfor example, a function to order food could be identified as \u2018orderFood.\u2019\u201d So, for example, a restaurant app could implement an app function to order food, or a hotel app could implement an app function to book a room.\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nDetails are limited, but it seems like apps create functions by defining a service that can only be bound to by a system process. These app functions are exposed to Android\u2019s App Search framework, which is the framework that powers the universal search experience in the Pixel Launcher, among other things. App functions can be executed by apps that hold either the EXECUTE_APP_FUNCTIONS or the EXECUTE_APP_FUNCTIONS_TRUSTED permission in Android 16.\n\nWhile both permissions can only be granted to system applications, the former is currently only granted to system apps that hold the ASSISTANT role (i.e. the Google app), while the latter is currently only granted to system apps that hold the SYSTEM_UI_INTELLIGENCE role (i.e. Android System Intelligence). Both permissions allow applications to \u201cperform actions on behalf of users inside of applications,\u201d but \u201capps contributing app functions can opt to disallow callers with the\u201d EXECUTE_APP_FUNCTIONS permission, instead only allowing callers with the EXECUTE_APP_FUNCTIONS_TRUSTED permission to execute them.\n\nAlthough a lot of details are missing, it sounds to me like Android 16\u2019s new app functions feature will let Gemini control apps in a way that Google Assistant never managed to do. Back in 2019, Google teased how its \u201cnew Google Assistant\u201d could orchestrate tasks across apps. You could use your voice to multitask across apps and perform complex actions like replying to an incoming text via voice, and then following up by sending a photo.\n\nWhat Google unveiled back in 2019 sounded a lot like what AI agents today promise to do, and given everything Google has been working on this past year, it shouldn\u2019t be shocking to hear Google revisit this idea. Hopefully, app functions in Android 16 enable Gemini to become a true AI agent for your Android phone, but from what we can see, that will depend on whether or not app developers get on board with the idea.\n\nGot a tip?

        "article_content": "Alden Ehrenreich is known for playing a Young Han Solo but got his start playing a small role in the paranormal drama Supernatural.\n\nActor Alden Ehrenreich is best known for playing the role of Young Han Solo in the ill-fated 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. He also had an important supporting role in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer. However, before establishing himself as one of the most promising talents in Hollywood, Ehrenreich got his start in a rather small role.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich played Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story (Credit: Lucasfilm).\n\nEhrenreich made his acting debut appearing in an episode of the hit paranormal drama series Supernatural, starring Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Moreover, given the show\u2019s fifteen-season run, the episode Ehrenreich featured in is easy to forget despite being an extremely underrated outing for the Winchester brothers, and here is everything you need to know in that regard.\n\nSolo Star Alden Ehrenreich Got His Start on Supernatural With Jensen Ackles\n\nAlden Ehrenreich\u2018s first acting credit was on the second episode of Supernatural. The actor was only fifteen years old when appeared in the role of Billy Collins in the episode Wendigo. In the episode, the Winchester brothers help siblings Haley and Ben find their missing older brother Tommy.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich made his debut on Supernatural (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nThe episode marks the first instance in the series where Sam and Dean, played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki encounter a monster instead of a spirit or a demon. It sees Ackles and Padalecki teaming up with Ehrenreich\u2019s character, leading to some intense and some outright goofy moments.\n\nThe episode\u2019s tonal inconsistencies can be chalked up to the fact that it was the show\u2019s second episode, with most of its lore and character dynamics yet to be set up. Nonetheless, the entire cast, including a young Ehrenreich delivered commendable performances, earning the episode a modest 7.8/10 rating on IMDB.\n\nEhrenreich was later cast in the role of Han Solo for the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story, taking over the iconic role from Harrison Ford. Despite the film\u2019s mixed reception, Ehrenreich\u2019s performance was largely praised. He is next slated to appear in the MCU series Ironheart.\n\nSupernatural Has a Long-Standing Connection to the Star Wars Franchise\n\nAside from Ehrenreich, actress Emily Swallow has also appeared in both Supernatural and the Star Wars universe. She played Amara in the former before appearing as The Armorer in The Mandalorian. However, the connection between the two brands does not end there.\n\nSupernatural has many Star Wars easter eggs (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nOne of the biggest links between the two lies in the lead characters\u2019 names. According to creator Eric Kripke, the brothers\u2019 last name was originally supposed to be Harrison, as an ode to Harrison Ford. However, the name had to be changed because of legal reasons.\n\nRelated The Supernatural Episode Everyone Forgets Freddy Krueger Star Robert Englund Was in\n\nAn easter egg referencing the names was dropped in the show with Sam and Dean using fake U.S. Wildlife Service badges. In an episode, the duo used these fake badges with the names Agent Ford and Agent Hamill. Kripke later confirmed that Sam and Dean were loosely inspired by Luke & Han.\n\nSupernatural is streaming on Netflix."

Astronomers have just discovered a new planet, and yes, it\u2019s one more name to add to those already tricky lists of planets. This one\u2019s called IRAS 04125+2902 b, and it\u2019s a baby planet- 3 million years old. While that sounds pretty old in planet years, it\u2019s actually still in the early stages of life. But what\u2019s even cooler is how astronomers found it: they got lucky with a rare chance to see it in action as it passed in front of its star, a phenomenon known as a transit.\n\nAlso Read NASA brings AI to space science, these areas to get biggest boost\n\nNormally, when planets are still babies, they\u2019re hidden behind thick clouds of space dust and debris. But this planet is special. Its surrounding debris disk has been warped in a way that allows telescopes, like TESS (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), to see it from Earth.\n\nLocated about 430 light-years away in a region called the Taurus Molecular Cloud, IRAS 04125+2902 b is in a stellar nursery, where new stars and planets are being born. The planet itself is still hot from the heat of its formation, and while it\u2019s smaller than Jupiter, it\u2019s still big enough to be seen as it passes across the face of its star. This is an incredible discovery because it helps scientists learn more about how planets form and what happens to them in the first few million years of their life.\n\nAlso Read India\u2019s push to establish an Earth Observation Satellite ecosystem through Public Private Partnership IN-SPACe taps DoT to cut spectrum price for Spacetech startups Oppo Find X8, X8 Pro launching globally on November 21 with MediaTek Dimensity 9400 and ColorOS 15 Govt to act as a VC fund for pushing space startups\n\nThe planet is likely to be very different from the ones we know in our solar system. It could turn into a \u201cmini-Neptune\u201d or even a \u201csuper-Earth\u201d\u2014types of planets that are actually pretty common in our galaxy, but not in our own solar system.\n\nFor now, scientists are still figuring out what caused the planet\u2019s surrounding debris disk to warp. Some theories suggest the planet might have moved closer to its star, or maybe a hidden companion star could be pulling on the disk. Regardless of the cause, this discovery is giving us an exciting look at the early stages of planetary life."

        "article_content": "It was 1996, and Masashi Yanagisawa was on the brink of his next discovery.\n\nThe Japanese scientist had arrived at the University of Texas Southwestern 5 years earlier, setting up his own lab at age 31. After earning his medical degree, he\u2019d gained notoriety as a PhD student when he discovered endothelin, the body\u2019s most potent vasoconstrictor.\n\nYanagisawa was about to prove this wasn\u2019t a first-timer\u2019s fluke.\n\nHis focus was G-protein\u2013coupled receptors, or GPCRs, cell surface receptors that respond to a range of molecules and a popular target for drug discovery. The Human Genome Project had just revealed a slew of newly discovered receptors, or \u201corphan\u201d GPCRs, and identifying an activating molecule could yield a new drug. (That vasoconstrictor endothelin was one such success story, leading to four new drug approvals in the United States over the past quarter century.)\n\nYanagisawa and his team created 50 cell lines, each expressing one orphan receptor. They applied animal tissue to every line, along with a calcium-sensitive dye. If the cells glowed under the microscope, they had a hit.\n\nJon Willie, MD, PhD\n\n\u201cHe was basically doing an elaborate fishing expedition,\u201d says Jon Willie, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurosurgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who would later join Yanagisawa\u2019s team.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the neon-green fluorescence signaled a match. After isolating the activating molecule, the scientists realized they were dealing with two neuropeptides.\n\nNo one had ever seen these proteins before. And no one knew their discovery would set off a decades-long journey that would finally solve a century-old medical mystery \u2014 and may even fix one of the biggest health crises of our time, as revealed by research published just this year. It\u2019s a story of strange coincidences, serendipitous discoveries, and quirky details. Most of all, it\u2019s a fascinating example of how basic science can revolutionize medicine \u2014 and how true breakthroughs happen over time and in real time.\n\nBut That\u2019s Basic Science for You\n\nMost basic science studies \u2014 the early, foundational research that provides the building blocks for science that follows \u2014 don\u2019t lead to medical breakthroughs. But some do, often in surprising ways.\n\nAlso called curiosity-driven research, basic science aims to fill knowledge gaps to keep science moving, even if the trajectory isn\u2019t always clear.\n\n\u201cThe people working on the basic research that led to discoveries that transformed the modern world had no idea at the time,\u201d says Isobel Ronai, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in life sciences at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cOften, these stories can only be seen in hindsight,\u201d sometimes decades later.\n\nCase in point: For molecular biology techniques \u2014 things like DNA sequencing and gene targeting \u2014 the lag between basic science and breakthrough is, on average, 23 years. While many of the resulting techniques have received Nobel Prizes, few of the foundational discoveries have been awarded such accolades.\n\n\u201cThe scientific glory is more often associated with the downstream applications,\u201d says Ronai. \u201cThe importance of basic research can get lost. But it is the foundation for any future application, such as drug development.\u201d\n\nAs funding is increasingly funneled toward applied research, basic science can require a certain persistence. What this under-appreciation can obscure is the pathway to discovery \u2014 which is often as compelling as the end result, full of unpredictable twists, turns, and even interpersonal intrigue.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the fascinating \u2014 and definitely complicated \u2014 phenomenon of multiple independent discoveries.\n\nAs in: What happens when two independent teams discover the same thing at the same time?\n\nBack to Yanagisawa\u2019s Lab...\n\n\u2026where he and his team learned a few things about those new neuropeptides. Rat brain studies pinpointed the lateral hypothalamus as the peptides\u2019 area of activity \u2014 a region often called the brain\u2019s feeding center.\n\nMasashi Yanagisawa\n\n\u201cIf you destroy that part of the brain, animals lose appetite,\u201d says Yanagisawa. So these peptides must control feeding, the scientists thought.\n\nSure enough, injecting the proteins into rat brains led the rodents to start eating.\n\nSatisfied, the team named them \u201corexin-A\u201d and \u201corexin-B,\u201d for the Greek word \u201corexis,\u201d meaning appetite. The brain receptors became \u201corexin-1\u201d and \u201corexin-2.\u201d The team prepared to publish its findings in Cell.\n\nBut another group beat them to it.\n\nIntroducing the \u2018Hypocretins\u2019\n\nIn early January 1998, a team of Scripps Research Institute scientists, led by J. Gregor Sutcliffe, PhD, released a paper in the journal PNAS. They described a gene encoding for the precursor to two neuropeptides.\n\nThomas Kilduff, PhD\n\nAs the peptides were in the hypothalamus and structurally like secretin (a gut hormone), they called them \u201chypocretins.\u201d The hypocretin peptides excited neurons in the hypothalamus, and later that year, the scientists discovered that the neurons\u2019 branches extended, tentacle-like, throughout the brain. \u201cMany of the connected areas were involved in sleep-wake control,\u201d says Thomas Kilduff, PhD, who joined the Sutcliffe lab just weeks before the hypocretin discovery. At the time, however, the significance of this finding was not yet clear.\n\nWeeks later, in February 1998, Yanagisawa\u2019s paper came out.\n\nSomehow, two groups, over 1000 miles apart, had stumbled on the same neuropeptides at the same time.\n\n\u201cI first heard about [Yanagisawa\u2019s] paper on NBC Nightly News,\u201d recalls Kilduff. \u201cI was skiing in the mountains, so I had to wait until Monday to get back to the lab to see what the paper was all about.\u201d\n\nHe realized that Yanagisawa\u2019s orexin was his lab\u2019s hypocretin, although the study didn\u2019t mention another team\u2019s discovery.\n\n\u201cThere may have been accusations. But as far as I know, it\u2019s because [Yanagisawa] didn\u2019t know [about the other paper],\u201d says Willie. \u201cThis was not something he produced in 2 months. This was clearly years of work.\u201d\n\n\u2018Multiple Discovery\u2019 Happens More Often Than You Think\n\nIn the mid-20th century, sociologist Robert Merton described the phenomenon of \u201cmultiple discovery,\u201d where many scientific discoveries or inventions are made independently at roughly the same time.\n\n\u201cThis happens much more frequently in scientific research than people suppose,\u201d says David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate\u2019s Institute for Scientific Information, the analytics company\u2019s research arm. (Last year, Pendlebury flagged the hypocretin/orexin discovery for Clarivate\u2019s prestigious Citations Laureates award, an honor that aims to predict, often successfully, who will go on to win the Nobel Prize.)\n\n\u201cPeople have this idea of the lone researcher making a brilliant discovery,\u201d Pendlebury says. \u201cBut more and more, teams find things at the same time.\u201d\n\nWhile this can \u2014 and does \u2014 lead to squabbling about who deserves credit, the desire to be first can also be highly motivating, says Mike Schneider, PhD, an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, who studies the social dynamics of science, potentially leading to faster scientific advancement.\n\nThe downside? If two groups produce the same or similar results, but one publishes first, scientific journals tend to reject the second, citing a lack of novelty.\n\nYet duplicating research is a key step in confirming the validity of a discovery.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in 2018, the journal PLOS Biology created a provision for \u201cscooped\u201d scientists, allowing them to submit their paper within 6 months of the first as a complementary finding. Instead of viewing this as redundancy, the editors believe it adds robustness to the research.\n\n\u2018What the Heck Is This Mouse Doing?\u2019\n\nEven though he\u2019d been scooped, Yanagisawa forged on to the next challenge: Confirming whether orexin regulated feeding.\n\nHe began breeding mice missing the orexin gene. His team expected these \u201cknockout\u201d mice to eat less, resulting in a thinner body than other rodents. To the contrary, \u201cthey were on average fatter,\u201d says Willie. \u201cThey were eating less but weighed more, indicating a slower metabolism.\u201d\n\nThe researchers were befuddled. \u201cWe were really disappointed, almost desperate about what to do,\u201d recalls Yanagisawa.\n\nAs nocturnal animals eat more at night, he decided they should study the mice after dark. One of his students, Richard Chemelli, MD, bought an infrared video camera from Radio Shack, filming the first 4 hours of the mice\u2019s active period for several nights.\n\nAfter watching the footage, \u201cRick called me and said, \u2018Let\u2019s get into the lab,\u2019\u201d says Willie. \u201cIt was four of us on a Saturday looking at these videos, saying, \u2018What the heck is this mouse doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile exploring their habitat, the knockout mice would randomly fall over, pop back up after a minute or so, and resume normal activity. This happened over and over \u2014 and the scientists were unsure why.\n\nThey began monitoring the mice\u2019s brains during these episodes \u2014 and made a startling discovery.\n\nThe mice weren\u2019t having seizures. They were shifting directly into REM sleep, bypassing the non-REM stage, then quickly toggling back to wake mode.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew these animals had something akin to narcolepsy,\u201d says Willie.\n\nThe team recruited Thomas Scammell, MD, a Harvard neurologist, to investigate whether modafinil \u2014 an anti-narcoleptic drug without a clear mechanism \u2014 affected orexin neurons.\n\nTwo hours after injecting the mice with the medication, the scientists sacrificed them and stained their brains. Remarkably, the number of neurons showing orexin activity had increased ninefold. It seemed modafinil worked by activating the orexin system.\n\nThese findings had the potential to crack open the science of narcolepsy, one of the most mysterious sleep disorders.\n\nUnless, of course, another team did it first.\n\nThe Mystery of Narcolepsy\n\nYet another multiple discovery, narcolepsy was first described by two scientists \u2014 one in Germany, the other in France \u2014 within a short span in the late 1800s.\n\nIt would be more than a hundred years before anyone understood the disorder\u2019s cause, even though it affects about 1 in 2000 people.\n\n\u201cPatients were often labeled as lazy and malingerers,\u201d says Kilduff, \u201csince they were sleepy all the time and had this weird motor behavior called cataplexy\u201d or the sudden loss of muscle tone.\n\nIn the early 1970s, William Dement, MD, PhD \u2014 \u201cthe father of sleep medicine\u201d \u2014 was searching for a narcoleptic cat to study. He couldn\u2019t find a feline, but several colleagues mentioned dogs with narcolepsy-like symptoms.\n\nDement, who died in 2020, had found his newest research subjects.\n\nIn 1973, he started a narcoleptic dog colony at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. At first, he focused on poodles and beagles. After discovering their narcolepsy wasn\u2019t genetic, he pivoted to dobermans and labradors. Their narcolepsy was inherited, so he could breed them to populate the colony.\n\nAlthough human narcolepsy is rarely genetic, it\u2019s otherwise a lot like the version in these dogs.\n\nBoth involve daytime sleepiness, \u201cpathological\u201d bouts of REM sleep, and the loss of muscle tone in response to emotions, often positive ones.\n\nThe researchers hoped the canines could unlock a treatment for human narcolepsy. They began laying out a path of dog kibble, then injecting the dogs with drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They wanted to see what might help them stay awake as they excitedly chowed down.\n\nKilduff also started a molecular genetics program, trying to identify the genetic defect behind canine narcolepsy. But after a parvovirus outbreak, Kilduff resigned from the project, drained from the strain of seeing so many dogs die.\n\nA decade after his departure from the dog colony, his work would dramatically intersect with that of his successor, Emmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD.\n\n\u201cI thought I had closed the narcolepsy chapter in my life forever,\u201d says Kilduff. \u201cThen in 1998, we described this novel neuropeptide, hypocretin, that turned out to be the key to understanding the disorder.\u201d\n\nNarcoleptic Dogs in California, Mutant Mice in Texas\n\nEmmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD\n\nIt was modafinil \u2014 the same anti-narcoleptic drug Yanagisawa\u2019s team studied \u2014 that brought Emmanuel Mignot to the United States. After training as a pharmacologist in France, his home country sent him to Stanford to study the drug, which was discovered by French scientists, as his required military service.\n\nAs Kilduff\u2019s replacement at the dog colony, his goal was to figure out how modafinil worked, hoping to attract a US company to develop the drug.\n\nThe plan succeeded. Modafinil became Provigil, a billion-dollar narcolepsy drug, and Mignot became \u201ccompletely fascinated\u201d with the disorder.\n\n\u201cI realized quickly that there was no way we\u2019d find the cause of narcolepsy by finding the mode of action of this drug,\u201d Mignot says. \u201cMost likely, the drug was acting downstream, not at the cause of the disorder.\u201d\n\nTo discover the answer, he needed to become a geneticist. And so began his 11-year odyssey to find the cause of canine narcolepsy.\n\nAfter mapping the dog genome, Mignot set out to find the smallest stretch of chromosome that the narcoleptic animals had in common. \u201cFor a very long time, we were stuck with a relatively large region [of DNA],\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a no man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\nWithin that region was the gene for the hypocretin/orexin-2 receptor \u2014 the same receptor that Yanagisawa had identified in his first orexin paper. Mignot didn\u2019t immediately pursue that gene as a possibility \u2014 even though his students suggested it. Why?\n\n\u201cThe decision was simply: Should we lose time to test a possible candidate [gene] among many?\u201d Mignot says.\n\nAs Mignot studied dog DNA in California, Yanagisawa was creating mutant mice in Texas. Unbeknownst to either scientist, their work was about to converge.\n\nWhat Happened Next Is Somewhat Disputed\n\nAfter diagnosing his mice with narcolepsy, Yanagisawa opted not to share this finding with Mignot, though he knew about Mignot\u2019s interest in the condition. Instead, he asked a colleague to find out how far along Mignot was in his genetics research.\n\nAccording to Yanagisawa, his colleague didn\u2019t realize how quickly DNA sequencing could happen once a target gene was identified. At a sleep meeting, \u201che showed Emmanuel all of our raw data. Almost accidentally, he disclosed our findings,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a shock for me.\u201d\n\nUnsure whether he was part of the orexin group, Mignot decided not to reveal that he\u2019d identified the hypocretin/orexin-2 receptor gene as the faulty one in his narcoleptic dogs.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t share this finding, Mignot says he did offer to speak with the lead researcher to see if their findings were the same. If they were, they could jointly submit their articles. But Mignot never heard back.\n\nMeanwhile, back at his lab, Mignot buckled down. While he wasn\u2019t convinced the mouse data proved anything, it did give him the motivation to move faster.\n\nWithin weeks, he submitted his findings to Cell, revealing a mutation in the hypocretin/orexin-2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy. According to Yanagisawa, the journal\u2019s editor invited him to peer-review the paper, tipping him off to its existence.\n\n\u201cI told him I had a conflict of interest,\u201d says Yanagisawa. \u201cAnd then we scrambled to finish our manuscript. We wrote up the paper within almost 5 days.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, it seemed both papers would be published together in Cell. Instead, on August 6, 1999, Mignot\u2019s study was splashed solo across the journal\u2019s cover.\n\n\u201cAt the time, our team was pissed off, but looking back, what else could Emmanuel have done?\u201d says Willie, who was part of Yanagisawa\u2019s team. \u201cThe grant he\u2019d been working on for years was at risk. He had it within his power to do the final experiments. Of course he was going to finish.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, Yanagisawa\u2019s findings followed, also in Cell.\n\nHis paper proposed knockout mice as a model for human narcolepsy and orexin as a key regulator of the sleep/wake cycle. With orexin-activated neurons branching into other areas of the brain, the peptide seemed to promote wakefulness by synchronizing several arousal neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have orexin, each of those systems can still function, but they\u2019re not as coordinated,\u201d says Willie. \u201cIf you have narcolepsy, you\u2019re capable of wakefulness, and you\u2019re capable of sleep. What you can\u2019t do is prevent inappropriately switching between states.\u201d\n\nTogether, the two papers painted a clear picture: Narcolepsy was the result of a dysfunction in the hypocretin/orexin system.\n\nAfter more than a century, the cause of narcolepsy was starting to come into focus.\n\n\u201cThis was blockbuster,\u201d says Willie.\n\nBy itself, either finding \u2014 one in dogs, one in mice \u2014 might have been met with skepticism. But in combination, they offered indisputable evidence about narcolepsy\u2019s cause.\n\nThe Human Brains in Your Fridge Hold Secrets\n\nJerome Siegel\n\nJerome Siegel had been searching for the cause of human narcolepsy for years. A PhD and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, he had managed to acquire four human narcoleptic brains. As laughter is often the trigger for the sudden shift to REM sleep in humans, he focused on the amygdala, an area linked to emotion.\n\n\u201cI looked in the amygdala and didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the brains stayed in my refrigerator for probably 10 years.\u201d\n\nThen he was invited to review Yanagisawa\u2019s study in Cell. The lightbulb clicked on: Maybe the hypothalamus \u2014 not the amygdala \u2014 was the area of abnormality. He and his team dug out the decade-old brains.\n\nWhen they stained the brains, the massive loss of hypocretin-activated neurons was hard to miss: On average, the narcoleptic brains had only about 7000 of the cells vs 70,000 in the average human brain. The scientists also noticed scar tissue in the hypothalamus, indicating that the neurons had at some point died, rather than being absent from birth.\n\nWhat Siegel didn\u2019t know: Mignot had also acquired a handful of human narcoleptic brains.\n\nAlready, he had coauthored a study showing that hypocretin/orexin was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid of the majority of the people with narcolepsy his team tested. It seemed clear that the hypocretin/orexin system was flawed \u2014 or even broken \u2014 in people with the condition.\n\n\u201cIt looked like the cause of narcolepsy in humans was indeed this lack of orexin in the brain,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hypothesis immediately. To me, this is when we established that narcolepsy in humans was due to a lack of orexin. The next thing was to check that the cells were missing.\u201d\n\nNow he could do exactly that.\n\n\n\nAs expected, Mignot\u2019s team observed a dramatic loss of hypocretin/orexin cells in the narcoleptic brains. They also noticed that a different cell type in the hypothalamus was unaffected. This implied the damage was specific to the hypocretin-activated cells and supported a hunch they already had: That the deficit was the result not of a genetic defect but of an autoimmune attack. (It\u2019s a hypothesis Mignot has spent the last 15 years proving.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a gathering in Hawaii, in late August 2000, that the two realized the overlap of their work.\n\nTo celebrate his team\u2019s finding, Mignot had invited a group of researchers to Big Island. With his paper scheduled for publication on September 1, he felt comfortable presenting his findings to his guests, which included Siegel.\n\nUntil then, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what he had found, and he didn\u2019t know what I had found, which basically was the same thing,\u201d says Siegel.\n\nIn yet another strange twist, the two papers were published just weeks apart, simultaneously revealing that human narcoleptics have a depleted supply of the neurons that bind to hypocretin/orexin. The cause of the disorder was at last a certainty.\n\n\u201cEven if I was first, what does it matter? In the end, you need confirmation,\u201d says Mignot. \u201cYou need multiple people to make sure that it\u2019s true. It\u2019s good science when things like this happen.\u201d\n\nHow All of This Changed Medicine\n\nSince these groundbreaking discoveries, the diagnosis of narcolepsy has become much simpler. Lab tests can now easily measure hypocretin in cerebrospinal fluid, providing a definitive diagnosis.\n\nBut the development of narcolepsy treatments has lagged \u2014 even though hypocretin/orexin replacement therapy is the obvious answer.\n\n\u201cAlmost 25 years have elapsed, and there\u2019s no such therapeutic on the market,\u201d says Kilduff, who now works for SRI International, a non-profit research and development institute.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because agonists \u2014 drugs that bind to receptors in the brain \u2014 are challenging to create, as this requires mimicking the activating molecule\u2019s structure, like copying the grooves of an intricate key.\n\nAntagonists, by comparison, are easier to develop. These act as a gate, blocking access to the receptors. As a result, drugs that promote sleep by thwarting hypocretin/orexin have emerged more quickly, providing a flurry of new options for people with insomnia. The first, suvorexant, was launched in 2014. Two others followed in recent years.\n\nResearchers are hopeful a hypocretin/orexin agonist is on the horizon.\n\n\u201cThis is a very hot area of drug development,\u201d says Kilduff. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s going to get the drug to market first.\u201d\n\nOne More Hypocretin/Orexin Surprise \u2014 and It Could Be The Biggest\n\nSeveral years ago, Siegel\u2019s lab received what was supposed to be a healthy human brain \u2014 one they could use as a comparison for narcoleptic brains. But researcher Thomas Thannickal, PhD, lead author of the UCLA study linking hypocretin loss to human narcolepsy, noticed something strange: This brain had significantly more hypocretin neurons than average.\n\nWas this due to a seizure? A traumatic death? Siegel called the brain bank to request the donor\u2019s records. He was told they were missing.\n\nYears later, Siegel happened to be visiting the brain bank for another project and found himself in a room adjacent to the medical records. \u201cNobody was there,\u201d he says, \u201cso I just opened a drawer.\u201d\n\nShuffling through the brain bank\u2019s files, Siegel found the medical records he\u2019d been told were lost. In the file was a note from the donor, explaining that he was a former heroin addict.\n\n\u201cI almost fell out of my chair,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cI realized this guy\u2019s heroin addiction likely had something to do with his very unusual brain.\u201d\n\nObviously, opioids affected the orexin system. But how?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s when people are happy that this peptide is released,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cThe hypocretin system is not just related to alertness. It\u2019s related to pleasure.\u201d\n\nAs Yanagisawa observed early on, hypocretin/orexin does indeed play a role in eating \u2014 just not the one he initially thought. The peptides prompted pleasure seeking. So the rodents ate.\n\nIn 2018, after acquiring five more brains, Siegel\u2019s group published a study in Science Translational Medicine, showing 54% more detectable hypocretin neurons in the brains of heroin addicts than in those of control individuals.\n\nIn 2022, another breakthrough: His team showed that morphine significantly altered the pathways of hypocretin neurons in mice, sending their axons into brain regions associated with addiction. Then, when they removed the mice\u2019s hypocretin neurons and discontinued their daily morphine dose, the rodents showed no symptoms of opioid withdrawal.\n\nThis fits the connection with narcolepsy: Among the standard treatments for the condition are amphetamines and other stimulants, which all have addictive potential. Yet, \u201cnarcoleptics never abuse these drugs,\u201d Siegel says. \u201cThey seem to be uniquely resistant to addiction.\u201d\n\nThis could powerfully change the way opioids are administered.\n\n\u201cIf you prevent the hypocretin response to opioids, you may be able to prevent opioid addiction,\u201d says Siegel. In other words, blocking the hypocretin system with a drug like those used to treat insomnia may allow patients to experience the pain-relieving benefits of opioids \u2014 without the risk for addiction.\n\nHis team is currently investigating treatments targeting the hypocretin/orexin system for opioid addiction.\n\nIn a study published in July, they found that mice who received suvorexant \u2014 the drug for insomnia \u2014 didn\u2019t anticipate their daily dose of opioids the way other rodents did. This suggests the medication prevented addiction, without diminishing the pain-relieving effect of opioids.\n\nIf it translates to humans, this discovery could potentially save millions of lives.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just us working on this,\u201d says Siegel.\n\nBut with hypocretin/orexin, you never know."

        "article_content": "Tesla battery supplier Panasonic has revamped a plant in Wakayama, Japan, as part of the effort to mass produce what it calls a \"breakthrough\" in the battery and electric vehicle industries, according to a company news release.\n\nThe 4680 cylindrical cell is much bigger and thus \"these new cells possess five times the capacity of the 2170 cell,\" the release said, for starters. The 4680 moniker is in reference to its size of 46 millimeters in diameter by 80 millimeters long (1.8 inches by 3.1 inches), per Bloomberg.\n\nPanasonic bills the 4680 as a clear improvement on its 2170 cells, which are used in the Tesla Model Y and Model 3. The new pack is expected to decrease production costs along with EV prices, according to the Panasonic news release and Electrek.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to New Atlas, the new cells \"do require less supporting material, so they're both lighter and more compact for a given energy capacity,\" referencing a 2020 prediction by Tesla that a cell of the same size could produce a 16% increase in effective range when used in production.\n\nIt's part of a growing list of battery innovations from labs around the planet that involve unique materials, some including potassium and sodium. Researchers at work on those projects share Panasonic's goal of lowering production costs and boosting performance.\n\nThe Wakayama plant is innovative in its own right. Panasonic reports that it will be a \"mother\" plant for 4680 production while also serving as a proving ground for other products. About 400 employees are expected to be working there by March, per the news release.\n\n\"This milestone is the result of years of expertise in cylindrical lithium-ion battery manufacturing,\" Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plant will use solar and wind power to help make operations cleaner. The goal is to eventually reach \"virtually\" zero carbon dioxide emissions, per Panasonic. Cutting heat-trapping gas production is a win for public health, as medical experts link the fumes to a variety of lung, heart, and other health problems.\n\nBetter batteries can help with the effort to clear the air, as well as improve EV performance and pricing.\n\n\"As we add the 4680 cell to our lineup, we'll cater to a broader range of needs, further promoting the use of EVs and advancing our mission of fostering a sustainable society,\" Tadanobu said.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThe expansion is coming at a good time, as EV sales neared 14 million worldwide last year. That's up from more than 10 million in 2022, according to International Energy Agency statistics. Stateside, robust tax breaks worth up to $7,500 are still available, making the cleaner rides even more affordable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf everything goes according to Panasonic's plan, the 4680 cells should soon be a part of some of those EVs.\n\n\"I'm confident it will significantly revolutionize the battery and EV industry,\" Tadanobu said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."
