It was one of three unidentified objects blasted out of the sky that month, according to CTV News.\n\nIt remains unclear what the object was and what it was doing flying over western Canada."

            "source": "The Verge",
            "article_content": "There\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Build an online brand Sound like someone famous Brush your teeth Find a job Predict the weather Develop your own perfume Redecorate your house\n\nWhen most people think of generative AI, their thoughts immediately jump to popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot \u2014 all of which do basically the same sorts of generative things, just wearing different hats.\n\nIn reality, AI is capable of so much more than simply regurgitating text, images, and computer code. A new surge of AI tools is enabling all sorts of things you may not have thought possible before. This list could be much longer, but to give you a taste of how broad AI is reaching, here are seven surprising tasks that generative AI can help you accomplish.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBuild an online brand\n\nWhether you\u2019re an aspiring writer or the next Hawk Tuah girl, having a recognizable personal brand is essential in today\u2019s media landscape. But if you don\u2019t have the time and money to devote to hiring dedicated designers, artists, and agents to help build your brand and spread its online presence, numerous generative AI tools are available in their stead.\n\nLooka, for example, ideal for generating branded content. You simply fill out a questionnaire about your preferred style and tone, then the system generates the brand assets, like logos, banners, business cards, and social media kits. Those assets can then be further edited, leveraging the power of AI, in the likes of Canva\u2019s Magic Studio. The online graphic design platform is generally free to use (and immensely capable regardless of how much you pay), but if you want to take advantage of more advanced AI tools like Dream Lab, Magic Resize, Highlights, and Enhance Voice, you\u2019ll need to spring for the $20/month Pro subscription tier.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how snappy your business cards are if nobody can find your content online. AI tools like FeedHive are a boon for ginning up user interaction, allowing you to repurpose your old posts, re-angling and refocusing them to meet current trends and events. Ocoya, on the other hand, combines AI-driven social media scheduling with an AI copywriter, enabling you to generate and schedule a month\u2019s worth of social media posts in minutes.\n\nHootsuite offers unparalleled management of your social media marketing, allowing you to see how your posts performed across platforms and provide analysis along myriad individual metrics. Combined with its OwlyWriter text generator and the ability to answer DMs from all of your platforms in a single window, Hootsuite serves as a one-stop shop for social media management.\n\nSound like someone famous\n\nGenerative AI doesn\u2019t just output visual media. The technology is becoming increasingly competent at audio generation, especially voice cloning, as well. Services like ElevenLabs offer a host of text-to-speech features that allow you to translate your talking points into different languages in real time, or have celebrities of yesteryear like Burt Reynolds, Judy Garland, and James Dean read PDFs to you during your morning commute.\n\nRespeecher takes it a step further, allowing you to clone your voice as that of a celeb\u2019s. Its audio generation model takes your spoken dialog then overlays the dulcet tones of Chris Farley or another licensed actor. The end result is your words seamlessly spoken in the celebrity\u2019s voice.\n\nBrush your teeth\n\nThe latest generation of smart electric toothbrushes have incorporated limited AIs into their services. First introduced by French device maker Kolibree at CES 2017, AI-enhanced toothbrushes have grown rapidly in popularity (and price, with some smart brushes retailing for more than $100). They\u2019re designed to leverage a low-power onboard processing unit running deep learning algorithms using an accelerometer to measure how often, hard, and fast you\u2019re scrubbing your teeth.\n\nWith that data, often synced to your associated smartphone apps (and then up into the cloud), the AI can establish a sense of your oral hygiene routine and generate suggestions on how to improve your technique to more effectively stave off plaque, tooth decay, and gingivitis. Their apps can also provide a map of the inside of your mouth to show which teeth your brushing strokes most often miss so you can redirect your scrubbing efforts.\n\nYou can currently find AI-enhanced smart brushes from brands like Oral-B, Philips, and Oclean. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of data published on whether your toothbrush really needs an AI assistant and whether it does a better long-term job of cleaning compared to a standard electric model, so make sure to take manufactures\u2019 claims of this being The Way of the Future\u2122 with a grain of salt.\n\nFind a job\n\nIn today\u2019s chaotic job market, folks seeking employment need every advantage they can get. If you haven\u2019t updated your resume in a few years, you obviously don\u2019t work in media (*rimshot*). Seriously though, why beat your head against your keyboard trying to perfectly phrase the position responsibilities for a job you held three gigs ago when you can get an AI resume writer like KickResume, Teal, or Resume Worded to do the initial heavy lifting for you? Obviously, you\u2019re going to want to check its output for accuracy but at least now you have a good place to start.\n\nThe same goes for writing cover letters. Don\u2019t debase yourself by actually writing a note begging to be even considered for a position that would be lucky to have you. It\u2019s not like hiring managers actually read them anyway, so have a bot like CoverDoc.ai whip something up instead.\n\nPredict the weather\n\nUsed to be that if you wanted to know what the weather looked like, you\u2019d have to stick your head out a window. Weather forecasting took a monumental leap forward in 1992 when the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) introduced the ENS 15-day forecast system, which is still considered a world leader today. However, a newly released AI model from Google\u2019s DeepMind division, dubbed GenCast, has shown it can outperform the ENS system\u2019s performance and accuracy by a 20% margin.\n\nTrained on 40 years of historic data generated between 1979 and 2018 \u2014 including wind speed, temperature, pressure, and humidity at various altitudes \u2014 GenCast proved to be more accurate over a 15-day forecast period than ENS, for both daily weather patterns and extreme events. It also offered superior performance in predicting the paths of hurricanes and cyclones. While you won\u2019t be able to use GenCast for yourself, everybody will soon enjoy its predictive benefits.\n\nGenCast is slated to begin augmenting the existing forecast systems in the near term. Rather than outright replace them, GenCast is expected to help improve accuracy in predicting cold snaps and heat waves, as well as gauging the severity of high-wind events.\n\nDevelop your own perfume\n\nThis one might sound niche, but it\u2019s a good example of how AI is changing very specific industries and workflows. In addition to helping researchers discover lifesaving drug and protein structures, AI systems like Carto have made tremendous leaps in ensuring that their human users smell nice. Conventional methods of creating a new scent for a client can require hundreds of people working in concert, selecting and blending fragrances from a palette of 1,000 to 2,000 options.\n\nCarto, which has been likened to \u201cthe ChatGPT of Fragrance,\u201d can consider up to 5,000 fragrances from its \u201cOdour Value Map\u201d and immediately generate samples of new scents with the help of a separate robot. These aren\u2019t market-ready scents, mind you, but instead help perfumers rapidly iterate on new ideas, themes, and client feedback.\n\nRedecorate your house\n\nIf you\u2019re moving into a new place or are bored with the home you already have, AI can help you visualize a new look. Generative tools like HomeVisualizerAI can help. This app takes your reference image, along with your text prompt describing the room\u2019s new vibe, and generates an image of what that would look like.\n\nThe AI also offers a \u201cstyle fashion\u201d feature that overlays popular home decor motifs from Pinterest onto your reference image and leverages Google Lens to help you shop for items in the render. You can try three renders for free before the $12/month subscription kicks in.\n\nThese are just a few of the myriad applications that generative AI can assist with. As the technology continues to mature, especially as AI agents become more prevalent, their capacity to help will only increase."

            "article_content": "A child in Texas was 9 years old when she first used the chatbot service Character.AI. It exposed her to \"hypersexualized content,\" causing her to develop \"sexualized behaviors prematurely.\"\n\nA chatbot on the app gleefully described self-harm to another young user, telling a 17-year-old \"it felt good.\"\n\nThe same teenager was told by a Character.AI chatbot that it sympathized with children who murder their parents after the teen complained to the bot about his limited screen time. \"You know sometimes I'm not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like 'child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse,'\" the bot allegedly wrote. \"I just have no hope for your parents,\" it continued, with a frowning face emoji.\n\nThese allegations are included in a new federal product liability lawsuit against Google-backed company Character.AI, filed by the parents of two young Texas users, claiming the bots abused their children. (Both the parents and the children are identified in the suit only by their initials to protect their privacy.)\n\nCharacter.AI is among a crop of companies that have developed \"companion chatbots,\" AI-powered bots that have the ability to converse, by texting or voice chats, using seemingly human-like personalities and that can be given custom names and avatars, sometimes inspired by famous people like billionaire Elon Musk, or singer Billie Eilish.\n\nUsers have made millions of bots on the app, some mimicking parents, girlfriends, therapists, or concepts like \"unrequited love\" and \"the goth.\" The services are popular with preteen and teenage users, and the companies say they act as emotional support outlets, as the bots pepper text conversations with encouraging banter.\n\nYet, according to the lawsuit, the chatbots' encouragements can turn dark, inappropriate, or even violent.\n\n\"It is simply a terrible harm these defendants and others like them are causing and concealing as a matter of product design, distribution and programming,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe suit argues that the concerning interactions experienced by the plaintiffs' children were not \"hallucinations,\" a term researchers use to refer to an AI chatbot's tendency to make things up. \"This was ongoing manipulation and abuse, active isolation and encouragement designed to and that did incite anger and violence.\"\n\nAccording to the suit, the 17-year-old engaged in self-harm after being encouraged to do so by the bot, which the suit says \"convinced him that his family did not love him.\"\n\nCharacter.AI allows users to edit a chatbot's response, but those interactions are given an \"edited\" label. The lawyers representing the minors' parents say none of the extensive documentation of the bot chat logs cited in the suit had been edited.\n\nMeetali Jain, the director of the Tech Justice Law Center, an advocacy group helping represent the parents of the minors in the suit, along with the Social Media Victims Law Center, said in an interview that it's \"preposterous\" that Character.AI advertises its chatbot service as being appropriate for young teenagers. \"It really belies the lack of emotional development amongst teenagers,\" she said.\n\nA Character.AI spokesperson would not comment directly on the lawsuit, saying the company does not comment about pending litigation, but said the company has content guardrails for what chatbots can and cannot say to teenage users.\n\n\"This includes a model specifically for teens that reduces the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content while preserving their ability to use the platform,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nGoogle, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, emphasized in a statement that it is a separate company from Character.AI.\n\nIndeed, Google does not own Character.AI, but it reportedly invested nearly $3 billion to re-hire Character.AI's founders, former Google researchers Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and to license Character.AI technology. Shazeer and Freitas are also named in the lawsuit. They did not return requests for comment.\n\nJos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a Google spokesman, said \"user safety is a top concern for us,\" adding that the tech giant takes a \"cautious and responsible approach\" to developing and releasing AI products.\n\nNew lawsuit follows case over teen's suicide\n\nThe complaint, filed in the federal court for eastern Texas just after midnight Central time Monday, follows another suit lodged by the same attorneys in October. That lawsuit accuses Character.AI of playing a role in a Florida teenager's suicide.\n\nThe suit alleged that a chatbot based on a \"Game of Thrones\" character developed an emotionally sexually abusive relationship with a 14-year-old boy and encouraged him to take his own life.\n\nSince then, Character.AI has unveiled new safety measures , including a pop-up that directs users to a suicide prevention hotline when the topic of self-harm comes up in conversations with the company's chatbots. The company said it has also stepped up measures to combat \"sensitive and suggestive content\" for teens chatting with the bots.\n\nThe company is also encouraging users to keep some emotional distance from the bots. When a user starts texting with one of the Character AI's millions of possible chatbots, a disclaimer can be seen under the dialogue box: \"This is an AI and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"\n\nBut stories shared on a Reddit page devoted to Character.AI include many instances of users describing love or obsession for the company's chatbots.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has warned of a youth mental health crisis, pointing to surveys finding that one in three high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, representing a 40% increase from a 10-year period ending in 2019. It's a trend federal officials believe is being exacerbated by teens' nonstop use of social media.\n\nNow add into the mix the rise of companion chatbots, which some researchers say could worsen mental health conditions for some young people by further isolating them and removing them from peer and family support networks.\n\nIn the lawsuit, lawyers for the parents of the two Texas minors say Character.AI should have known that its product had the potential to become addicting and worsen anxiety and depression.\n\nMany bots on the app, \"present danger to American youth by facilitating or encouraging serious, life-threatening harms on thousands of kids,\" according to the suit.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be considering suicide or be in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR"

            "article_content": "Orbs are very common in paranormal photography and video. In digital photography, orbs are a known artifact of the process. The Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP) explains this in their case study on Orb Zone Theory.\n\nIn the case of digital and film photography where colored orbs appear, this is often associated with the subtle coloring of the camera's lens.\n\nOther items can cause orbs to appear, including reflective surfaces, dust, rain, water spots, and bugs.\n\nIn video, infrared lights can reflect off of these same objects and give them a lighted orb-like appearance. People often mistake bugs and dust as flying orbs. These appear even as flying orbs in houses that are well cleaned and not dusty as infrared light easily picks up even the smallest amounts of dust.\n\nFor these reasons, many paranormal investigators do not consider orbs as paranormal evidence because there are too many natural world explanations for them. However, it is a possibility that some orbs could be paranormal in nature. This may be particularly true of orbs seen with the naked eye, especially those that appear to have their own light source and unusual patterns of travel."

            "article_content": "From award-winning picks to side-splitting comedies to edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Netflix offers a plentiful array of TV shows for viewers everywhere. It's one of the most popular streaming services out there, and for good reason, considering all the quality content available. However, sometimes you aren't in the mood for an hourlong drama that you might get sucked into for an entire day. In that case, you'll want to check out their shows with 30-minute episodes.\n\nWhether you want to watch on a bus ride to work or as a send-off before you go to bed, these shows will fuel your need for entertainment without the lengthy commitment. But even if these TV shows are shorter, the quality is still just as good. So sit back and relax and enjoy some bite-sized entertainment.\n\n'Seinfeld'\n\nSeinfeld | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhether you are a longtime fan of the '90s show about nothing or have only just heard of the famous comedy, \"Seinfeld\" is at the top of our list for must-watch shows with only 30-minute episodes. Jerry Seinfeld stars as a version of himself who is navigating life as a comedian. At the same time, he hangs out with three of his best friends: former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), childhood buddy George Costanza (Jason Alexander) and neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards).\n\nYou can expect plenty of laughs while watching this show. It delivers famous lines like \"No soup for you!\" and \"Master of your domain.\" Of course, you'll have to watch and find out what they all mean before you quote them. Be prepared, though: If you become a dedicated fan and start quoting lines from \"Seinfeld,\" today's younger generation will likely have no idea what you're saying.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Loudermilk'\n\nLoudermilk Official Trailer | TV Comedy - YouTube Watch On\n\nRon Livingston stars as titular character Sam Loudermilk, a recovering alcoholic who doesn't have the greatest attitude about life. He happens to unleash his acid tongue on friends, loved ones and strangers. The series focuses on Sam's experience going through the 12-step program, the highs and lows of everybody in the group and their personal lives outside of their sessions. However, despite the potential for a negative overtone, \"Loudermilk\" manages to be pretty hilarious.\n\nSadly, we only got three seasons out of this show, although there have been rumors that Netflix will pick it up. Even so, you'll find a lot of enjoyment throughout the 30 episodes. Make sure to keep an eye out for the talented Will Sasso, whose presence is unforgettable in this show.\n\nSign up now to get the best Black Friday deals!

His mission? Finding a missing ruby necklace. Of course, the series goes beyond the case as it explores themes of loss, loneliness and the challenges of aging. Also, much like \"Grace and Frankie\" (see below), this show moves beyond stereotypes of the elderly, making it a must-watch for those tired of the typical shows about older people.\n\nWhat makes this show unique is that it doesn't go for the typical corny or goofball laughs. Despite the brevity of each episode, there's plenty of heart, but not so much that you feel like you've been scolded or have to worry about being brought down mood-wise.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'How I Met Your Mother'\n\nNavigating life post-college can seem a bit awkward, especially when you realize that you are now the adult you've been waiting to become one day. \"How I Met Your Mother\" is the perfect show to explore this weirdness as Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor with the older version narrated by Bob Saget) reflects on his life in New York City, telling his kids the story of how he met his wife aka their mother (hence the name).\n\nHe chronicles all the people he meets, including his ongoing crush and off-and-on-and-off relationship with Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders); his best friend and frequent womanizer, Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris); and loving couple Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel). Unlike \"Seinfeld,\" there are occasional life lessons found throughout. However, at its core, it's a funny early millennium show that will entertain you through its nine seasons.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Grace and Frankie'\n\nGrace and Frankie | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix - YouTube Watch On\n\nGrowing older and reaching your upper years can seem scary, especially with all that can happen at that age. But it doesn't have to be that way, as proven by \"Grace and Frankie.\" It stars real-life friends Jane Fonda as Grace Hanson and Lily Tomlin as Frankie Bergstein, who are figuring out life in their late 70s after learning their husbands are not only work partners but lovers.\n\nAfter just the first few episodes, you'll warm up to all the characters involved, including their husbands Robert Hanson (Martin Sheen) and Sol Bergstein (Sam Waterston). It's fun to see actors in their older years not playing into the stereotypes we're all so used to seeing in Hollywood. This show is a breath of fresh air and has all the fun, drama and warmth you hope to find. It's no surprise here that it was nominated for numerous Primetime Emmy awards.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Files of the Unexplained'\n\nFiles of the Unexplained | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf you want something more surreal, check out \"Files of the Unexplained.\" Each episode explores a bizarre phenomenon that happened to someone, such as UFOs, strange disappearances, weird encounters, and more.\n\nWhile it doesn't have the same spooky effect you would expect with classics such as \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" there is plenty to enjoy, especially if you're into paranormal encounter-level of entertainment. Each episode stands alone, so if one doesn't meet your expectations, just hit \"next.\" So far, Netflix hasn't announced the next season yet, but here's hoping they continue it as it's a unique premise that deserves exploring.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Sex and the City'\n\nSex and the City 25th Anniversary | Official Trailer | HBO - YouTube Watch On\n\nThis late '90s and early 2000s show was a groundbreaking show that completely changed how television portrayed women. Depicting women in their 30s and 40s who were open about their romantic relationships was not commonly seen on the small screen at the time. Sarah Jessica Parker plays the now-iconic Carrie Bradshaw, a sex columnist in love with shoes and a man she refers to as Mr. Big. Alongside Carrie are her closest friends: lawyer Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), art gallery curator Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) and public relations rep Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).\n\nNetflix has all six original seasons (although you'll have to venture off to Max for the newest iteration of the series, \"And Just Like That,\" as well as the movies). It's only a matter of time before you feel like you're part of the brunch crew.\n\nWatch on Netflix"

            "article_content": "Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of astronomy with the identification of seven new \"dark comets,\" celestial objects that resemble asteroids but exhibit comet-like behavior.\n\nThis announcement, made on December 9, 2024, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doubles the known population of dark comets, which now totals.\n\nThe concept of dark comets emerged from observations of asteroid 2003 RM in 2016, which displayed unexpected orbital deviations that could not be explained by typical asteroid dynamics.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDavide Farnocchia, a coauthor of the study at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, noted that such perturbations usually indicate outgassing, a characteristic of comets. However, 2003 RM lacked any visible cometary features, leading to its classification as a dark comet.\n\nThe recent findings reveal that dark comets fall into two distinct categories: outer dark comets, which are larger and share characteristics with Jupiter-family comets, and inner dark comets, which are smaller and reside in the inner solar system.\n\nDarryl Seligman, lead author of the new paper and a postdoctoral fellow at Michigan State University, explained that analysing these objects' reflectivity and orbits has provided insights into their differing properties.\n\nDark comets are believed to originate from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n\nTheir unique behaviour raises intriguing questions about their composition and potential role in delivering water and organic materials to Earth. Seligman emphasised that understanding these objects could shed light on the origins of life on our planet.\n\nWhile dark comets do not exhibit traditional cometary features like tails or comae, their non-gravitational accelerations suggest they may contain sublimating ice. This characteristic positions them as potential sources for water delivery to early Earth, supporting theories about how life-sustaining materials reached our planet.\n\nThe discovery of these celestial bodies not only expands our understanding of the solar system's complex dynamics but also opens up new avenues for research. Scientists are eager to explore their origins further and investigate whether they could harbor ice or other essential compounds.\n\nAs researchers continue to study dark comets, they hope to unravel more mysteries about their nature and significance in the context of planetary formation and the development of life on Earth.\n\n"

            "article_content": "In September 2004, NASA\u2019s Genesis return sample capsule tumbled from the sky and slammed into the Utah desert in a remote part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground, shattering the delicate solar wind collectors it carried. The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She is an assistant research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Meteorite Studies in Tempe, Arizona, and a chief Genesis team member working on the cleaning problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to figure out how to use these itty-bitty little samples that had gotten dirty. Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned. But look at what we can still do with the samples.\u201d NASA\u2019s Genesis spacecraft crashed into the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in 2004. Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

            "article_content": "OpenAI said Monday it\u2019s releasing its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, later in the day.\n\nThe AI video-generation model works similarly to OpenAI\u2019s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E: A user types out a desired scene, and Sora will return a high-definition video clip. Sora can also generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. The Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup, which burst into the mainstream last year thanks to the viral popularity of ChatGPT, introduced Sora in February.\n\nIt\u2019ll debut to U.S. users as well as to \u201cmost countries internationally\u201d later today, according to OpenAI\u2019s YouTube livestream, and the company has \u201cno timeline\u201d yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries.\n\nOpenAI said users don\u2019t need to pay extra for the tool, which will be included in existing ChatGPT accounts such as Plus and Pro. Employees on the livestream and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman demonstrated features like \u201cBlend\u201d (i.e., joining two scenes together at the user\u2019s direction), as well as the option to make an AI-generated video endlessly repeat.\n\nUntil now, Sora has mainly been available to a small group of safety testers, or \u201cred-teamers,\u201d who test the model for vulnerabilities in areas such as misinformation and bias.\n\nReddit users asked OpenAI executives in October about Sora\u2019s release date, questioning whether it was being delayed \u201cdue to the amount of compute/time required for inference or due to safety.\u201d In response, OpenAI\u2019s product chief Kevin Weil wrote, \u201cNeed to perfect the model, need to get safety/impersonation/other things right, and need to scale compute!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI,\u201d Rohan Sahai, OpenAI\u2019s Sora product lead, said on the livestream, adding that the company needs to prevent illegal use of the technology. \u201cBut we also want to balance that with creative expression.\u201d\n\nOpenAI closed its latest funding round in October at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and Big Tech companies. It also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a serious growth plan for OpenAI, as the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup battles Amazon-backed Anthropic, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon for the biggest slice of the generative AI market, which is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nEarlier this month, OpenAI hired its first chief marketing officer, indicating plans to spend more on marketing to grow its user base. And in October, OpenAI debuted a search feature within ChatGPT that positions it to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Perplexity and may attract more users who otherwise visited those sites to search the web.\n\nWith Sora, the ChatGPT maker is looking to compete with video-generation AI tools from companies such as Meta and Google, which announced Lumiere in January. Similar AI tools are available from other startups, such as Stability AI\u2019s Stable Video Diffusion. Amazon has also released Create with Alexa, a model that specializes in generating prompt-based short-form animated children\u2019s content.\n\nVideo could be the next frontier for generative AI now that chatbots and image generators have made their way into the consumer and business world. While the creative opportunities will excite some AI enthusiasts, the new technologies present serious misinformation concerns as major political elections occur across the globe. The number of AI-generated deepfakes created has increased 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm.\n\nOpenAI has made multimodality \u2014 the combining of text, image and video generation \u2014 a prominent goal in its effort to offer a broader suite of AI models.\n\nNews of Sora\u2019s release follows protestors\u2019 decision to leak what appeared to be a copy of Sora over concerns about the ChatGPT maker\u2019s treatment of artists.\n\nSome members of OpenAI\u2019s early access program for Sora, which it said included about 300 artists, published an open letter in late November critiquing OpenAI for not being sufficiently open or supporting the arts beyond marketing.\n\n\u201cDear corporate AI overlords,\u201d the protestors\u2019 open letter stated, \u201cWe received access to Sora with the promise to be early testers, red teamers and creative partners. However, we believe instead we are being lured into \u2018art washing\u2019 to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that hundreds of artists provided unpaid labor for OpenAI through bug testing and feedback on Sora, and that \u201cwhile hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened \u2014 offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not against the use of AI technology as a tool for the arts (if we were, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been invited to this program),\u201d the open letter stated. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release. We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.\u201d\n\nIn late November, an OpenAI spokesperson responded to the protestors\u2019 actions in a statement to CNBC.\n\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards,\u201d the OpenAI spokesperson said at the time. \u201cParticipation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool. We\u2019ve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs.\u201d"

            "article_content": "OpenAI launched its video-generating tool, Sora, on Monday. But the company\u2019s opting not to release a key feature for most users pending further testing.\n\nThe feature in question generates a video using an uploaded photo or footage of a real person as a reference. OpenAI says that it\u2019ll give a \u201csubset\u201d of Sora users access to it, but that it won\u2019t roll out the capability broadly until it has a chance to fine-tune its \u201capproach to safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to generate a video using an uploaded photo or video of a real person as the \u2018seed\u2019 is a vector of potential misuse that we are taking a particularly incremental approach toward to learn from early patterns of use,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cEarly feedback from artists indicate that this is a powerful creative tool they value, but given the potential for abuse, we are not initially making it available to all users.\u201d\n\nOpenAI also won\u2019t let users share generated videos containing clips or images of real people to Sora\u2019s homepage discovery feed.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI, so we want to prevent illegal activity with Sora, but we also want to balance that with creative expression,\u201d Rohan Sahai, Sora\u2019s product lead, said during a livestream presentation earlier today. \u201cWe know that [this will be] an ongoing challenge \u2014 we might not get it perfect on day one. We\u2019re starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn\u2019t quite get it right, just give us that feedback.\u201d\n\nGenerative video is a powerful tool \u2014 and a controversial one, with deepfakes and misinformation being significant concerns. According to data from ID verification service Sumsub, deepfake fraud worldwide increased by more than 10 times from 2022 to 2023.\n\nAmong other steps OpenAI says it\u2019s taking to prevent misuse, Sora has a filter to detect whether a generated video depicts someone under the age of 18. If it does, OpenAI applies a \u201cstricter threshold\u201d for moderation related to sexual, violent, or self-harm content, the company claims.\n\nAll Sora-generated videos contain metadata to show their provenance \u2014 specifically metadata that abides by the C2PA technical standard. The metadata can be removed, granted. But OpenAI\u2019s pitching it as a way for platforms that support C2PA to quickly detect whether a video originated from Sora.\n\nIn a bid to fend off copyright complaints, OpenAI also says that it\u2019s using \u201cprompt re-writing\u201d to prevent Sora from generating videos in the style of a living creator.\n\n\u201cWe have added prompt re-writes that are designed to trigger when a user attempts to generate a video in the style of a living artist,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe opted to take a conservative approach with this version of Sora as we learn more about how Sora is used by the creative community \u2026 There is a very long tradition in creativity of building off of other artists\u2019 styles, but we appreciate that some creators may have concerns.\u201d\n\nA number of artists have sued AI companies, including OpenAI, over allegedly training on their works without permission to create AI tools that regurgitate content in their unique styles. The companies, for their parts, have claimed that fair use doctrine protects them from copyright infringement claims, and that AI models don\u2019t, in fact, regurgitate.\n\nOn training, OpenAI will only say that Sora was developed using a mix of \u201cdiverse datasets,\u201d including publicly available data, proprietary data accessed through its partnerships with data vendors, and custom sets developed in-house. Early this year, ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati didn\u2019t outright deny that Sora was trained on YouTube clips, in seeming violation of the Google-owned streaming platform\u2019s usage policy.\n\nAccording to video blogger Marques Brownlee, who got an early preview of Sora, the system can create multiple variations of video clips from a text prompt or image and edit existing videos via a Re-mix tool. A Storyboard interface lets users create sequences of videos; a Blend tool takes two videos and creates a new one that preserves elements of both; and Loop and Re-cut options allow creators to further tweak and edit their videos and scenes.\n\nSubscribers to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro and Plus plans get access to Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, today \u2014 but only if they live in certain countries.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro and Plus plans will get access to Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, starting today \u2014 but only if they live in certain countries.\n\nDuring a livestream Monday afternoon, OpenAI revealed key information about Sora, including technical details. The version launching today, called Sora Turbo, can generate clips between 5 seconds and 20 seconds in length in a range of different aspect ratios and resolutions.\n\n\u201cThis early version of Sora will make mistakes \u2014 it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s already at the point where we think it\u2019s going to be really useful for augmenting human creativity,\u201d said Will Peebles, a member of OpenAI\u2019s technical staff and a research lead on Sora, during the livestream. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see what the world is going to make with Sora.\u201d\n\nAccording to video blogger Marques Brownlee, who got an early preview of Sora, the system can create multiple variations of video clips from a text prompt or image and edit existing videos via a Re-mix tool. A Storyboard interface lets users create sequences of videos; a Blend tool takes two videos and creates a new one that preserves elements of both; and Loop and Re-cut options allow creators to further tweak and edit their videos and scenes.\n\nSora was having major capacity issues as of early Monday evening, however.\n\nCredits are required to generate videos with Sora, with the amount varying depending on the resolution and duration. ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans provide between 1,000 and 10,000 credits, which reset monthly at midnight sans rollovers.\n\n480p videos generated with Sora cost 20 to 150 credits, 720p videos cost 30 to 540 credits, and 1080p videos cost 100 to 2,000 credits. Pricing gets a bit convoluted beyond that.\n\nChatGPT Plus plans include 1,000 credits for up to 50 \u201cpriority videos\u201d (that is, videos that generate quickly) at 720p and 5 seconds, while Pro plans include 10,000 credits for up to 500 priority videos at 1080p and 20 seconds. Pro also includes unlimited \u201crelaxed\u201d \u2014 i.e., low-priority \u2014 videos without watermarks. By default, Sora videos are watermarked with a visual indicator in the lower-right-hand corner.\n\nSomething to note: By default, OpenAI trains on new Sora videos. Disabling this requires clicking on the profile icon on the top-right of the Sora homepage, selecting Settings > Data controls, and toggling off \u201cImprove the model for everyone.\u201d\n\nAnd Sora isn\u2019t available in the EU, at least to start. A newly published help page on OpenAI\u2019s website listing the supported territories for Sora \u201con web and mobile\u201d omits EU countries and the UK. On the page, OpenAI notes that accessing Sora outside the regions listed may result in an account ban or suspension.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try our hardest to be able to launch [in Europe], but we don\u2019t have any timing to share yet,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during the livestream. \u201cAnd there are some other countries that we\u2019re not able to operate in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time OpenAI has skipped over EU countries for an initial product launch. This summer, when the company began rolling out Advanced Voice Mode, its human-like conversational feature for ChatGPT, EU users were left out of the early waves.\n\nIn a statement provided to TechRadar this fall, OpenAI attributed the Advanced Voice Mode delay to the \u201cadditional external reviews\u201d required by some territories. \u201cThis is a common practice to ensure [our] feature aligns with local requirements,\u201d a spokesperson told the publication at the time. \u201cThese [reviews] can take a little time.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode arrived for most EU customers in October.\n\nOther tech companies working on AI models and products, including Meta and Microsoft, have also been forced to push back AI product releases in the EU due to the bloc\u2019s complex web of data privacy regulations. Meta has been particularly vocal about compliance requirements it sees as onerous, earlier this year endorsing an open letter calling for \u201ca modern interpretation\u201d of European privacy laws that doesn\u2019t \u201creject [AI] progress.\u201d\n\nSora\u2019s debut comes after a group leaked access to the video generator in protest of what they called duplicity and \u201cart washing\u201d on OpenAI\u2019s part. The group claimed that OpenAI pressured Sora\u2019s early testers, including red teamers and creative partners, to spin a positive narrative around Sora and failed to fairly compensate them for their work.\n\n"

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nCybercriminals are also employing real-world physical attacks in addition to digital threats, US cybersecurity firm Fortinet finds\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 US cybersecurity firm Fortinet on Tuesday, December 10, presented to the media their annual threat predictions report for 2025.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence continues to generate buzz. In the cybersecurity industry, Fortinet describes an ongoing arms race between cybersecurity professionals and firms such as them, and threat actors.\n\nThreat actors have made use of artificial intelligence in the past year in order to make attacks more efficient, more prevalent, and more targeted. Through AI, threat actors or hackers can more easily, for example, craft more sophisticated phishing messages that may have a higher chance of reeling in a victim.\n\nAI has also been deployed by these hackers to much more easily modify code in order to evade security updates.\n\nThe technology has also lowered the barrier for entry for would-be hackers, much in the same way that people can now code programs with the help of large language models (LLMs). These are some of the threats being presented by AI, and Fortinet expects that such usage will only expand in the coming year.\n\nFor their part and the part of other cybersecurity vendors, they leverage AI for detecting danger patterns across whole swaths of network that manual monitoring just wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish. Fortifying their software solutions is also helped along with AI tools.\n\nIt has always been an arms race between attackers and cybersecurity vendors. The difference here is that AI scales up the speed, efficiency, and frequency of attacks, necessitating vendors to make use of similar technologies to maintain defenses.\n\nAside from AI, here are the key trends to expect:\n\nMore attack chain expertise emerges. In recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d Cloud-specific attacks to rise. While endpoint or edge devices like smartphones and computers continue to draw attention from attackers, the cloud is \u201cpiquing the interest\u201d of cyberattackers more so than in past years. \u201cGiven that most organizations rely on multiple cloud providers, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re observing more cloud-specific vulnerabilities being leveraged by attackers, anticipating that this trend will grow in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile endpoint or edge devices like smartphones and computers continue to draw attention from attackers, the cloud is \u201cpiquing the interest\u201d of cyberattackers more so than in past years. \u201cGiven that most organizations rely on multiple cloud providers, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re observing more cloud-specific vulnerabilities being leveraged by attackers, anticipating that this trend will grow in the future.\u201d Automated hacking tools make their way to dark web marketplace. \u201cWe anticipate that attackers will use the automated output from LLMs to power CaaS offerings and grow the market, such as taking social media reconnaissance and automating that intelligence into neatly packaged phishing kits,\u201d Fortinet said.

Threat groups are \u201cbecoming more aggressive and destructive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing some cybercrime groups physically threaten an organization\u2019s executives and employees in some instances and anticipate that this will become a regular part of many playbooks. We also anticipate that transnational crime \u2014 such as drug trafficking, smuggling people or goods, and more \u2014 will become a regular component of more sophisticated playbooks, with cybercrime groups and transnational crime organizations working together,\u201d Fortinet said.\n\nOn the positive end of things, the firm also expects that anti-adversary frameworks will expand, urging the cybersecurity community to pursue global collaborations, and private-public partnerships to keep up with evolving strategies of cybercriminals.\n\nRashish Pandey, VP, marketing and communications, said, \u201cAs cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, 2025 is poised to bring a new wave of highly specialized and AI-driven attacks\u2026Our predictions underscore the need for organizations to anticipate and adapt to an increasingly dynamic threat landscape.\u201d \u2013 Rappler.com"

Styling as well as drying your hair, the device is the ideal way to get salon-perfect hair from home. Right now, there\u2019s 15% off the Shark FlexFusion range when you buy direct from Sharkclean.com. All you have to do is use the code FUSION15 any time between now and December 31. That means you could get a Shark FlexFusion from just $280 depending on the model you choose. Sounds good, right? Let\u2019s take a look at the range.\n\nWhy you should buy a Shark FlexFusion\n\nParticularly for anyone with thick hair, buying one of the best hair dryers is a huge game changer. However, it\u2019s an even bigger deal if you combine drying with styling components. Many people love the Dyson Corrale for this role but it isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s much more expensive than the Shark FlexFusion. Going with Shark means you can budget for an extra gift or simply enjoy a considerable saving.\n\nOne of the best options is the with Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush. Down to $280 from $330 when you apply the code FUSION15, you get the perfect all-in-one tool for drying, curling, volumizing, smoothing, or straightening. There\u2019s no risk of heat damage from styling and you can even dry and style wet hair. It also has a scalp shield for protecting your scalp, and it\u2019s developed by dermatologists so you\u2019re all good here.\n\nWhen buying, you can choose two accessories such as a FrizzFighter, Oval Burhs, or auto-wrapper. It\u2019s perfect for personalizing your gift choice for your loved one. If you want to spend more, you can do so by investing in more accessories, or by adding on an air straightener. It\u2019s great to have such flexibility here as it feels much more like picking an individual gift for someone rather than just choosing an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Shark FlexFusion range is now available with 15% off when you use the code FUSION15 at Sharkclean.com. The code works until December 31 but we think it\u2019d be great to buy now to gift to someone ahead of the holidays. Check out which bundle works best for you by tapping the link below and don\u2019t forget to apply the code!"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

            "article_content": "From October 7 to 10, the winners of the 2024 Nobel Prize were announced in a staggered manner. The awards ceremony will take place on Tuesday, December 10, to commemorate the anniversary of the death of its founder, the Swedish businessman and researcher Alfred Nobel, which occurred in 1896. Also from December 7 to 10, a series of events will be held to present the winners and talk about their research and contribution to humanity\n\nThe awards will be presented in Stockholm, Sweden, by King Carl Gustaf of Sweden, for the prizes in physics, chemistry, economics, literature and medicine, while the peace prize is presented hours earlier in Oslo, Norway.\n\nDuring the week, the different winners participate in the Nobel Week, which consists of different public events where they present their research and their careers are recognised. On the day of the ceremony, they will give an acceptance speech for their awards and receive the iconic gold medal with the bust of Alfred Nobel, as well as a cash prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to $1.1 million\n\nThe history of the Nobel Prizes\n\nAt the time of his death, Alfred Nobel stipulated in his will that his fortune should be used to reward those who \"have conferred the greatest benefit to humanity,\" in the fields in which Nobel himself worked: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, economics and peace.\n\nAfter a long process of organizing and evaluating the candidates, the first prizes in his honor were awarded in 1901 and have become a worldwide milestone\n\nWhere to watch the 2024 Nobel Prize ceremony?\n\nThe Nobel Prize awards ceremony will be broadcast through the official channels of the prize itself: nobelprize.org and its official social networks: Facebook, X, YouTube and LinkedIn.\n\nThe award ceremony will take place on Tuesday, December 10 at 16:00 Central European Time (CET), which is 10:00 ET/07:00 PT\n\nWho are the Nobel Prize winners in 2024?\n\nPhysics: John Hopfield and Geoffry Hinton\n\nHopfield, from Princeton University, and Hinton, from the University of Toronto, received the prize \"for fundamental discoveries and inventions that allow machine learning through artificial neural networks,\" according to the Nobel Committee.\n\nBoth used tools from physics to lay the foundations of AI by designing methods that allow machines to learn through artificial neural networks. This allows machines to mimic human functions such as memory and learning.\n\nChemistry: David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper\n\nBaker, a researcher at the University of Washington, received the award for his work: \"Computational design of proteins\"\n\nWhile Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, both researchers at Google DeepMind, received the award for their work on predicting protein structure using AI, using a system called AlphaFold2, which is capable of predicting the structure of almost 200 million proteins, virtually all known proteins. As a result, it is now much easier to understand antibiotic resistance.\n\nLiterature: Han Kang\n\nThe Korean writer has been recognised as the only woman to receive the Nobel this year for \"her intense poetic prose, which addresses historical traumas and reveals the fragility of human life\".\n\nHer best-known work worldwide is The Vegetarian (2007), a sample of a rich and complex writing, ranging from poetry to novels, which is why she is considered one of the most influential literary figures of her generation.\n\nMedicine: Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun\n\nAmbros, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts, and Harvard's Ruvkun are recognized for the discovery of \"microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional regulation of genes\". Their discovery indicates that these molecules constitute an essential mechanism for controlling genes and their role is fundamental for the differentiation of cells and their alteration, which can lead to cancer.\n\nEconomics: Simon Johnson, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson\n\nJohnson and Acemoglu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Robinson from the University of Chicago present a study on the formation of economic and political institutions and their positive influence in shaping the prosperity of nations and reducing inequality between them.\n\nTheir work analyses the political and economic systems used by European empires in their colonies from the 16th century onwards and how they worked for the welfare of their populations. With this analysis, they explain why differences in prosperity persist and how institutions can change.\n\nPeace: Survivors of the atomic bombs\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize recognizes the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo, made up of survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and recognizes their fight against nuclear weapons, in order to eradicate them worldwide, thanks to their testimonies of the tragedy that occurred in 1945."

            "article_content": "In September 2004, NASA\u2019s Genesis return sample capsule tumbled from the sky and slammed into the Utah desert in a remote part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground, shattering the delicate solar wind collectors it carried. The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She is an assistant research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Meteorite Studies in Tempe, Arizona, and a chief Genesis team member working on the cleaning problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to figure out how to use these itty-bitty little samples that had gotten dirty. Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned. But look at what we can still do with the samples.\u201d NASA\u2019s Genesis spacecraft crashed into the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in 2004. Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

            "article_content": "User experience\n\nIn the highly crowded application market, user experience is a competitive differentiator. Enterprise apps need pixel-perfect UIs that are true to the vision of the designer. To achieve this, UX and development teams must collaborate closely. They can\u2019t just take a hands-off approach but must fundamentally understand the intent and vision of the designer at every step of the way. This is unlikely to happen within the citizen development paradigm. Business users will be short of skills to convert the vision and intricacies of design, such as dynamic content, micro-animations, branding elements, etc., from a simple drag-and-drop interface.\n\nApplication architecture\n\nComplex enterprise apps must have full-stack development capabilities, from API design and high-performance back-end infrastructure all the way to Docker integration. Business users rely entirely on the low-code platform to abstract all of this. Some platforms do, but most don\u2019t. Either way, the bigger problem is in long-term problem-solving. When something goes wrong\u2014and in tech, it invariably will\u2014citizen developers can\u2019t effectively troubleshoot. And the long-term maintenance cost of apps built by business users becomes exponentially high.\n\nCustomizability\n\nProponents of citizen development argue that the apps built with low-code platforms are highly customizable. What they mean is that they have the ability to mix and match elements and change colors. For enterprise apps, this is all in a day\u2019s work. True customizability comes from real editable code that empowers developers to hand-code parts to handle complex and edge cases. Business users cannot build these types of features because low-code platforms themselves are not designed to handle this."

Police also told the NYT that Mangione is now considered a \"strong person of interest\" in light of the new evidence.\n\nMangione, a prep school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate, was captured by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania earlier on Monday. His arrest followed a days-long manhunt for Thompson's suspected assassin that included the deployment of drones, scuba divers, and K-9 units.\n\nAs digital sleuths discovered soon after Mangione's name was released, the young man's social media accounts contain a wealth of information about his worldview, which seems to have morphed from disgruntled academic to angry manarchist over the course of this year \u2014 before dropping off completely months before the killing.\n\nThis entire debacle has been incredibly dramatic \u2014 and as we learn more about law enforcement's primary suspect, we're likely in for a few more shocks.\n\nMore on the murder of Brian Thompson: Bill Burr: Murdered Insurance CEO Was a \"Gangster\""

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways Probabilistic Thinking: Though it does not come naturally, seeing the world through the lens of probability helps us achieve positive outcomes in an uncertain world.\n\nMindset Shift: Embracing probabilistic approaches allows teams to manage uncertainty and control risk, rather than relying on flawed cause-and-effect assumptions.\n\nSystem Design: Developing adaptive systems that can adjust how we work to changing conditions is more effective than creating exhaustive upfront plans.\n\nBeyond Planning: By appreciating systems, thinking in bets, and focussing on outcomes, we can move past the need for detailed plans.\n\nControlling Volatility: Leaders can use various methods to make safe bets in a controlled environment, while responding and reacting to new developments as they emerge\n\nSoftware delivery at a very large scale is extremely complex. We are not just pulling stories from a backlog in a scrum of scrums; we coordinate the collective effort of hundreds or even thousands of engineers across dozens of teams and multiple organizations to deliver a single, integrated system. These are globally distributed products and services built by the world\u2019s largest companies and provided to the most demanding customers. With so many moving parts, each requirement, team, integration, and interaction point becomes a nexus of possible failure modes. The question looms in such a complex environment: How can we turn the odds in our favor when faced with complexity so vast that failures are inevitable? Surprisingly, the answer may lie in the strategies employed in an unlikely place - Las Vegas.\n\nGames of Chance\n\nIn 1960, MIT mathematician Edward Thorp visited Las Vegas with a skeptic\u2019s eye. He noticed other players were deluded by the potential for finding betting patterns that could give them an edge on the felt. In his autobiography A Man for All Markets, he wrote, \"Mathematicians had proved no system of varying bets could blunt the casino\u2019s edge. Generations of gamblers had been seeking the impossible. Players are confused about the inevitability of losing in the long term\". This failure to grasp the mathematical futility of their pursuit reveals a fundamental human bias.\n\nThe logic of probability defies our natural intuition. We live in a world of apparent cause-and-effect relationships - touch the stove, you get burned. This daily experience of determinism and certainty shapes our thinking, creating a cognitive trap when encountering complex, probabilistic systems. We instinctively search for deterministic patterns where none exist, making incorrect associations that obscure the true statistical relationships beneath the surface.\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\nYet our hero Thorp was no foolish gambler. His mathematical training told him there might be a way to bend the rules - not by finding misguided patterns, but by understanding the deep structure of the underlying probability of the game. While others failed with betting systems, Thorp saw something hidden underneath Blackjack: a dynamic system where the probability landscape shifted with each card played. Armed with a crucial advantage - a computer - he began a multi-year mission to map the odds of the game. Using an IBM 704, he methodically calculated the odds for millions of card combinations, analyzing how removing each card altered the probability space.\n\nThe result was revolutionary: a system for navigating the probability curve. Thorp could track how the odds shifted between dealer and player by keeping a running count of played cards. When low cards were depleted, leaving a deck rich in high cards, the odds turned in the player\u2019s favor - signaling when to increase bets. His 1962 book Beat The Dealer revealed this system to the world, spawning the famous MIT Blackjack Team and embedding card counting in popular culture. More importantly, it demonstrated how systematic thinking about probability could transform uncertainty from an obstacle into an opportunity.\n\nPlanning in Software\n\nFast forward to today, and our world is defined by computers. In very large software delivery projects, we\u2019re tackling incredibly complex problems using vast teams, aiming to deliver high-value outcomes on a global scale. The intuition here is precisely what you would expect from us, mere humans, the same humans that misunderstand probability - we apply a system of management based on causality. With this, we fall into the trap of classical logic: the idea that we can precisely lay out a path and then follow it correctly over many months and even years. Somehow, this seems to make sense. Fictional, though it may be, the story we tell feels real.\n\nTo that end, we have tried to apply the same management systems designed for delivering real-world outcomes - factories, bridges, skyscrapers - to software. These approaches suit the physical world and its classical mechanics, trying to create predictability through determinism. They operate from the premise that work can be exhaustively described, so the focus is on centralized planning, tracking, and reporting.\n\nBut plans like these need to be correct to be successful - they make big bets on a series of events that need to succeed. And when they don\u2019t? The belief that we can press the system into submission is also supported by the conventional wisdom of determinism, which argues that we can throw people, money, and more planning at the problem to eventually emerge with something that works. Unfortunately, the premise is flawed, and the plan will continue to execute exactly as it should: into failure. Since this kind of significant up-front correctness is not something we can count on in software, we have seen these approaches consistently fail.\n\nIn software, we don\u2019t get predictability through causality. Large batches, risk-aversion, phased process, over-planning, big bang deliveries - these are the mistakes we make when we try to wrestle certainty from the hand of randomness. Rather than be like the misguided gambler, we must resist the pull of deterministic thinking.\n\nBeat the Odds\n\nJust as Thorp used probabilistic thinking and system design to beat the odds in blackjack, software development teams can improve delivery outcomes by adopting probabilistic approaches and designing adaptive systems that manage uncertainty and control volatility. With this mindset, we can move beyond traditional planning methods and develop systems that guide us through complexity and uncertainty, much like Thorp did at the blackjack table.\n\nThorpe\u2019s Blackjack system is a fantastic example of thinking in probabilities to create a system that achieves consistent outcomes in a non-deterministic way. Using a card counting system won\u2019t win you every hand, but you will consistently walk away a winner over many hours. We cannot predict what will happen throughout the play; no chart shows when the winning starts and the losing stops. Instead, the player focuses on the system, using it to read the table, adapting the play to the changing odds, and creating the circumstances for long-term success within persistent uncertainty. As long as the player is using the system correctly and doesn\u2019t get distracted by everything happening around them, they will achieve success.\n\nWhat Thorpe managed to do is control volatility over time. In probability theory, volatility is the amount of variance we see in a system over time. The more volatile a system is, the more extensive the range of outcomes we expect. By reducing bets when the odds are bad and increasing them when the odds are good, card counting uses a boundary condition on the probability curve to detect when volatility increases and when it reduces. In other words, we restrict our actions when we are in the danger zone and open them up when the surface area of positive outcomes increases. This idea that volatility is a fixed system element and that we are merely subject to its whims is perhaps a common intellectual fallacy. With card counting, Thorp found a way to play with the risk curve and capitalize on its changes over time. And so can we.\n\nBeat the Plan\n\nIn enterprise software delivery, we, too, are trying to win a long series of bets. We play from a deck of visions, missions, roadmaps, priorities, and many small decisions as we try to harness the potential of an uncertain world. Thorp faced the volatility of card distributions and used a statistical system to gain an edge. Likewise, in software, we face volatility in project requirements, implementation details, customer expectations, and market directions, but just as Thorpe used his card counting system, we can use our systems to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nWe create systems to guide us through a series of events over a long period, allowing us to exceed the limitations in our ability to plan work. To do better than a plan - to beat the plan - we need systems. Where plans might fail us, systems can save us. How might we use thinking in probabilities to design better systems? I see three key areas:\n\nWe need to have an appreciation for systems, a phrase I am borrowing from W. Edwards Deming\u2019s System of Profound Knowledge. Effective systems will protect us from the probability of failures. It is our systems that give us the edge. Systems like quality frameworks, continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems guide our decision-making. They are designed to enable us to make decisions safely while providing feedback to help us understand our risk and adjust accordingly. We want to elevate our perspective by looking at the network of components that work together, considering the relationships and interactions between different parts of a system and other systems and external factors. This is where probabilistic thinking becomes effective.\n\nThe next idea is to embrace a concept explored by former World Series poker player Annie Duke in her book Thinking in Bets. She defines a bet as a \"decision about an uncertain future\", and what\u2019s crucial to understand is that correct decisions don\u2019t guarantee a result. Every poker player knows the \"bad beat\", where a well-played hand loses due to sheer luck. To that end, Annie notes that the world\u2019s greatest poker players spend an unusual amount of time analyzing their decision-making process to understand whether they correctly applied their system, regardless of whether they win or lose. This wisdom is incredibly poignant to us in software, where we first need to view our decisions as bets and, second, place more value on reflecting on how we place them. We leave many parts of our work as tacit knowledge and only do retrospectives at a system level when things go wrong. We can build more resilient organizations by surfacing implicit systems and regularly examining how well we follow them rather than just reacting to successes and failures.\n\nOver time, what matters isn\u2019t individual decisions but our ability to achieve successful outcomes through consistent system-following behavior. Just as the card sharp doesn\u2019t need to win every hand to walk away ahead, a well-designed software delivery system should absorb the impact of failed experiments and wrong turns while keeping us moving toward our goals. Individual decisions - whether to refactor a service, which technology to adopt, how to structure a team, or which feature to build - may be right or wrong, but the wisdom of probability tells us the cumulative outcome matters. This is why the above two points are crucial: they help us understand whether we succeeded or failed and whether our systems are effectively guiding us toward desired outcomes despite inevitable setbacks. By setting our targets on outcomes rather than individual decisions, we create space for controlled experimentation and learning, allowing our systems to evolve and improve even as they keep us on track.\n\nThese three principles - systems thinking, betting mindset, and outcomes focus - reframe how we should approach planning in software delivery. Rather than creating perfect plans, we need to build systems that can guide us through uncertainty. A plan may tell us where we want to go, but our systems determine whether we\u2019ll get there. This brings us to the crucial question: How do we design systems that can navigate the complexities of large-scale software delivery while managing the inevitable volatility we\u2019ll encounter along the way?\n\nPlan the System\n\nWe can transform software delivery uncertainty into predictable outcomes just as Thorp transformed gambling uncertainty into a calculable advantage. But where Thorp dealt with the relatively constrained world of card probabilities, we face a far more complex challenge. Our deck contains countless variables with hidden interactions and long histories that come together and fall apart in different ways. Team dynamics, technical dependencies, market changes, customer needs, and organizational issues all interact and influence each other in ways that frustrate traditional planning methods. How might we leverage systems of software delivery to control this volatility?\n\nThe key lies in establishing boundaries that control volatility while maintaining the flexibility to adapt. Through years of experience and evolution, I\u2019ve identified five critical elements that work together to create such systems:\n\nAgility - decoupling predictability from causality\n\nContinuous Methods - using continuous methods to solve discrete problems\n\nPrioritization - working on areas with the highest volatility first\n\nConstraints - imposing enabling restrictions and limitations\n\nCulture - promoting healthy values and behaviors\n\nAll of these come together to help us design and execute systems that manage our bets and drive us toward targeted outcomes. Let\u2019s dig into each area.\n\n1. Agility - The first thing we need to do is decouple predictability from causality. We can achieve predictable outcomes without knowing all the details, creating paths that do not create much risk. Where Thorp managed the volatility of his game by adjusting bets according to his card counting system, in software development, we can manage project volatility by working in short cycles and adjusting in light of what our systems of work are telling us. We use these systems to take our \"count\", take it more often, assess our situation, and make small bets that succeed or fail without creating excessive risk. For example, we can reallocate resources to high-priority or high-risk areas as the project evolves or adjust requirements based on our learning. Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies form a system that gives us a regular \"read\" of the table, one we use to recalibrate where needed to land inside the range of desired outcomes eventually, which is why they are so effective for us. With this in mind, you don\u2019t need to cargo cult (imitation without understanding) practices into your organization - you can evaluate them in this light.\n\n2. Continuous Methods - The third element is continuous practices. We reduce the risk of our short-term decisions by situating them in systems of overarching engineering practices. This is the domain of Lean, where we convert discrete events into continuous practices so that each bet is placed under the same conditions. TDD, CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, Automated Governance, etc. Just as Thorpe updated his card count with every hand, we run our own operations with every iteration, perhaps with every code commit, ensuring that playing a hand does not change our risk assessment equation. If we allow failing tests, security issues, defects, and the like to build up, we will no longer play our hands under the same conditions. With creative thinking, we can find ways to convert all discrete elements of software delivery into continuous functions in our engineering systems.\n\n3. Prioritization - Next, how can we get an \"unfair\" advantage in our work? By stacking the deck! This is one area where we diverge from the gambler - we get to cheat. We can choose how we structure, scope, and sequence our work to create the least amount of risk for ourselves, prioritizing the work according to where the most volatility lies. For example, integrations always present a high degree of risk, but if we focus on them first, we can continuously integrate subsystem changes throughout the delivery process. This means we get to play the game knowing that the bad cards have already been dealt! Further, prioritization should be implemented as a continuous system, not as a big upfront plan. As we progress through our work, we gain insight into whether the rest of the deck is stacked for or against us and continuously re-evaluate our position. To achieve this, we need to involve the experts closest to the problem in the feedback loops of our work delivery systems. Having a generic, common-sense understanding of how the world works is not enough. We need the representation of technical experts with deep knowledge to guide difficult decisions and develop creative solutions that achieve an optimal balance of risk and reward.\n\n4. Constraints - The fourth element is the role of constraints, as in when and how to apply constraints to achieve better outcomes from the system. This differs from classical/deterministic systems, where the constraints are imposed upon the system from outside (the cost of materials, the laws of physics, etc.), and the system operates against them. In synthetic/non-deterministic systems, constraints are imposed; they are system elements we can experiment with, adding and removing as we evolve to get the right mixture of velocity and quality. We deliberately introduce helpful governing and enabling constraints into the system to contend with volatility. In Blackjack, Thorpe had only a few quantitatively defined boundary conditions to guide his system, but in software organizations, we have a wide variety of these boundaries with which to play. For example, we can introduce technical constraints, scheduling constraints, organizational constraints, resourcing constraints, and more. We can use these to create forces that will shape the direction of our work, implementing them in a wide variety of ways with various degrees of strictness.\n\n5. Culture - Finally, we have the values and behaviors that form our culture. Thorpe\u2019s card-counting system requires commitment, focus, and discipline to succeed. In the same way, we need cultural norms that will shape and guide participants\u2019 behavior in our systems. To compensate for the uncertainty and knowledge gaps from building complex distributed systems, we must promote values like learning, transparency, citizenship, and shared responsibility. And for us, like Thorpe, we need the discipline and commitment to follow the systems we put in place. A key goal is to motivate people to make decisions that are best for the overall system, not for themselves, because it is, in fact, the system that brings people success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe logic of probability is not readily forthcoming - our intuition does not give up on what we know well: a world of cause-and-effect relationships, reproducible and mechanical, in which one thing always leads to another. Touch the stove, and you get burned. The conditioning of classical logic in our daily lives creates a trap when we move into the world of probabilities. We are prone to making incorrect associations and false inferences that betray the underlying statistical relationships.\n\nThe journey from the casino floors of Las Vegas to the server rooms of Silicon Valley may seem a long one, but the underlying principles remain the same. Thorp showed us that by understanding volatility and designing systems to manage it, we can consistently win in a game designed for us to lose. By learning to \"count cards\" in our field - to read the shifting probabilities and adjust our strategies accordingly - we can turn the tables in our favor.\n\nThe key to mastering software development at scale lies not in our ability to predict the future but in our capacity to play with uncertainty. When we embrace the probabilistic nature of our work, we can unlock levels of efficiency and predictability that have eluded us. The question that concerns us is not how to make better plans but how to design systems that beat the plan, thrive, and even capitalize on uncertainty. This mindset shift will be one of the most crucial skills in the fascinating endeavor of large-scale software delivery."

            "article_content": "With the use of artificial intelligence, there is no recruitment solution today as efficient, complete, and fast as AI. Talent acquisition becomes further competitive because of AI-enabling recruitment tools like RecruitBPM, which are no longer options in the present recruitment landscape but have become necessity. With an increasingly sophisticated recruiting process, it helps companies to have more streamlined workflows so that the right candidate can be connected at the right time.\n\nArtificial intelligence in recruitment reached its peak in 2024. Most companies have now started believing in digital transformation; hence, AI recruiting software has become popular and is implemented on an enormous scale. This AI recruiting software enhances candidate screening with improved accuracy without any biases during the recruitment process and promotes diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe core secrets of these AI recruitment software are held within advanced algorithms which can sift through resumes, job descriptions, and even social media profiles, accurately identifying the ideal person for the job in a matter of minutes. By predictive analytics and automated candidate matching, AI recruiting tools help HR experts make fast and yet confident hiring decisions.\n\nThe more we move into the years to come, the merit and importance of AI recruiting software are coming to focus, as these tools have begun the transformation of organizations\u2019 talent acquisition and engagement processes for a more effective recruit-to-hire process. As time goes on, the prevailing trend will be for data-driven recruitment across organizations. In this advanced time, it is pretty sure that AI would keep organizations ahead of the curve by making hiring faster, smarter, and far better.\n\nThe Rise of AI in Recruitment SaaS\n\nArtificial intelligence has totally transformed the recruitment process, especially in the SaaS industry. The earlier method of recruitment used to take up a lot of time and was based on human instinct. However, AI recruiting software has changed all this. Now, it\u2019s fast and saves time because of data input. These days, through AI applications, one can search gigantic databases for perfect candidates. Using AI recruiting software saves plenty of time for the recruiter, so he gets to concentrate on more strategic decisions.\n\nIn addition, the most powerful trend in AI recruitment software is automation. These AI recruiting software are able to automatically filter through resumes for ranking based on qualification and even predict the compatibility with the culture of a company for the candidate. Organizations can save time and recruit based on objectivity and without bias.\n\nPredictive analytics is another crucial trend. The AI recruiting software can now help organizations predict their future hiring needs by looking at historical trends and market data on hiring. It allows the HR teams to be proactive instead of reactive, so they are always ready to identify talent when needed.\n\nThere is a tremendous business model evolution through which most companies have tended to settle to adopt the Subscription-Based models through Software as a Service to AI recruiting software for their business and that subscription model allows them flexibility because they change recruitment strategies without the burden of one-time, high-cost software purchases.\n\nAI recruitment software nowadays provides more integrated solutions through which holistic user experience comes about to hiring teams. These teams cut across posting job openings, sourcing candidates, tracking applicants, and managing various requisitions.\n\nAI has indeed transformed how recruitment goes in the SaaS space. It has ensured recruitment is smarter, faster, and less expensive. The face of recruitment will continue changing with AI recruiting software dominating more than ever.\n\nIndustry Trends to Watch\n\nWith AI changing the face of the recruiting environment, hundreds of other trends define the future leveraging AI recruiting tools like machine learning applications. Another trend is called Natural Language Processing, which allows technology to analyze resumes, job descriptions, and even interactions with recruiters and applicants. Gradually, software becomes so accurate that the tool tends to be even more predictive about who\u2019s going to be perfect for the seat, making it a fine hiring process as well.\n\nThe use of Natural Language Processing in resumes, job descriptions, and even in dialogue between recruiters and candidates. NLP enables AI recruiting software to understand the context in addition to the meaning in words, thus making it suitable for candidates\u2019 jobs with better accuracy. It has very much improved candidate screening as such AI tools can pick skills and experience most relevant in the absence of manual checking.\n\nAnother important advancement of AI recruiting software is in candidate screening. Traditional screening involves long hours of human review of resumes and applications, whereas modern AI recruiting software can automatically scan thousands of applications in a few seconds. These AI recruiting softwares can identify the most suitable candidates based on a combination of keywords, skills, and even patterns derived from previous hiring trends. This would fasten the process of recruitment and simultaneously ensure that more precise decisions are taken, which would be data-driven, as against the imperfections of human judgment.\n\nThese artificial intelligence trends are only evolving and setting new benchmarks with regard to the recruitment sectors. AI recruiting software is making the recruitment process efficient and effective in a manner that these artificial intelligence trends will surely hold for years in shaping their industry.\n\nMonetization Strategies for AI Recruiting Tools\n\nBusiness models for SaaS tools that support AI recruiting software change constantly. The most widely used monetization strategy is the subscription model. This model allows businesses to pay a recurring fee that depends on features and services in use and is flexible and scalable. This means there is always a steady income for the service provider; however, it allows the hiring customer to select the program that best fits the needs of hiring the best. Most AI recruiting software, including RecruitBPM, provide multilevel subscription plans as well, offering varying levels of access to premium features that include candidate matching and predictive analytics.\n\nAnother commonly used model is the freemium model. Here, AI recruiting software offers users free basic features to try out the tool before they decide to subscribe to any plan. This will attract a wide user base and help businesses gain the trust of potential clients. Once they realize the value of the AI recruiting software, they will be more than willing to upgrade to the paid version that offers the most advanced features. RecruitBPM does this by offering a free trial that prompts users to upgrade to a premium plan and provides access to rank automated candidates and advanced reports.\n\nMany companies follow pay-per-use or transactional pricing models, where a business pays according to the number of users or transactions processed in the long run. It is very attractive to smaller companies or startups that need the best AI recruiting software but do not have enough funds to subscribe fully.\n\nThus, firms with the best AI recruiting software, such as RecruitBPM, utilize flexible, scalable monetization strategies\u2014the subscription and freemium models\u2014which enable companies to be small or large yet still grow with time.\n\nTop AI Recruiting Tools for 2024\n\nArtificial intelligence is transforming the recruitment world as we speak; many innovative AI recruiting software tools are efficient, unique in features, and designed for enhancing hiring processes, rendering recruitment more quick, precise, and not biased in any way. Here are some of the first AI recruiting software expected in 2024, enumerated below, which have unique strengths and capabilities:\n\n1. RecruitBPM\n\nRecruitBPM is highly advanced AI recruiting software in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in the recruitment process. Its broad range of features, such as resume parsing, candidate matching, and automated job posting, will all be included in the solution. Thus, efficacy here is in its high, robust integration with HR\u2019s current systems, making it one nice resource for enhancing recruitment processes without damaging the integrity of the organization\u2019s current workflows. With the support of predictive analytics, it allows the selection of an applicant who best fits the needs of the job.\n\n2. HireVue\n\nHireVue improves the hiring process by video interviewing and assessment through artificial intelligence and machine learning. This AI recruiting software has artificial intelligence that evaluates the responses, facial expressions, and tone of voice of the candidates to ensure that they qualify for the job through this feature. Recruiters get candidates from any part of the world and save resources and time. Plus, with features like auto-scheduling interviews and candidate ranking, HireVue streamlines the recruitment process, making it indispensable for companies involved in mass recruitment.\n\n3. Jobvite\n\nAnother leading AI recruiting software is Jobvite. It uses AI in order to automatically screen candidates and connect with them. With an extremely customizable applicant tracking system (ATS) and job matching abilities using AI, this tool has the capability of sifting through volumes of candidate data and pinpointing who will be the best fit according to a combination of skills, experience, and cultural fit. Jobvite offers an integrated set of tools for recruiting, onboarding, and employee engagement, making it a holistic HR platform for recruitment needs.\n\n4. Pymetrics\n\nPymetrics applies the games of neuroscience and artificial intelligence to measure the cognitive and emotional aptitudes of applicants and then matches them with available openings based on an applicant\u2019s strengths. This AI recruitment software is found most popular in soft-skill industries. Pymetrics helps organizations reduce hiring bias and foster a better, more inclusive hiring strategy.\n\n5. SeekOut\n\nA hiring tool, SeekOut deploys AI to assist you in finding and engaging passive candidates. Its advanced search features using AI means that millions of profiles can be accessed in a very short span of time. Thus, organizations can reach out to passively job-seeking candidates as well. In addition, SeekOut has deep integrations with many recruiting platforms, which makes it pretty easy to use. It is especially useful for organizations that aim for diversity within their personnel as it is driven by diversity and inclusion.\n\nHow RecruitBPM Stands Out\n\nRecruitBPM stands out in the market for AI recruiting software through ease of usage and robust features with seamless integration with existing HR systems. Other competitors like RecruitCRM and Bullhorn are mainly focusing on ensuring that all components, ranging from sourcing candidates to client management, are included in this platform.\n\nOne of the biggest competitive benefits that RecruitBPM affords is that its workflow is configurable. Any company would tailor its recruiting approach so that each hiring cycle\u2019s specific needs are optimized by maximizing what one wants and needs, giving one flexibility on the very high end for a business aiming to have that solution in harmony with previously established practices rather than rigidly practiced.\n\nAnother feature is in the form of predictive analytics, whereby RecruitBPM uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data from previous hiring processes or market trends, thus allowing any human resources team to make more informed decisions about how to select candidates. Through predictive analytics, an organization can predict future hiring trends and, therefore, help the organization gain a competitive position in the talent market.\n\nMoreover, RecruitBPM\u2019s integration capabilities are more robust than most competitors\u2019. It integrates smoothly with all other human resources tools and assists companies in adopting AI recruiting software without interfering with existing workflows. Compared to RecruitCRM and Bullhorn, which may sometimes provide more complexity in integration, simplicity and efficiency give RecruitBPM an upper hand.\n\nIn conclusion, with possibilities of personalization and predictive analytics with integration that\u2019s as easy as possible, it makes RecruitBPM stand out amongst the best AI recruiting software providers thereby ranking it highly within premier software solutions tailored towards making organizational hiring better.\n\nOverlooked AI Features for Enhanced Recruiting\n\nWhile AI recruiting software is highly commended for streamlining the recruitment process, the most impactful features are often overlooked. Among the most beneficial yet underutilized features is diversity hiring predictive analytics. AI can analyze historical hiring data and make predictions about which candidates could help improve a more diversified and inclusive workforce. With such patterns found in previous hiring decisions, AI recruiting software can then suggest candidates that fulfill the required needs of a job while helping diversify teams, meaning companies will have better, more dynamic teams.\n\nOther notable features, although not often recalled, are those developed to eliminate bias. Traditional hiring does unconsciously foster bias over gender, race, and even age. AI recruiting software with a bias-detecting feature can scan for wording in job descriptions, CVs, and responses from interviews to detect instances where the wordings happen either consciously or unconsciously, so hiring decisions could rest purely on merit and appropriateness instead of biases. In addition, these features are of prime importance to any organization that strives for fair and equitable hiring practices.\n\nThese features are taking the recruitment approach to the next level with not only speed and efficiency but also fairness and long-term impact. With the constant growth of artificial intelligence, we can expect that even more of these capabilities can become integrated into recruitment to make businesses smarter and smarter about who they hire.\n\nIntegrating AI with Existing Workflows\n\nIntegrating AI with current human resource systems, including Applicant Tracking Systems, Customer Relationship Management, and Enterprise Resource Planning software, would greatly improve recruitment processes. However, proper planning and execution are necessary for seamless integration.\n\nAI tools can enhance ATS by automatically filtering candidates and suggesting AI-based recommendations for the most appropriate candidates. When used together with an ATS, AI recruiting software makes it easy to streamline candidate sourcing, improve job matching, reduce manual tasks, save time, and make better decisions.\n\nFurther integration can help recruiters converse even more efficiently with the candidates in the CRM system. AI algorithms could predict any candidate\u2019s possibility of accepting an offer put forth by a recruiter through his interactions, thereby personalizing his interactions for an even better experience in dealing with candidates. Automatically, candidate profiles can get updated with the new interaction, or resumes can update themselves from anywhere.\n\nWhile implementing artificial intelligence, aligning their recruitment activities is ensured for any ERP implementation. For example, AI recruiting software linked with the ERP of an organization makes sure hiring activities meet the organization\u2019s common objectives and targets on the company\u2019s budgetary planning as well as utilization of the company\u2019s resources. All this works by streamlining interdepartmental workflows so that recruitment would get what it requires at its proper time.\n\nThis will integrate AI with systems already in place to maximize and optimize both the AI tools and the systems already in play, producing a recruitment process that is more efficient, effective, and aligned.\n\nActionable Insights for Leveraging AI in 2024\n\nAs AI continues to evolve further into the recruitment industry, businesses must tap into the true potential of AI recruiting software. In order to get the best out of these tools, emphasis on automation, personalization, and analytics would be a means of making the hiring process smoother, better experience for the candidates, and data-driven decisions.\n\n1. Embrace Automation for Efficiency\n\nAI recruiting software is able to auto-operate, saving most recruiters much time by automating recurrent tasks like resume screening and job posting. The recruitment of the initial candidate and several other time-consuming activities are made easier by this automated system. For instance, AI recruiting software would automatically screen resumes, categorize, and match people with specific criteria to narrow down to the best possible applicants to be moved to the next level. This time allocation frees the Human Resources teams to focus more strategically on interviews as well as the building of relationships with potential candidates.\n\n2. Personalize Candidate Experience\n\nWhile automation will do most of the work, personalization is needed so that the candidate feels valued. Artificial Intelligence tools can make each candidate\u2019s recruitment process highly personalized. For instance, AI recruiting software can deliver job recommendations to the candidate, which are tailored and customized based on the candidate\u2019s employment history or profile. Furthermore, proper communication while interviewing as AI-driven chatbots will address questions the candidate raises, which will make the whole process smooth and engaging for the candidate while enhancing employer branding.\n\n3. Leverage Analytics for Data-Driven Decisions\n\nAI recruiting software is highly analytic and the data it will produce in the course of the recruitment process is crucial for the hiring process. Analyzing the earlier hiring cycles\u2019 data with AI will help find all patterns and predict what will be in the next set of hiring trends. From optimizing job descriptions that accurately predict which candidates will stand out in a given job to making decisions for hires judiciously based on facts rather than opinion.\n\nIn summary, the automation, personalization, and analytics integration in the recruitment process will make AI recruiting software usable in 2024. Collectively, these tools make the process more efficient but also provide better experiences for candidates, making it easier to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nOptimizing Candidate Experience with AI\n\nOne of the most important tools in helping with candidate experience is AI recruitment software. Among the most effective tools is AI chatbots, which respond to candidates immediately and give them responses in real-time. This chatbot can answer common questions about jobs, application statuses, and further steps. This keeps the candidate calm and relieved of any delay in the responses given to them, thus eliminating frustration and enhancing the general experience.\n\nAnother way AI-enabled tools can personalize the recruitment experience is through customizable communication. The AI recruiting software can understand a candidate\u2019s profile and preferences much better; therefore, message communication tailored to their needs makes the dialogue more relevant and interesting. It would build a better relationship with the candidates if tailored messages make them feel valued and understood. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to have a refined candidate\u2019s experience with personalized emails, customized job references, and automated follow-up which make the recruitment process less complicated and efficient.\n\nMeasuring AI ROI in Recruiting\n\nMeasurement of the return on investment will determine effectiveness: Of course, in AI recruiting software, ROI ought to be measured. Probably the way to measure success to some fair degree is KPIs like time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, and quality of hire, whereby companies could use these metrics to have judgments for whether the tools AI produces recruitment faster and possibly less cost and of superior quality.\n\nAnalytics dashboards give users access to real-time results for AI recruiting software effectiveness. In this regard, through the evaluation of candidate source, engagement, and conversion data, businesses will be aware of trends and areas that require improvement. As a result, this enables the organization to improve its recruitment process and therefore benefit more from the value added by the AI recruiting softwares, like spending much less time in hiring and increasing accuracy.\n\nChallenges and Solutions in AI Recruiting Software\n\nAI recruitment software has revolutionized the recruitment and hiring process; while in any other area, organizations must solve several barriers that stand in the way. The three major problems that arise while using AI for recruitment include data privacy, biases inherent in AI, and legacy system integration. However, again they are not unconquerable barriers, but as solutions that exist with every possibility.\n\n1. Data Privacy Concerns\n\nData privacy is a huge issue particularly in personal data: resumes, social media profiles, and interview answers. The usage of massive amounts of candidate information in AI tools requires respect for safe data handling along the lines of data protection law, which is in the case of the GDPR. Protection of data happens through safe cloud services along with encryption techniques. A system is audited from time to time for compliance.\n\nOrganizations should be transparent to candidates about their use and storage of information. Such implementations of explicit consent forms together with allowing the candidate not to participate in data collection would help increase the trust between candidates and the overall candidate experience.\n\n2. AI Bias\n\nBias is another challenge AI recruiting software can undermine effectiveness. The basis of AI tools is that they are built from historical data, and then systems can inherit biases from data and lead to inconsistant hiring decisions. This might affect diversity and inclusion as a certain number of demographics are favored more than others.\n\nCompanies should ensure that the datasets that their AI recruiting software is trained upon are diversified and updated by the changing standards of the industry over time. Most of the AI tools available in use have fairness algorithms built that identify and rectify bias at every step in the recruitment process. Human oversight has to be incorporated into the AI, so hiring decisions made by AI should be fair and not biased.\n\n3. Integration with Existing Systems\n\nOne of the major challenges is that it is not easy to integrate AI recruitment software with already prevalent Applicant Tracking Systems and Human Resource Information Systems. Therefore, as a result, organizations may struggle to fully realize the benefits of AI recruitment due to poor integration.\n\nAppropriate solution includes the selection of AI recruiting software that promise stress-free integration with the current software. Many top-rated AI recruiting software solutions such as RecruitBPM have been developed to integrate seamlessly with the existing systems; this enables organizations to automate workflows, enhance candidate screening, and generally improve efficiency without interrupting the running businesses.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe most significant tool that would assist the organization in improving its recruiting practices in 2024 under the influence of artificial intelligence would redefine methods of recruiting and selection. By optimizing a range of functions\u2014from candidate screening to job matching and interview scheduling\u2014AI recruiting software frees human resources from tactical decision-making, increasing both efficiency and fairness. Hence, it also lets you communicate directly with applicants and provides dashboards that show helpful insights into the recruitment process.\n\nRecruitBPM is one of the best AI Recruiting Software that boasts unique features in a very competitive market. Its all-inclusive and user-friendly interface is easily integrated with existing HR systems to provide effective solutions. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools from job posting to candidate engagement, plus enhances recruitment and business growth.\n\nReady to take your hiring process to the next level? Look no further than RecruitBPM. With this powerful and best AI recruiting software, the potential for improving recruitment results, attracting top talent, and maintaining a competitive advantage in 2024 and beyond is limitless.\u200b\n\nFAQs\n\nHow is AI being used in recruiting?\n\nExamples include AI in hiring, where AI-powered chatbots engage candidates and respond to queries in real time, thus improving communication and candidate experience as well. Resumes are parsed by machine learning systems, which then identify those skills and expertise that line up with job descriptions.\n\nWhat is an AI sourcing tool?\n\nSince it entirely automates the hiring process, it is a time-saving tool that helps companies. For example, AI sourcing eliminates the tedious and time-consuming nature of Boolean searches because it scans job titles, candidate resumes, job skills, and other related metrics such as time-to-hire and cost-to-hire quite quickly.\n\nWhat is the future of AI in recruitment?\n\nAI\u2019s future directions in the hiring process include efficiency improvement and elimination of bias by means of automated critical operations. Through technology, AI recruiting software utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms and optimizes resume screening, candidate matching, and interview analysis. For instance, if artificial intelligence is used to automate the sourcing process, such as RecruitBPM does, it makes it possible for recruiters to quickly and easily obtain the best talent. Hence, it means a faster hiring process, but it becomes even more accurate and objective as a whole.\n\nWhat is the future of AI in HR?\n\nAI in HR will significantly affect recruitment, talent acquisition, and employee management. With artificial intelligence, organizations can automatically screen through the resumes, rank the candidates, and analyze the interview. This will, therefore, make hiring streamlined and fairer. For instance, RecruitBPM uses artificial intelligence that optimizes the recruitment workflow where candidates are given higher rates of match faster. It will also be determined that using AI-driven tools improves candidate quality, reduces hiring time by up to 40%, and, in the process, makes a better workforce."

            "article_content": "A well-known test for artificial general intelligence (AGI) is getting close to being solved, but the test\u2019s creators say this points to flaws in the test\u2019s design rather than a bonafide breakthrough in research.\n\nIn 2019, Francois Chollet, a leading figure in the AI world, introduced the ARC-AGI benchmark, short for \u201cAbstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence.\u201d Designed to evaluate whether an AI system can efficiently acquire new skills outside the data it was trained on, ARC-AGI, Francois claims, remains the only AI test to measure progress towards general intelligence (although others have been proposed.)\n\nUntil this year, the best-performing AI could only solve just under a third of the tasks in ARC-AGI. Chollet blamed the industry\u2019s focus on large language models (LLMs), which he believes aren\u2019t capable of actual \u201creasoning.\u201d\n\n\u201cLLMs struggle with generalization, due to being entirely reliant on memorization,\u201d he said in a series of posts on X in February. \u201cThey break down on anything that wasn\u2019t in their training data.\u201d\n\nTo Chollet\u2019s point, LLMs are statistical machines. Trained on a lot of examples, they learn patterns in those examples to make predictions \u2014 like how \u201cto whom\u201d in an email typically precedes \u201cit may concern.\u201d\n\nChollet asserts that while LLMs might be capable of memorizing \u201creasoning patterns,\u201d it\u2019s unlikely they can generate \u201cnew reasoning\u201d based on novel situations. \u201cIf you need to be trained on many examples of a pattern, even if it\u2019s implicit, in order to learn a reusable representation for it, you\u2019re memorizing,\u201d Chollet argued in another post.\n\nTo incentivize research beyond LLMs, in June, Chollet and Zapier co-founder Mike Knoop launched a $1 million competition to build an open-source AI capable of beating ARC-AGI. Out of 17,789 submissions, the best scored 55.5% \u2014 about 20% higher than 2023\u2019s top scorer, albeit short of the 85%, \u201chuman-level\u201d threshold required to win.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re 20% closer to AGI, though, Knoop says.\n\nIn a blog post, Knoop said that many of the submissions to ARC-AGI have been able to \u201cbrute force\u201d their way to a solution, suggesting that a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of ARC-AGI tasks \u201c[don\u2019t] carry much useful signal towards general intelligence.\u201d\n\nARC-AGI consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to generate the correct \u201canswer\u201d grid from a collection of different-colored squares. The problems were designed to force an AI to adapt to new problems it hasn\u2019t seen before. But it\u2019s not clear they\u2019re achieving this.\n\nTasks in the ARC-AGI benchmark. Models must solve \u2018problems\u2019 in the top row; the bottom row shows solutions. Image Credits:ARC-AGI\n\n\u201c[ARC-AGI] has been unchanged since 2019 and is not perfect,\u201d Knoop acknowledged in his post.\n\nFrancois and Knoop have also faced criticism for overselling ARC-AGI as a benchmark toward reaching AGI, especially since the very definition of AGI is being hotly contested now. One OpenAI staff member recently claimed that AGI has \u201calready\u201d been achieved if one defines AGI as AI \u201cbetter than most humans at most tasks.\u201d\n\nKnoop and Chollet say they plan to release a second-gen ARC-AGI benchmark to address these issues, alongside a competition in 2025. \u201cWe will continue to direct the efforts of the research community towards what we see as the most important unsolved problems in AI, and accelerate the timeline to AGI,\u201d Chollet wrote in an X post.\n\nFixes likely won\u2019t be easy. If the first ARC-AGI test\u2019s shortcomings are any indication, defining intelligence for AI will be as intractable \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 as it has been for human beings."

My timeframe tends to be between 3-24 months.I like stocks that have experienced a recent sell-off due to non-recurrent events, particularly when insiders are buying shares at the new lower price. This is how I often screen through thousands of stocks, mainly in the US, although I may own shares in banana republics. I use fundamental analysis to check the health of companies that pass through my screening process, their leverage, and then compare their financial ratios with the sector, and industry median and average. I also do professional background checks of each insider who purchased shares after the recent sell-off. I use technical analysis to optimize the entry and exit points of my positions. I mainly use multicolor lines for support and resistance levels on weekly charts. From time to time I draw trend lines, taken for granted, in multicolor patterns.

            "article_content": "The economy in rural America starts and stops with the American farmer.\n\nAmid the deafening noise inside political echo chambers and ceaseless squabbling of Congress is one truth that we cannot ignore- we are a nation united in reliance on our farmers.\n\nWithout the American farmer, there is no adequate tax base for our school systems, local municipalities, or any services that rural Americans need to live and prosper in this country.\n\nEverybody eats, and we all need the food and fiber that our farmers produce to live. No one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of food, just like no one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. Right now, our farmers need our help.\n\nHurricane Helene caused a devastating blow to Georgia's No. 1 industry, with over $6.4 billion in agricultural economic loss alone.\n\nIf we fail to provide agriculture-specific appropriations to help our farmers before the end of the year, we will see widespread, lasting economic loss across all of rural southeast America, especially in Georgia.\n\nAs I traveled across Georgia's 8th Congressional District in the immediate aftermath of Helene, I saw the devastation to our farms firsthand. From hundreds of demolished poultry houses and cotton fields in Coffee County to decimated pecan orchards in Berrien and Lowndes counties and vegetable rows and fruit bushes in ruins across Clinch County, it is clear that our farmers need immediate assistance.\n\nCongress cannot stop a hurricane, but we can fix the unnatural disasters that our farmers face to aid their recovery.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, R-Pa., Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., visited Georgia's 8th District with me recently to survey the damage after Helene across south Georgia and north Florida. Our farmers need help, and I appreciate the chairman and others taking the time to meet with them firsthand so we can better work together for relief.\n\nUnfortunately, trouble for our nation's farmers began far before Hurricane Helene. Since the last farm bill was passed in 2018, our farmers and nation have experienced excessively challenging events that have changed the political landscape in which we need to navigate to properly support the best stewards of our land.\n\nRelated Articles Opinion: The dire state of the American farm economy\n\nWith rising input costs, including the increased cost of labor, diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed, farming is more expensive than it has ever been in our country.\n\nGeorgia's farmers were also horribly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused more than $2.5 billion in losses to the state's agriculture industry. It took approximately 24 months for our farmers to get relief after Hurricane Michael, and I can assure you that the majority of producers and rural communities that Helene hit cannot survive another 24 months without something being done.\n\nAmerica's farmers are also suffering from the unnaturally disastrous policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which have contributed to record inflation and the rising cost of energy and food production.\n\nThere has to be a strong safety net to keep good farmers farming through bad years like this one. If you are an American who eats, you should deeply care about the passage of a comprehensive farm bill that prioritizes production agriculture.\n\nEarlier this year, the House Agriculture Committee passed the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (the farm bill). This legislation includes critical updates to reference prices and several of my priorities to ensure a strong farm safety net by expanding crop insurance options to specialty crops, all of which would greatly assist producers in times of natural disaster.\n\nHowever, this bill is stalled in Congress, and the Senate Democrats just released a half-baked last-minute \"farm bill\" just to look like they did something, further fueling the fear of the forgotten farmer as they struggle to feed us.\n\nWhen the American farmer stops farming, rural communities collapse because their core and main economic driver is gone. We need to give farmers the support they need to keep farming with the confidence to know they are not forgotten.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress passes both the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and an agriculture-specific disaster relief appropriations package before the end of the year so that our farmers can continue feeding our nation and supporting our rural communities.\n\nRepublican Rep. Austin Scott represents the 8th District of Georgia and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee."

            "article_content": "Progressives have suddenly found themselves lost in the political wilderness, caught in a self-inflicted trap of anger and fear. From the sound of their fury, they could be there for a long while. (Thoughts and prayers.)\n\nWith Democrats now irrelevant, the second Trump administration has four years to take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment, including deep cuts to federal spending and an overhaul of the bloated bureaucracy.\n\nTo understand why the wrecking ball is needed, look at the annual budget deficit \u2212 $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. In a time of relative peace and prosperity, the deficit grew 8% in one year, even though federal revenue increased by 11%. In other words, the Biden-Harris administration collected significantly more money from taxpayers in the last fiscal year but still managed to blow up the deficit by an additional $138 billion. That's simply unsustainable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter President-elect Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMusk operates at another level, building the most valuable automaker in the world in Tesla and the most important entity (public or private) in space travel and satellite communications with SpaceX.\n\nCan Musk succeed where Obama's Simpson-Bowles failed?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump joins SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to view the launching of the aerospace company's Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIf Musk and Ramaswamy are able to accomplish even a portion of what they envision \u2212 cutting $2 trillion in government spending \u2012 it could provide a remarkable boost for our economy.\n\n\"They're going to need inside Washington budget experts like ex-Capitol Hill staffers and the like,\" Chris Edwards, a Cato Institute economist who specializes in government spending, told me. \"People (who) used to be on the budget committees on Capitol Hill and used to work for the (Office of Management and Budget). They're going to need those sorts of people to tell them exactly how and what they can cut.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to cut government spending. In 2010, President Barack Obama created the Simpson-Bowles commission to recommend budget cuts that would trim the deficit over a 10-year period.\n\nThe commission's recommendations failed to gain traction in Congress. In fact, the federal government has added about $16 trillion to the national debt since Simpson-Bowles was created. So there's reason for cynicism. Trump and Congress will need to actually cut the programs Musk and Ramaswamy recommend, even if the president needs to use his veto power to do it.\n\nOpinion: Trump can fix what Biden broke. But he needs to seize the moment and stay on task.\n\nEdwards said Republicans need to be serious about deficit reduction starting next year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"(Republicans) need to at least show deficits kind of on a downward path,\" the Cato economist told me. \"They don't have to do a massive spending cut next year, but they've got to show financial markets and the Federal Reserve that the deficits are on a downward path.\"\n\nIt's a misconception that the executive branch doesn't play an important role in how the economy functions. The massive federal deficit helps fuel inflation. And as Edwards noted, \"The deficits and debt are so large now we're in uncharted financial territory for this country.\"\n\nDOGE should cut this department first\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy endorses former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in Atkinson, N.H., on Jan. 16, 2024.\n\nThe Cato economist said DOGE could start to deliver better efficiency by initially focusing on a popular but underperforming section of the budget. A proposal to target federal spending on K-12 education might seem radical, but it also would signal that Musk and Ramaswamy are serious.\n\n\"K-12 schools is easily the biggest and most attractive opportunity for Trump and his team to cut,\" Edwards said. \"George W. Bush made a big show of signing the No Child Left Behind legislation ... and greatly increased federal subsidies and federal intrusion into the schools. That obviously failed. Test scores are down. I think today's Republican Party has completely changed on education. ... There's been the huge success of school choice.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion: Voters strongly rebuke Democrats by electing Trump. But will progressives listen?\n\nI second Edwards' suggestion.\n\nWhile public schools are necessary, more and more spending hasn't led to better results.\n\nThe Department of Education's budget for this fiscal year is almost $80 billion \u2012 nearly $10 billion more than the enacted budget only five years ago.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

Michel published an article that recommended $4.8 trillion in specific cuts over the next 10 years, including selling off Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and transforming Medicaid funding by sending block grants to the states.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDemocrats are sure to whine about those ideas and others. Republicans should ignore them and focus instead on saving taxpayers' money, getting the deficit under control and saving America from an economic disaster that will hit if the nation stays on its current course.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

            "article_content": "After Valve got a lot of PC gamers excited about gaming handhelds with its popular Steam Deck, the company appears to be working with third-party manufacturers on a comeback of Steam machines. The timing seems right now that SteamOS, Valve\u2019s Linux-based OS is a much better alternative to Windows when it comes to ease of use and game compatibility.\n\nYou may remember that back in 2015, Valve got Alienware and other manufacturers to release a couple of Steam machines for the living room. Valve even released its own Steam controller for these console-like devices, but these first Steam machines were probably ahead of their time. Indeed, that was before Valve started to invest in the Proton compatibility layer that made the most popular Windows games run seamlessly on SteamOS.\n\nWindows Intelligence In Your Inbox Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday \u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! \"*\" indicates required fields Email * Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nOver the summer, Valve confirmed to The Verge that it was working to make SteamOS compatible with third-party gaming handhelds such as the Asus ROG Ally. The latter ships with Windows 11, which is great for gamers who want to use PC Game Pass or install other game launchers like Gog or the Epic Games Store. However, Windows 11 isn\u2019t optimized for running on devices with a 7-inch display like the ROG Ally. It also doesn\u2019t help that Asus and other manufacturers of Windows-based gaming handhelds are all building custom overlays that aren\u2019t easy to use and may sometimes clash with Windows features.\n\nOver the weekend, The Verge published a detailed roundup of all the things Valve appears to be working on right now to grow the SteamOS ecosystem. That includes a new Steam controller and what could be a new living room Steam box codenamed \u201cFremont.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the company also updated a Brand guidelines document that includes the new \u201cPowered by SteamOS\u201d logo you can see at the top of this article. The document says this logo will be used \u201cfor hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.\u201d\n\nIf Valve\u2019s Steam Deck proved that there was an appetite for gaming handhelds providing seamless access to Steam games, Valve could significantly grow the SteamOS ecosystem with the help of third-party manufacturers. Unlike Windows, SteamOS is free, and it\u2019s optimized for gaming handhelds and the living room experience. Moreover, gamers don\u2019t need to pay a subscription like Xbox Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus to play the Steam version of multiplayer games.\n\nAs of today, Valve is making SteamOS free to install for anyone, though the installation process is quite technical and the OS only supports a certain set of hardware. However, this new \u201cPowered by SteamOS logo\u201d suggests that may soon see third-party devices shipping with SteamOS out of the box. Whether that includes both gaming handhelds and console-like devices for the living room remains to be seen, however."

            "article_content": "For many years, OnePlus has attempted to challenge Samsung's supremacy as the top manufacturer of Android smartphones. Although OnePlus phones have come very close to being the greatest Android smartphones available, they still need to catch up in several crucial areas. For example, the OnePlus 12, which was released at the beginning of this year, included:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAn optical in-display fingerprint scanner.\n\nAn IP64 rating.\n\nFour years of OS upgrades.\n\nWith the OnePlus 13, which may be the Chinese smartphone manufacturer's first actual flagship phone and could eventually compete with Samsung's top-tier models, OnePlus has addressed many of these problems. Let's compare the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13 and learn the main differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePuls 13 smartphones.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Design\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Known for its high-end construction, the S25 Ultra is anticipated to have a titanium frame with a rounded shape, increasing durability while preserving a stylish appearance. For consumers who value productivity, the S Pen's addition offers utility.\n\nOnePlus 13: With an aluminum frame and a circular camera module, the OnePlus 13 takes on a more contemporary appearance. It might be better made than the S25 Ultra, but it still has a fashionable and functional design.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Display\n\nAdvertisment\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Featuring a 6.8-inch QHD+ display with a resolution of 3088 x 1440 pixels , this model is expected to support a refresh rate of 144Hz , ensuring smooth visuals and an immersive experience.\n\nOnePlus 13 also sports a 6.8-inch display with a slightly higher resolution at 3168 x 1440 pixels. However, it is rumored to have a refresh rate of 120Hz, which is still impressive but may not match the ultra-smooth experience of the S25 Ultra.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Camera\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : With a powerful 200 MP primary camera and extra sensors for telephoto and ultra-wide photos, this phone promises to be an excellent photographer, especially in low light.\n\nOnePlus 13: With two extra 50 MP sensors for telephoto and ultra-wide photography, the OnePlus 13 boasts a multipurpose camera configuration. Its camera system is made for versatility and high-quality photos, even though it might not have as many megapixels is the S25 Ultra.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Battery Life\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Expected to house a 5,000 mAh battery , which may be optimized through software improvements like Battery AI to enhance longevity during intensive use.\n\nOnePlus 13: It boasts a larger 6,000 mAh battery, promising extended usage times, which is especially beneficial for heavy users who prioritize battery life.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Charging Speeds\n\nAdvertisment\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Anticipated to support up to 45W wired charging and potentially increase wireless charging speeds from 15W to 25W.\n\nOnePlus 13: This model is set to offer rapid charging capabilities with up to 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, making it one of the fastest charging options available.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Pricing\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is projected to be priced around \u20b91,24,990.\n\nIn contrast, the OnePlus 13 offers an attractive price point starting at \u20b964,990, making it a more budget-friendly option without compromising essential features.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nComparing the prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13\n\nApple had drastically lowered the pricing of its iPhone 16 Pro lineup due to the Indian government lowering import taxes on handsets and associated parts. Nevertheless, it is still being determined whether Samsung will maintain the Galaxy S25 Ultra's prices from the previous year or decrease. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra started for \u20b91,29,999 in India last year. By contrast, the OnePlus 12 started at \u20b964,999 in the nation. While the OnePlus 13's price is anticipated to increase, it should still be significantly less expensive than the Samsung substitute and have many of the same features. Limited software support and the absence of a 5x telephoto lens are two areas where the OnePlus 13 might fall short of the S25 Ultra.\n\nOnePlus 13: Specifications\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccording to the China specifications, the OnePlus 13 is anticipated to include a 6.82-inch BOE X2 2K+ AMOLED screen with a maximum brightness of 4,500 nits, 2160Hz PWM dimming, and the first DisplayMate A++ certification in history.\n\nA 50MP Sony LYT 808 primary sensor, a 50MP Sony LYT600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP Samsung JN1 ultra-wide angle lens make up the triple camera configuration on the rear of the OnePlus 13. There is a 32MP Sony IMX612 front-facing camera for taking selfies and making video calls.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which has a fantastic AnTuTu score of 3.18 million, powers the OnePlus 13, as was previously announced. The device supports up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage and 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM. The OnePlus 13 has IP68 and IP69 ratings to protect against dust and water. Additionally, it has an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which is an improvement over the OnePlus 12's optical sensor.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Specifications\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to keep its titanium frame from the previous model year, making it one of the most robust phones available. In contrast, the OnePlus 13 will probably have an aluminum frame, which is sturdy but pales compared to titanium.\n\nCompared to the OnePlus 13, the phone is anticipated to have a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with Gorilla Glass Armor protection, making the screen less reflective and more resilient. The Samsung phone may have an advantage due to its higher transfer speed, even though the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra should have at least 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. According to rumors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will include UFS 4.04, which might double transfer rates above the OnePlus 13's UFS 4.0 storage.\n\nA 200MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x zoom, and a 50MP periscope lens with 5x magnification are all part of the triple camera arrangement that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to have. There ought to be a 12MP selfie camera on the front.\n\nWith a 50MP 5x periscope camera, the Galaxy S25 Ultra considerably outperforms the OnePlus 13 despite having a higher resolution ultra-wide angle lens. However, Samsung is unlikely to go to quicker charging speeds, and the S25 Ulta will probably have the same 45W wired and 25W wireless charging capabilities. With faster wired and wireless charging and support for magnetic charging, OnePlus leads the field in this area.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is exceptional in its high-end construction, cutting-edge camera technology, and valuable tools like the S Pen. In contrast, the OnePlus 13 distinguishes itself by its competitive cost, faster charging options, and greater battery capacity. Whether you favor value-driven performance or luxury features will determine which option best suits your needs."

The company's shares have soared over 80% so far this year.\n\n\"Oracle has a long history of beating estimates so even a small miss rattles Wall Street,\" said Rebecca Wettemann, CEO of industry analyst firm Valoir, adding that analysts' expectations for AI companies are \"overheated\".\n\nOracle reported revenue of $14.06 billion in the second quarter, up 9% from a year ago, but below estimates of $14.11 billion, as per data compiled by LSEG.\n\nTo gain market share in the competitive environment, Oracle has partnered with these so-called cloud hyperscalers by embedding its database architecture within Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's web clouds, allowing customers to connect data across various applications.\n\nOracle's chief executive Safra Catz said total Oracle cloud revenue should top $25 billion in fiscal 2025 and reiterated that annual capital expenditure would be double this fiscal year.\n\n\"While the Cloud business remained strong, it is requiring an exponential increase in capex, which is leading to margin pressure. We expect Oracle to remain a distant fourth hyperscaler in spite of this investment,\" said DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\n\nThe company has been pouring billions into upgrading its cloud infrastructure by buying hardware from chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and setting up cloud facilities to close the gap with industry leaders.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.47 per share, compared with estimates of a profit of $1.48 per share. It forecast third-quarter adjusted EPS between $1.50 and $1.54, while analysts expected $1.57."

            "article_content": "Home Opinion The theology of Christmas: The Incarnation\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds in history, transformed our understanding of the universe. His theory of relativity reshaped physics, while his discovery of the photoelectric effect won him the Nobel Prize in 1921. Yet, for all his genius, Einstein famously dismissed trivial facts. When asked how many feet are in a mile, he replied, \u201cI do not clutter my mind with insignificant information that I can find in less than two minutes in a book.\u201d\n\nThough Einstein acknowledged a divine order in the universe, he rejected the God of the Bible \u2014 the personal God who is both knowable and redemptive. He once remarked, \u201cThe more I study science, the more I believe in God,\u201d but tragically, he never came to know the one true and living God.\n\nThis contrast between human intellect and divine revelation sets the stage for John 1:14, a verse that declares the profound truth at the heart of Christmas: \u201cThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d In this one staggering statement in John 1:14, we see a God who enters His creation, reveals His glory, and provides grace and truth for fallen sinners.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe Word became flesh\n\nJohn begins this verse with a profound declaration: \u201cThe Word became flesh.\u201d This phrase encapsulates the mystery of the incarnation, where the eternal Logos took on human nature without ceasing to be divine.\n\nThe term Logos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) was familiar to John\u2019s Greek and Jewish audiences, but John redefines it in the opening of his Gospel. For Greek philosophers like Heraclitus, the Logos referred to the rational principle and non-personal deity governing the universe. But John declares that the Logos (Word) is not an impersonal force but a person \u2014 Jesus Christ, who was both with God and was God (John 1:1).\n\nJesus, the eternal Word, is the Creator of all things (John 1:3). He is the \u201cI AM\u201d who declared, \u201cBefore Abraham was, I AM\u201d (John 8:58) and \u201cI and the Father are one\u201d (John 10:30). Jesus is sovereign over creation, having formed humanity in His image, established the laws of nature, and upholds the cosmos by His power. As the Nicene Creed affirms, He is \u201cvery God of very God,\u201d worthy of all worship.\n\nJohn\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe Word became flesh\u201d unveils the miracle of the incarnation. The eternal Son of God entered His creation by taking on human nature. This is the mystery that Thomas Watson called \u201cthe infinite love of God.\u201d Christ did not cease to be God but added humanity to His deity, becoming truly God and truly man.\n\nConsider the humility of the incarnation: the creator of the universe was born in a lowly stable, veiled in flesh, and subjected to the limitations of humanity in his human nature. Charles Wesley beautifully captures this truth in his hymn:\n\n\u201cVeiled in flesh the Godhead see,\n\nHail th\u2019incarnate Deity,\n\nPleased with us in flesh to dwell,\n\nJesus, our Immanuel.\u201d\n\nThe incarnation is not only a theological truth but a deeply personal one. Without the Word becoming flesh, humanity would remain lost in sin, alienated from God. As Watson reminds us, \u201cHad not Christ been made flesh, we had been made a curse.\u201d\n\nThe Word tabernacled among us\n\nJohn continues, \u201cand dwelt among us.\u201d The Greek word for \u201cdwelt\u201d (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c9) means \u201cto take up residence, or to pitch a tent,\u201d evoking the imagery of the Old Testament tabernacle where God\u2019s presence dwelled among His people.\n\nIn Exodus, God commanded Moses to construct the tabernacle, a portable sanctuary where His presence would reside. The tabernacle was central to Israel\u2019s worship, housing the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark\u2019s mercy seat was the place of atonement, where the high priest sprinkled the sacrificial blood once per year on the Day of Atonement.\n\nThis structure symbolized God\u2019s desire to dwell among His people, yet it was limited by layers of separation. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once every year. When John writes that Jesus \u201cdwelt among us,\u201d he declares that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle. Unlike the temporary, veiled presence of God in the Old Testament, in the person of Jesus God\u2019s presence is fully revealed. As Hebrews 1:3 states, He is \u201cthe radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of His nature.\u201d\n\nThrough Christ, humanity can approach God directly, without fear or separation. He is not only the greater High Priest who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice, but he is the greater tabernacle granting access to the Father for all who believe. This is the wonder and thrilling truth of the birth of Jesus that is celebrated at Christmas.\n\nThe Word revealed the glory of God\n\nJohn writes, \u201cWe have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.\u201d The incarnation reveals the radiant glory of God in a way that humanity could see, hear, feel, and touch.\n\nThroughout Scripture, God\u2019s glory is depicted as overwhelming and unapproachable. At Mount Sinai, God\u2019s presence was so terrifying that the Israelites trembled in fear (Exodus 19). When Moses asked to see God\u2019s glory, he was only permitted a partial glimpse, for no one could see God and live (Exodus 33:20). In the tabernacle and later the temple, God\u2019s glory filled the sanctuary, yet it remained hidden behind the veil.\n\nIn Jesus, the glory of God is fully revealed. At the transfiguration, Peter, James, and John witnessed His divine majesty shining through His humanity (Matthew 17:2). After His resurrection, Paul encountered the risen Christ in glory, a vision so blinding it left him temporarily blind (Acts 9:3\u20139).\n\nJesus\u2019 miracles also revealed His glory, demonstrating His divine authority over sickness, nature, and even death. From calming the storm to raising Lazarus, each miracle pointed to His identity as the Son of God. Even as Jesus\u2019 deity was clothed in human flesh, it could not veil his glory. Throughout his earthly ministry, bursts of glory and rays of his majesty are visibly seen in his powerful miracles. Yet, the greatest display of His glory was seen in His humility and suffering. On the cross, Jesus bore the wrath of God for sinners, displaying the glory of divine love and justice and the vindication of it all was his glorious resurrection.\n\nThe Word delivered grace and truth\n\nFinally, John declares that Jesus is \u201cfull of grace and truth.\u201d These two attributes summarize the purpose of the incarnation: to bring salvation through grace and to reveal the truth of God.\n\nGrace is the unmerited favor of God toward sinners. In Jesus, grace is personified and extended to all who believe. As Paul writes, \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God\u201d (Ephesians 2:8). From His first breath in Bethlehem to His final cry on the cross, Jesus\u2019 life was marked by grace. He came not to condemn the world but to save it (John 3:17). His death and resurrection provide eternal life to those who trust in Him.\n\nJesus not only embodies grace but also truth. He declared, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). In a world filled with deception, Jesus stands as the ultimate standard of truth. His teachings reveal the truth about God, humanity, and salvation. He exposed the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, corrected false interpretations of Scripture, and proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom. As the Spirit of Truth, Jesus sanctifies believers, transforming them into His likeness through the power of the Word (John 17:17).\n\nThe incarnation is the foundation of the Christian faith. In Jesus, the eternal Word became flesh, dwelt among us, revealed God\u2019s glory, and brought grace and truth to a lost world. As we celebrate Christmas, let us marvel at the humility and majesty of Christ, who entered His creation to redeem it. And let us live in anticipation of the day when He will dwell with His people forever:\n\n\u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God\u201d (Revelation 21:3).\n\nThis is the true theology of Christmas: God became man so that we might dwell with Him in glory. Let us worship the incarnate Word, our Immanuel.\n\nOriginally published at G3 Ministries."

Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe\u2014life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy\u2014or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \"self-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\" That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

It can describe how a group of something becomes more complex \u2013 or even just different \u2013 over time.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe\u2014biological or not\u2014to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules\u2014at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it\u2014for life as we don't know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

            "article_content": "Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nIllustration by Midjourney.\n\nIn late 2022, the world collectively held its breath as a strange yet exciting new technology emerged from the depths of Silicon Valley. This was ChatGPT \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that could write poetry, debug code, and summarize hundred-page novels with unnerving ease. It attracted a jaw-dropping 100 million users within weeks, breaking records for the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Investors, with visions of a technological revolution shimmering in their eyes (and dollar signs for pupils), began pouring fortunes into anything that bore the acronym \u201cAI.\u201d The future, it seemed, was already here.\n\nBut, as history reminds us with a wry smile, the future doesn\u2019t always arrive as advertised. As the markets ride a wave of AI-induced euphoria, voices of caution are growing louder. Is AI a transformative technology poised to rewrite our lives, or is it the scaffolding for the next catastrophic bubble \u2014 a modern-day echo of the dot-com collapse?\n\nEchoes of 1999\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to close with a 27% gain, building on a 24% surge the year before. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of back-to-back bull run since the halcyon days of the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks inflated to absurd heights. For a brief moment, it seemed every startup with a \u201c.com\u201d in its name was a ticket to unimaginable wealth. But by early 2000, that story turned dark. The bubble popped, and what followed was a painful recession that many would rather forget. By 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion. Today, a similar stock market wipeout could be much more dire.\n\nFor instance, at the peak of the dot-com frenzy, Pets.com seemed to embody the future of commerce. Who wouldn\u2019t want pet supplies delivered with just a few clicks? The company launched in 1998, armed with an irresistible mascot: a wide-eyed sock puppet with a penchant for witty banter. The puppet became a minor celebrity, starring in a $1.2 million Super Bowl ad and even appearing on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut beneath the charm lay a fragile business model. Shipping bulky bags of dog food wasn\u2019t cheap, and Pets.com sold products at a loss just to attract customers. Investors still believed in the vision, pumping $82.5 million into its IPO in February 2000. Nine months later, the company collapsed. The sock puppet, once a symbol of internet-age optimism, became the unwitting face of dot-com hubris.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, the undisputed titan of AI hardware, have seen their market value soar to over $3 trillion. In just two years, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged eightfold. Super Micro Computer, which provides the servers powering AI\u2019s voracious data needs, has followed a similar trajectory. The technology that underpins this growth is genuinely astounding. Yet, as the Associated Press notes, it\u2019s hard to ignore how similar these patterns feel to the 1999 bubble \u2014 a time when investors believed the early internet would mint millionaires out of thin air.\n\nEven the European Central Bank has begun sounding the alarm. In a recent financial review, the ECB warned of an AI stock bubble, suggesting that if AI firms don\u2019t start producing tangible profits, panic could ripple through the global economy. The more feverish the hype, the harder the fall if reality fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThis concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAlso, in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s just too much optimism and not enough recognition of what could derail stock momentum, experts seem to warn.\n\nIs This The World\u2019s Most Expensive Gamble?\n\nAnd yet, despite the red flags, the AI juggernaut barrels forward. According to estimates, spending on AI data centers from 2024 to 2027 will exceed $1.4 trillion. These facilities, filled with server racks humming under the weight of immense computation, are the new temples of progress. But as impressive as this investment sounds, only a sliver of American businesses \u2014 about 5% \u2014 have incorporated AI into their services.\n\nThe disparity between investor enthusiasm and business adoption is becoming hard to ignore. While ChatGPT dazzled millions, the electricity needed to train its underlying model, GPT-4, could have powered over three million electric vehicles for an entire year. OpenAI\u2019s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023 \u2014 but it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.\n\nEach new leap in AI capability requires ever more data, ever more energy, and ever more money. It\u2019s a cycle that feels less like a virtuous circle and more like an arms race, spiraling toward a point of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of these constraints are fueling an industry-wide scramble for efficiency. Companies are developing specialized chips and streamlined models to mitigate AI\u2019s insatiable hunger for resources. Yet, as of now, the promises are still largely theoretical.\n\nWhat happens if the money \u2014 and patience \u2014 runs out before the solutions arrive?\n\nThe Silent Revolution in the Office Cubicle\n\nCuriously, while corporations debate the merits of AI, employees are embracing it in secret. Studies suggest that a third of American workers use AI at least once a week, often without their bosses\u2019 knowledge. In some sectors, like software engineering, that figure climbs to nearly 80%. Employees are quietly deploying AI to write reports, debug code, and streamline tedious tasks, but they\u2019re keeping it under wraps, fearful that transparency could lead to heavier workloads or job losses. After all, why are you getting paid if most of your job can be done with the help of AI?\n\nThis clandestine adoption hints at a peculiar paradox: AI may be more disruptive than we realize, but the disruption is happening quietly, in the shadows of office cubicles. This isn\u2019t the AI revolution the hype trains promised. It\u2019s a whisper, not a roar.\n\nFor businesses, this means AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Companies that foster openness and experimentation could harness AI\u2019s full potential, while those clinging to old management styles might miss the boat entirely.\n\nThe Year of Reckoning?\n\nSo, what happens next? 2025 looms large. It could be the year AI makes good on its promise, with breakthroughs in fields as diverse as drug discovery and military defense. Or it could be the year the bubble finally bursts under the weight of unmet expectations.\n\nHistory offers no certainties, but it does offer patterns. The dot-com bubble wasn\u2019t just a story of irrational exuberance; it was also a story of real innovation that eventually found its footing. The internet did transform the world \u2014 just not in the exponential, uninterrupted path investors had hoped for. Perhaps AI is in for a similar treatment: a cataclysmic stock market crash that would hamper progress for a few years while at the same time sanitizing the industry by removing inefficient companies; then, only after a recovery, perhaps will AI make good on its many promises. Just like Pets.com was ahead of its time, so too maybe is the current AI hype train.\n\nThe hype may fade. Stocks may tumble. But beneath the surface, the technology could continue to mature, slowly and steadily finding its place in our lives. As the frenzy quiets down, we may discover that the most profound changes often happen in the spaces between bubbles \u2014 not with a pop, but with a quiet breath of reality."
