        "article_content": "Area 51 is the most famous alien base shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories\n\nAn infamous part of America has been \"revealed\" to be the home of another alien base. A lawyer, Danny Sheehan has worked to bring UFO whistleblowers to the United States Congress over recent years. Alien base conspiracy theories have cropped up time and time again but Mr Sheehan has helped to give evidence of alleged government cover-ups involving extraterrestrial beings. There have been some serious allegations made including that at the locations of two bases, hundreds of UFOs have been seen going \u201cin and out of it\u201d. Mr Sheehan spoke on Julian Dorey\u2019s podcast about the potential location of alien bases in the US.\n\nThe Arizona mountains are allegedly home to a secret alien base\n\nHe said one base is under the sea bed off the island of Isla Guadalupe and another is hidden away on land. Mr Sheehan added: \u201cThere's another base outside of Sedona, Arizona, over by a place called 'secret mount' wilderness \u2013 a totally desolate area. \u201cThere's a base there where the craft are, there's a number of them high in the mountains in remote areas of the planet and they're here now and they're extraordinarily distressed about the state of affairs (of humanity).\u201d In terms of what lies inside, Mr Sheehan claimed aliens were \u201cmantis people\u201d who could have advanced weaponry. When asked what the \u201cmantis people\u201d are, he said: \u201cThey are huge, seven feet tall, extraordinarily skinny, thin, kind of bowed over and remind people of a praying mantis... they are also called 'insectoids'. Whenever they're seen with tall greys, they seem to be in charge... giving telepathic commands.\u201d\n\nMany conspiracy theorists are keen to share their thoughts on UFO and alien sightings\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Luckily, if first contact with alien life turns out just like in \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d a new survey has some tips on where to hide! In an out-of-this-world analysis that comes on the heels of safety officials releasing the first-ever police handbook on UFOs, researchers with the website Rant Casino have put out a list of which U.S. states would fare best during an extraterrestrial invasion. The timing couldn\u2019t be more relevant \u2014 searches for \u201cwhat would happen if aliens came to Earth\u201d have skyrocketed by an astounding 2,850% in recent months, while nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe in the existence of alien life. Even more striking, 34% of Americans now consider UFOs as proof of alien life, up significantly from 20% in 1996.\n\nShould E.T. invade in the near future, fleeing to Virginia emerged as Americans\u2019 best hope for survival, scoring an impressive 8.03 out of 10 on the alien survival index. The state\u2019s robust military presence \u2014 the highest per capita force in the nation \u2014 combined with its natural defenses of 29 caves and 63% forest cover make it an ideal stronghold against otherworldly threats. Close behind is Alabama, scoring 7.90 out of 10, with its network of 35 caves and the highest forest coverage (71%) among top-ranked states. The state\u2019s relatively low UFO sighting rate of 2.76 per 10,000 people suggests it might fly under alien radar, while its considerable law enforcement presence \u2014 267.35 per capita, nearly double that of Oregon\u2019s 145.01 \u2014 positions it well for coordinated defense efforts.\n\nMinnesota rounds out the top three with a score of 7.83, distinguished by its intellectual firepower of 5.07 scientists and 10.12 engineers per 1,000 residents. The state\u2019s impressive ratio of 32.01 healthcare professionals per capita and 882 food and beverage manufacturers strengthens its survival prospects. Interestingly, New York finished as the fifth-best state for surviving an alien invasion. That being said, it\u2019s probably still a good idea to avoid the Empire State Building when the UFOs arrive, just saying.\n\n10 U.S. states most likely to survive an alien invasion Virginia Alabama Minnesota Massachusetts New York Florida Wisconsin North Carolina Alaska Georgia\n\nOn the flip side, Nevada\u2019s position as the state least likely to survive (scoring just 5.31 out of 10) might raise eyebrows. Despite its association with Area 51, the state\u2019s lack of natural cover, minimal water resources, and high UFO sighting rate of 5.41 per 10,000 residents make it particularly vulnerable. Idaho follows as second-most vulnerable, with the nation\u2019s lowest per capita healthcare workforce (22.95) and concerning UFO activity (6.95 sightings per 10,000 people).\n\n10 U.S. states least likely to survive an alien invasion Nevada Idaho Arizona Nebraska Oregon Utah Oklahoma New Hampshire South Carolina Wyoming\n\n\u201cGone are the days when it was regarded as part fringe, part-science fiction, and part conspiracy theory. UFOs are now being treated as a defense and national security issue, discussed in the United States Congress, and attracting attention from the Head of NASA,\u201d says former U.K. Ministry of Defense UFO investigator Nick Pope. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell whether we\u2019re seeing a genuine spike in UFO sightings \u2013 and if so, what this means \u2013 or whether what\u2019s happening is that a higher proportion of sightings is being reported, as a result of the current mainstream media coverage of this subject,\u201d Pope continues.\n\nThe study\u2019s methodology considered multiple survival factors, including UFO sighting frequencies, natural hiding spots like forests and caves, military and law enforcement presence, healthcare and scientific workforce, and food manufacturing capabilities. This comprehensive approach provides a sobering look at each state\u2019s preparedness for what once seemed like science fiction but increasingly captures public attention and government resources.\n\n\u201cThe subject has come out of the fringe and into the mainstream, which has led to lots more people speaking out about their own sightings and encounters. Regardless of the truth about these various incidents, it focuses on the fact that UFO sightings \u2013 whatever their cause \u2013 have serious and profound defense, national security, and air safety issues,\u201d Pope concludes."

        "article_content": "OSHKOSH (NBC 26) \u2014 The Oshkosh Paranormal Society is a group of lifelong ghost enthusiasts who want to use their passion to help people. They\u2019ve carried out dozens of ghost investigations in the Oshkosh area.\n\n\n\nThose in the Oshkosh Paranormal Society have had a lifelong passion for ghosts\n\nThe group measures electricity and energy to communicate with spirits.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to help people find peace of mind with death.\n\nIngrid Lemke says her first encounter with a spirit was early in her childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a preteen, I had seen a shadow figure, and it just really terrified me,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it was hovering over me.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, Lemke says she has had a sort of \u201csixth sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in my day, they thought you were insane, so I only told my friends,\u201d she says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until her adulthood that Lemke would find a large group of like-minded people and create what is now the Oshkosh Paranormal Society.\n\nLemke says it was validating finding others with a similar connection to ghosts and spirits.\n\n\u201cIt feels wonderful, it feels freeing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society started as a group of Lemke and her coworkers, but now is a large Facebook group.\n\nMany in the group also had paranormal experiences as children.\n\n\u201cI think I was about eight,\u201d Emily Kampmann, a member of the group, says. \u201cI kind of woke up on the floor one day in my bedroom, and I was staring at my closet\u2026. and the door was wide open and there was glowing lights, like eyeballs staring at me. I know it sounds silly.\u201d\n\nThe group gets together to do paranormal investigations in haunted areas around Oshkosh. They\u2019ve investigated the local cemetery, The Grand Oshkosh, the Algoma Club and multiple personal homes.\n\nLemke says the downtown area near the Algoma Club and the Grand Oshkosh seem to be particularly haunted, which she believes is due to Oshkosh\u2019s two 19th century fires.\n\n\u201cOur investigations are generally scientific,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe group relies on different types of instruments and tools to pick up on energy shifts in the air. Some of the tools are used by electricians to track electricity.\n\n\u201cSo the theory is that spirits are energy, so when they get close to that, it triggers it,\u201d Jason Tiffany, a member of the group, says.\n\nThey also use recording devices to pick up on voices they wouldn\u2019t normally hear.\n\nLemke says they find a lot of evidence after the investigation ends and they\u2019re able to rewatch the footage.\n\n\u201cIt takes many hours,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe Algoma Club in Oshkosh was a speakeasy during prohibition, and Lemke says they\u2019ve found lots of evidence of prohibition-era spirits roaming the space.\n\n\"It's definitely a heavy presence,\" Lilly Heft, another member of the group says of the Algoma Club. \"I feel spooky in here.\"\n\nDespite the many hours that go into each investigation, the group says they are always fun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s an adrenaline rush, but it kind of is,\u201d Heft says.\n\nHeft says she\u2019s a \u201chardcore believer\u201d in ghosts, but that\u2019s not true for everyone in the group.\n\n\u201cIf you hear a voice, you know, understanding that, is that your brain just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on?\" Stephanie Whittaker, another member of the group says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just, well for me anyways, you can\u2019t just let your imagination run away with you.\u201d\n\nWhittaker says she\u2019s a \u201cskeptic,\u201d and often questions the evidence the group collects. Still, there are some findings that she says are hard to deny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve, with the group, had enough experiences that I can\u2019t explain,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than the thrill of finding ghosts, the Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to use its passion to help people.\n\n\u201cMy favorite aspect of our group is when we help people in their personal houses,\u201d Lemke says. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve felt like I did when I was a kid\u2014 who do I reach out to? Who do I trust with this? I know how that feels not having any validation.\u201d\n\nLemke says she\u2019s helped expel angry spirits from homes, as well as give people the confirmation that they\u2019re not imagining things.\n\nFor Kampmann, she thinks the group can help on a deeper level\u2014 giving comfort around death.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really neat to experiment with that and show people that there is life after death in some form, to not be like somewhat scared of death even,\u201d she says.\n\nMore information on the group can be found on their Facebook page.\n\n"

        "article_content": "SALEM, Ohio \u2014 In between the cracks of Gothic buildings and rusty swing carousels lies a dark past, one that the West Virginia Department of Tourism\u2019s Paranormal Trail seeks to uncover.\n\nLaunched on Oct. 1, the Paranormal Trail is a digital passport that rewards individuals for visiting West Virginia\u2019s reportedly most haunted locations through a tier system of prizes. In its first two weeks alone, the trail saw over 5,000 sign-ups.\n\nOn a larger scale, the trail takes visitors on a tour of the state, exposing its rich history and that not everything is as it seems.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to experience something different at everyone you go to,\u201d said Michelle Graham, filming and events manager for Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. \u201cYou can learn so much about things that are unexplained by the people who spend so much time in these buildings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee\n\nBeneath the soil of Lake Shawnee abandoned amusement park lies thousands of years of history. It starts with the Native American Shawnee tribe which occupied West Virginia for nearly 2,000 years before the United States government told them to assimilate or leave in 1831.\n\nOne of the most notable Shawnee leaders was Chief Cornstalk, originally named Hokleskwa, which translates loosely to \u201cstalk of corn.\u201d He was the leader of the Shawnee nation between 1720-1777.\n\nCornstalk was murdered by American militiamen while on a diplomatic visit in November 1777, during the American Revolutionary War. His death furthered tensions between the two groups.\n\nAround the same time, the first English settlers in Mercer County, the Clay family, moved to what is now known as the Lake Shawnee property in 1775. Mitchell and Phoebe Clay had 16 children, but three of them would be massacred by the Shawnee tribe in 1783.\n\nViolent deaths continued to plague the property after Conley T. Snidow turned it into an amusement park, which opened in 1926. Six children were killed in accidents at Lake Shawnee Amusement Park between 1926 and 1967, when the park finally closed.\n\nThe park was reopened by former employee Gaylord White in 1987 but would only operate as an amusement park for two years before closing again.\n\nAt a crossroads with what to do, Gaylord and his son, Chris White, the current owner of Lake Shawnee, decided to turn the property into a mud bog in 1989 \u2014 but they would uncover something much more valuable than dirt.\n\nWhile bulldozing the empty field in 1990, they started finding arrowheads and pieces of pottery. Gaylord immediately stopped and called Marshall University archaeologists to inspect the land. The team would uncover loads of Native American artifacts between 1990-1991, as well as a Shawnee burial ground.\n\nToday, the site pays homage to the Shawnee tribe where artifacts are on display. Additionally, Chris White provides a brief history on the Shawnee tribe. Someday, he hopes to create a small Native American museum on-site.\n\nThe abandoned amusement park also honors the other deaths that occurred on site, including the Clay family and the children who died while the amusement park was in operation.\n\nOver the years, visitors have left offerings to the Native Americans or the children like handcrafted items, stuffed animals, pinwheels and various toys.\n\n\u201cWe ask anybody that comes to bring an offering, and the offering doesn\u2019t need to be valuable,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cIt\u2019s better if it means something to you.\u201d\n\n1 of 19\n\nNumerous TV shows and paranormal investigators have also visited the site to film and experience the ghosts of the park\u2019s past. Many claim the spirits of the children who died at the park remain there today.\n\nSince taking part in the Paranormal Trail, Chris White has seen an increase in visitors at Lake Shawnee. He hopes more people continue visiting Lake Shawnee and the other sites on the Paranormal trail.\n\n\u201cVistors should come to Lake Shawnee because it\u2019s unique,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cYou will learn a lot about Native American history and their culture, the way they lived and the way they died. You can walk the creepy trail (where the Clay children died) and you can go around the park and take photos of the Ferris Wheel and swings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee, 470 Matoaka Road, Rock, West Virginia, offers daytime tours and overnight stays by appointment only. For more information, call or text 304-921-1580, or visit www.wvlakeshawnee.com.\n\nTrans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum\n\nLurking in the halls of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum are decades\u2019 worth of memories that are both tragic and pleasant in equal measure.\n\n\u201cWe ran the entire gamut of mental health treatment progression in the years that the asylum was in operation,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere was a lot of dark history there, but at the same time we want to highlight and showcase that this was somebody\u2019s home. There were people who cried when the asylum closed in 1994 because they\u2019d spent their entire lives here. We have just as much good as we have bad.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum began in 1858. The facility opened in 1864, although work on it would continue until 1881. It is the largest hand-cut stone masonry building in North America and is the second largest in the world, next to the Kremlin. The asylum was originally designed to provide care for 250 patients.\n\nIn the beginning, there weren\u2019t strong criteria for admitting patients, Graham said. However, over time, the asylum would start separating the patients based on needs within the wards of the asylum including violent females, violent males, tuberculosis and more.\n\nThe oldest section of the building is the Civil War section, which housed both Union and Confederate soldiers during the early days of operations.\n\nAt its peak in the 1950s, the asylum housed 2,400 patients. Treatments ranged from lobotomies, electroshock therapy and hydrotherapy in the early years to various forms of discussion-based therapy and antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs in the later years.\n\nEventually, with the evolution of modern-day healthcare, outpatient care became more common which is one of the contributing factors for the asylums closure in 1994. The asylum reopened as a tourist attraction in March 2008.\n\nToday, the asylum acts not only as one of the most unique pieces of architecture in the world but seeks to highlight the evolution of mental health care. Graham adds that the treatments of lobotomies and electroshock therapy given prior to the 1960s are often misinterpreted as acts of vengeance.\n\n\u201cThis was not just some horror place that that they were experimenting on patients,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThey 100% believed that it was the best medical practice that was going to help the patients that resided at the asylum at the time.\u201d\n\nThe Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, 50 S River Ave., Weston, West Virginia, is part of West Virginia\u2019s Paranormal Trail and has many tours available, including the history tour, discover the asylum tour, photography tours, ghost tours and more. Reservations are required for some of the tours. For more information, visit trans-alleghenylunaticasylum.com.\n\nParanormal Trail\n\nThe trail includes 18 haunted stops across West Virginia. To join the journey, interested parties need to register to receive a link that opens up a personal digital passport.\n\nVisitors will click the check-in button, upon visiting a location, which earns them prizes the more locations they visit. At three locations, participants get a Paranormal Trail sticker, at 10 they get a Paranormal Trail beanie and by visiting all 18 they get a limited edition Paranormal Trail print designed by West Virginia artist Liz Pavlovic.\n\nThe challenge lasts until the end of the year. However, if it proves to be popular, the West Virginia Department of Tourism may extend it to next year.\n\nSites on the Paranormal Trail include:\n\nMothman Museum; Point Pleasant, West Virginia; www.mothmanmuseum.com\n\nWest Virginia Penitentiary; Moundsville, West Virginia; wvpentours.com\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel; Parkersburg, West Virginia; theblennerhassett.com\n\nGhost Tour of Harpers Ferry; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; www.harpersferryghost.20m.com\n\nHotel Morgan; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.hotelmorgan.com\n\nFlatwoods Monster Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; braxtonwv.org/the-flatwoods-monster/visit-the-museum\n\nThe Old Hospital on College Hill; Williamson, West Virginia; www.collegehillhospital.com\n\nThe Historic Glen Ferris Inn; Glen Ferris, West Virginia; www.glenferrisinn.com/home-9866\n\nShepherdstown Mystery Walk; Shepherdstown, West Virginia; shepherdstownmysterywalks.com\n\nThe Haunted Haymond; Sutton, West Virginia; www.facebook.com/thehaymondhousehaunted\n\nFlinderation Tunnel, Salem, West Virginia\n\nBigfoot Statue (Elk River Trail); Ivydale, West Virginia; www.elkrivertrail.org/rail-trailheads/06\n\nWest Virginia Bigfoot Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; wvbigfootmuseum.org\n\nSilver Run Tunnel (North Bend Rail Trail); Cairo, West Virginia; wvstateparks.com/park/north-bend-rail-trail\n\nCryptid Mountain Miniature Golf; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.cryptidmountainminigolf.com\n\nHempfield Tunnel (Wheeling Heritage Trail); Wheeling, West Virginia; www.wheelingwv.gov/directory/Parks-Recreation/heritage-trail\n\nFor more information, visit wvtourism.com/west-virginia-paranormal-trail.\n\n(Liz Partsch can be reached at epartsch@farmanddairy.com or 330-337-3419.)"

        "article_content": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. \u2014 Is your workplace haunted? Inspired by ghostly rumors at KOLR 10, the Frightly News team has decided to investigate paranormal activity right in their own building.\n\nHistory of KOLR 10\n\nIn July 1952, the Independent Broadcasting Company, which owned radio station KTTS, applied to the FCC to build a station in Springfield. Once the application was approved, KTTS signed affiliation agreements with CBS and the DuMont Television Network in 1953, according to the Springfield Leader and Press.\n\nKTTS began broadcasting on channel 10 on March 15, 1953. It was the first television station in Springfield and the third in Missouri after WDAF-TV in Kansas City and KSD-TV in St. Louis. Six years later, the new tower and building on Division Street was constructed and staff moved to the location.\n\nIn 1971, Independent Broadcasting agreed to sell the KTTS radio stations. They retained channel 10, which was renamed KOLR, to promote color television. The television station was renamed to KOLR 10 on November 29, 1971.\n\nIs the KOLR 10 building haunted?\n\nStrangely, in the past six years, more employees have come out to discuss the rumors of a ghost residing in the hallways of KOLR 10. After speaking with employees who have worked here the longest, none of them have any stories about any paranormal activity, however, a good portion of the members of the production, the news, and the lifestyle departments have seen or heard something.\n\nA large difference between the employees who have experienced things and those who haven\u2019t is their work shift. A news station is running 24/7. There is a small window where employees are alone in their department or the building, but it happens every day. Most of the employees who claim paranormal activity also happen to work overnight/early morning shifts or weekends.\n\nA typical workday is filled with reporters and producers running around, engineers fixing the latest problems, salespeople meeting with clients, and local acts performing for the camera. There are police scanners screeching and televisions in every room.\n\nFrightly News asked the Southwest Ghost Finders (SWGF) to visit the station and do a ghost investigation.\n\nThere are similar reports of hearing phantom conversations happening in or around the sports and lifestyle departments\u2014which share the newest section of the building. SWGF was able to deduce the sounds came from some machinery near the building\u2019s elevator. The sound resonates throughout hallways making it seem like a conversation is happening in a different spot than it really is. However, one investigator said she heard and felt someone breathing on her when she passed through the sports department. (I also have a similar story, except it was inside the newsroom)\n\nThere have been reports of seeing shadow people and even a full-body apparition. Reporters and producers who work during the early morning shifts or the weekend shifts have said that they would see and feel the presence of someone around them.\n\nA former director told Frightly News she saw a little girl standing by the elevator one morning. When she went to investigate who the child was and why they were hanging out by the offices, no one was found. However, the door to the office was always closed, according to the director, that morning the door was open.\n\nThe former lifestyle show, Ozarks Fox AM, also had an infamous episode where a pastry fell off of a table at the mention of an Ouija board.\n\nYou can find that video here:\n\nOne SWGF tool, a cat toy that lights up when it is shaken, went off in the lifestyle offices for minutes with no explanation of why. The same thing happened inside the newsroom.\n\nAfter conducting a dowsing rod session, where metal rods are used to cross, separate, or point to yes or no questions, SWGF investigators said they believed they spoke to a little girl and a man.\n\nInvestigators said most theaters are haunted, there\u2019s a lot of energy from people who come and go and a lot of emotions. The same could be said for a television station. Just like there is a ghost light for the stage, the lights never go out at the station either.\n\nYou can find the investigation video above.\n\nCheck out these other Frightly News Investigations:\n\nA tour of HGTV\u2019s Scariest House in America\n\nGhosts at DeLong Plumbing?

        "article_content": "Thousands of computers across the world are currently scouring the number line in a scavenger hunt for rare mathematical gems. Prime number enthusiasts, looking for larger and larger numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves, muster vast amounts of computing power and algorithmic ingenuity in hopes of etching their name into the scrolls of math history.\n\nThe latest entry comes from Luke Durant, a researcher in San Jose, Calif. Durant\u2019s discovery overturned the former record holder, which sat uncontested for nearly six years, an unprecedentedly long reign in the modern search for ever larger prime numbers. The gap makes sense: as primes grow, they spread further apart, making each new find harder than the last.\n\nThe new prime contains a mind-boggling 41,024,320 digits. To put that in perspective, the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe clocks in at around 80 digits. Every additional digit increases a number by 10 times, so the size of the new prime lives far beyond human intelligibility. Primes play a major role in pure math, where they\u2019re main characters in a field called number theory, and in practice, where, for example, they underlie widely used encryption algorithms. A prime with 41 million digits won\u2019t immediately join the ranks of useful numbers, but for now, it adds a feather in the cap of a community that longs to apprehend the colossal.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nDurant\u2019s success stems in part from new clever software from the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and in part from heavy-duty hardware and computational muscle that he personally mobilized for the pursuit. By assembling a \u201ccloud supercomputer\u201d spanning 17 countries, he ended a long tradition of personal computers discovering primes.\n\nPrime numbers are often called the \u201cbuilding blocks of math\u201d because every whole number greater than 1 has a fingerprint as the product of a unique collection of primes. For example, 15 is the product of the primes 5 and 3, whereas 13 cannot be subdivided like this because 13 is prime. The study of these numbers dates back at least to the ancient Greeks. In 300 B.C.E. Euclid proved in his textbook Elements that infinitely many primes exist, and mathematicians, both professional and amateur, have relished the hunt for them ever since.\n\nWhile the first string of primes\u20142, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on\u2014is easy to find, the task gets considerably more challenging as the numbers get larger. For millennia, people found primes by hand\u2014until 1951, when computers took over the search. But even silicon bounty hunters struggle to spot primes in the far reaches of the number line because testing the primality of an enormous number is nontrivial. To cope, researchers deploy every little optimization trick they can to speed up their tests or narrow their hunting ground, thereby boosting their chances of finding a new prime.\n\nConsider the number 99,400,891. How would you determine whether or not it\u2019s prime? You could simply divide it by every smaller number and check if it has any divisors (in addition to 1 and itself). But that\u2019s nearly 100 million cases to check for a relatively puny eight-digit number. You would save significant work by realizing that you don\u2019t need to check every number up to the target, just the prime numbers. Why? You only need to find one divisor (one number that cleanly divides 99,400,891 with no remainder). We know that any nonprime divisor could be further broken down into its prime factors\u2014if your target is divisible by 15, then it\u2019s also divisible by the primes 5 and 3, so you only need to check the latter to determine primality. Further savings would come from the insight that you don\u2019t need to check every smaller prime either, only those up to the square root of 99,400,891 (the number that when multiplied by itself gives you this eight-digit result). If none of those smaller primes divide it cleanly, then you can stop looking because the product of any two numbers larger than the square root of 99,400,891 will exceed it. These efficiency tricks slash our search drastically, from around 100 million numbers to only 1,228 (the number of primes less than the square root of 99,400,891). For those curious, 99,400,891 = 9,967 \u00d7 9,973, so it\u2019s not prime.\n\nThose shortcuts did wonders for an eight-digit number, but how did Durant reach 41,024,320 digits? To graduate the search from the merely massive to the truly gargantuan, he and many other seekers focus on particular types of prime numbers. Mersenne primes, named for Marin Mersenne, the French theologian who studied them in the 17th century, take a special form. You get them by multiplying 2 by itself some number of times and then subtracting 1, as described in the equation 2n \u2013 1. Mersenne noticed that when you plug in different values for n, you sometimes get a prime number. Specifically, 2n \u2013 1 can only yield a prime when n itself is prime, and even then it\u2019s not guaranteed. What makes Mersenne primes special from a prime hunter\u2019s perspective is that we know a fast method (called the Lucas-Lehmer primality test) for checking whether numbers of the form 2n \u2013 1 are prime. That test is much faster than any known general methods for numbers without that special form.\n\nThe Lucas-Lehmer test fuels the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project, which launched in 1996 and enables any volunteer to download a free code that searches for Mersenne primes to run on their computers. The crowdsourced approach and the focus on Mersenne primes have proved successful. The seven largest known primes are all Mersenne primes and were all found by participants of the project. Note that smaller unknown primes certainly exist, but because we don\u2019t know efficient methods for checking them, they\u2019ll remain in the shadows for now.\n\nAll told, project volunteers have found 18 new Mersenne primes, 17 of which owe their discovery to the personal computers of hobbyists. Durant, a 36-year-old former Nvidia engineer, just broke that streak. Nvidia, which recently briefly overtook Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, designs specialty computer chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). As the name suggests, GPUs were originally invented to accelerate the rendering of graphics, but they also excel at other tasks involving highly parallelized computation, in which many processors run simultaneously to solve problems. Those problems include training neural networks such as GPT-4, mining cryptocurrency and, as it turns out, foraging for primes. Durant assembled a global supercomputer by buying processing time from various cloud GPU providers. At its peak, Durant\u2019s project churned through about 12 times as many numbers as every other computer involved in the Mersenne prime search combined.\n\nIn addition to the heavy-duty hardware, the Mersenne prime search software also got a notable upgrade since the last discovery. It replaced the superfast Lucas-Lehmer test for certifying Mersenne primes with a super-duper-fast probable prime test. Given a number to check, the latter test either confirms that it\u2019s not prime or says that it\u2019s probably prime. Probable primes have a very small chance of turning out to be nonprime. Only once a computer finds a probable prime do Mersenne prime search volunteers run the full-fledged Lucas-Lehmer test to remove any doubt. Durant\u2019s new prime passed the probable prime test on October 11. Then, on October 19, a year after Durant started searching, independent tests by the Mersenne prime search confirmed that he had indeed found a needle in a haystack: 2136,279,841 \u2013 1 is the largest known prime number.\n\nIt exceeds the previous record holder by more than 16 million digits. If that didn\u2019t earn enough glory, Durant has also unearthed the largest known \u201cperfect number.\u201d A perfect number equals the sum of its divisors (excluding itself); 6 is perfect because it\u2019s divisible by 1, 2, 3 and equals the sum of 1 + 2 + 3. The second perfect number is 28. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler proved that every even perfect number can be generated from a Mersenne prime, so finding one promises a two-for-one deal on math discoveries.\n\nThe well could dry up any time, though. We don\u2019t know whether an infinite number of Mersenne primes (and therefore even perfect numbers) exist. Curiously, we don\u2019t know whether any odd perfect numbers exist, a question that some call the oldest unsolved math problem.\n\nWhen asked how much money his project cost in an interview with Numberphile on YouTube, Durant said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s under $2 million.\u201d That\u2019s a hefty investment compared with the prime search project prize money of $3,000, which he plans to donate to the high school he attended, the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science. At this point, you might wonder why so many people spend their time and money trolling for primes that don\u2019t have obvious real-world applications. In part, their efforts celebrate human curiosity and serve as a benchmark for our progress in mathematical computation. But I think the founder of the Mersenne prime search project, George Woltman, when asked this question in a Numberphile video, said it best: \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d"

        "article_content": "With a more than $7 million grant from the Department of Energy, a multi-institution team including members from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will develop a generative AI assistant called Theseus to help researchers in a variety of fields.\n\nIn ancient Greek mythology, the hero Theseus is famous for cleverly solving a labyrinth and defeating the Minotaur at its center. That story, as well as a famous maze experiment from the history of machine learning, is the inspiration for a new generative AI tool that helps researchers navigate the domain of computer modeling.\n\nAs science, engineering, and other fields rely more and more on powerful computers to generate digital versions of molecules, machines, and other complex systems, researchers must devote significant time and resources to produce these simulations. With a more than $7 million grant from the Department of Energy, the Theseus research team aims to change that.\n\n\u201cThe AI tool we are developing is meant to reduce the time and labor that go into computational modeling, thus accelerating the pace of research and discovery. We envision an AI assistant that acts as a collaborator, suggesting and running simulations, and helping researchers accomplish what could normally take a year in a matter of weeks,\u201d said Shaowu Pan, Ph.D., co-principal investigator on the grant and an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nThe three-year grant is led by Patrick Emami, Ph.D., of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and includes co-principal investigators Sameera Horawalavithana, Ph.D., of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Jason Eisner, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWith his expertise in computational science, Pan will focus on testing and refining the applications of an advanced generative AI assistant in computational science.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI tools such as ChatGPT have laid the groundwork for this kind of specialized tool,\u201d Pan explained. \u201cLet\u2019s say someone is designing a new kind of wind turbine that will generate more clean energy. To do this, the researcher needs to simulate their design on a computer. The Theseus assistant adds another layer of scientific intuition to that process, not only checking the code for bugs, but also making suggestions about possible hypotheses and pointing the user to relevant existing research. Ultimately, we want our AI model to enhance the work of computational scientists.\u201d\n\nTrained on a large body of studies, existing computer models, figures, images, and more, the tool could have broad implications for many disciplines, not just fluid dynamics and computational science, Pan said.\n\n\u201cThe transition from the slide rule to the calculator, and, more recently, the adoption of computer-assisted design, are two examples of technological advances that increased research productivity. We hope our generative AI assistants represent the next such leap and start a wave of revolution for the next decade,\u201d Pan said."

He\u2019ll be matched against Will Anderson Jr., one of the league\u2019s most exciting pass-rushers, totaling 7.5 this season.\n\nI like his chances to notch another sack on Thursday (-110 on Fanatics). Anderson\u2018s athleticism and the Texans\u2019 aggressive pass rush should put pressure on Rodgers and create opportunities for the star defensive end to make a big play."

        "article_content": "For more than a century, Antwerp has been a crucial hub for a $100 billion global industry\u2014one that virtually defines love and commitment, and one that has fueled vicious wars and terrible exploitation. The Belgian city is the world\u2019s biggest trading post for rough diamonds: About 40% of the world\u2019s annual supply of the gems pass through Antwerp\u2019s Diamantkwartier on their circuitous journey from mine to jewelry store.\n\nThe diamond district, three narrow streets near the train station, doesn\u2019t exactly reflect the glamour and glitter of the finished product. But the quarter\u2019s modest buildings bely a high-flying business inside. Upstairs in one diamond-trading building on a recent September afternoon, an engineer sat gazing at a golf-ball-size rock on his desk.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I have seen a diamond this big, and I have worked 17 years in the industry,\u201d said the engineer, Narshi Kalsariya, studying a 3D image of its intricate facets on his monitor. Dug out of the ground more than 7,000 miles away, in the southern African country of Botswana, the rock weighs more than 1,000 carats, or about seven ounces.\n\nThe size alone is notable: Only about 10 gem-quality diamonds that big have ever been found since humans began digging for them more than 2,000 years ago.\n\nBut just as notable is the company that currently controls this rare find. It\u2019s not De Beers, the London-based industry powerhouse that mines and trades nearly one-third of the world\u2019s diamonds (most of them from Botswana). Instead it\u2019s a tiny startup called HB Antwerp, which was launched just four years ago by three Belgian-Israeli cofounders, Rafael Papismedov, Shai de Toledo, and Oded Mansori.\n\nPapismedov and de Toledo, who met while dropping off their kids at their Belgian school, launched the company with what seemed like a preposterous goal: to upend the 130-year-old business model for diamond trading. The industry has long been an insular one whose skills and opaque trading networks are passed down through generations from fathers to sons, like family secrets.\n\nThe two friends wanted to shift control and profits away from hubs like London, Antwerp, and Tel Aviv to the countries where the diamonds are actually found. They argue that Botswana, with just 2.6 million people and vast diamond reserves (and tourist-attracting elephants) has not gotten its fair share since Western companies began extracting its precious gems nearly 60 years ago.\n\nBy many measures, Botswana has benefited hugely. It was one of the world\u2019s poorest countries when diamonds were discovered in the late 1960s, but the World Bank now classifies Botswana as an upper-middle-income country. Yet it still suffers from high unemployment and deep inequality, thanks to its overwhelming dependence on its global trade in diamonds\u2014a natural resource that will someday run dry.\n\nWhile HB\u2019s model does little to lessen that reliance on a single industry, Botswanan politicians have eyed it as a way to boost job creation and create homegrown manufacturing\u2014and keep more of the profits from the industry in-country. Botswana\u2019s market share in diamonds has surged this year, as the U.S. and Europe began blocking diamonds from Russia, the world\u2019s biggest producer; that growth is giving the model a crucial test run.\n\nThese circumstances put HB Antwerp at the heart of a roiling debate over whether Western companies are fleecing resource-rich African countries\u2014including those with critical minerals like cobalt, which are essential for semiconductors\u2014and whether those companies deepen the divide between rich and poor regions. Those issues have come into sharper focus since the COVID pandemic wreaked havoc on supply chains, and as younger consumers increasingly seek products that reflect their social values.\n\nTo many critics, diamonds epitomize this controversy. And HB Antwerp\u2019s founders count themselves among the detractors.\n\n\u201cEverything is wrong with this industry,\u201d says Papismedov, sitting in its headquarters atop Antwerp\u2019s old diamond exchange building. For decades, he says, mining companies have hauled out as many rough diamonds as possible, as fast as possible, in order to recoup capital expenses, and then auctioned them in bulk to diamond dealers, who have them polished and cut into jewels.\n\nA diamond-cutting laser at HB Antwerp.\n\nThe African countries aren\u2019t the only ones who suffer from this relentless extraction: The diamond market is hurting too. \u201cThey are manufacturing things that nobody asked them to manufacture,\u201d Papismedov says. \u201cIt is a market for gamblers.\u201d After a post-pandemic spending boom, demand for diamonds has fallen steadily since 2022, as China\u2019s economy has slowed and inflation has risen. De Beers\u2019s revenues sank 21% in the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, and that downturn came after a steep drop in 2023.\n\nDiamond dealers are now pinning their hopes on Americans splurging this Christmas season. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping the American season will be positive,\u201d Isi Morsel, president of the Antwerp World Diamond Council, the leading trade organization, and CEO of Dali Diamond, tells Fortune. \u201cPrices are the lowest they\u2019ve been since before the pandemic. Nearly half the engagement rings sold in U.S. jewelry stores now are made not with natural diamonds\u2014rocks that are billions of years old, formed hundreds of miles under the Earth\u2014but lab-grown, synthetic diamonds, which cost about one-tenth the price of the real thing.\"\n\nTo attack these problems, Papismedov and de Toledo wanted to flip the industry\u2019s trading model on its head. Rather than paying the Botswana government for parcels of rough diamonds, it offered a cut of the final market price of polished gems, giving the country a far bigger portion of the total revenues. \"It\u2019s super-simple,\u201d Papismedov says, outlining HB\u2019s pitch to Botswana\u2019s government: \u201cWe take 20% off the top. The higher I can sell it, the higher my margin. The other 80% is yours.\u201d Then HB Antwerp tapped Microsoft engineers to build a blockchain infrastructure that could make their plan work, by tracking the provenance of the finished gems\u2014and the revenue they generated\u2014with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nHB Antwerp\u2019s revenues last year were about $181 million and its projected revenues this year are $200 million. That is still minuscule compared with De Beers, which effectively invented the global diamond market\u2014along with the slogan \u201cDiamonds are forever,\u201d dreamed up by a De Beers copywriter in the late 1940s. What is more, by sourcing all its diamonds from a single small Botswana mine that specializes in detecting huge stones, HB Antwerp now possesses some of the biggest diamonds ever found.\n\nBut HB\u2019s impact far outweighs its balance sheet. The startup has already helped Botswana significantly increase its revenue from diamonds. And it has already pressured the industry behemoth to alter its own business terms. Now some fans of HB Antwerp believe its approach could revolutionize other mining industries that have a far greater impact on the global economy.\n\nTaking on diamond giant De Beers\n\nIn the diamond-trading hall downstairs from HB\u2019s offices, the mugshots of bad creditors and swindlers are displayed on a peg board. The perpetrators have all been convicted in special diamond courts in Antwerp, and their presence on this board effectively ices them out of the industry.\n\nThe mugshot board is a veritable symbol of the community\u2019s insularity\u2014and HB Antwerp\u2019s founders say that they felt a similarly cold shoulder from the old-timers in Antwerp, who saw the startup\u2019s approach as a harebrained idea cooked up by outsiders with little understanding of the business. \u201cWhen we began, they laughed at us,\u201d Papismedov says. \u201cThey met us in the elevator, and told us we would be bankrupt in two days.\u201d\n\nNo one is laughing now. The startup has ignited fierce discussion among diamond producers and dealers, and even complicated De Beers\u2019s decades-long joint venture with Botswana, whose government now glimpses the possibility of more generous profit-sharing. \u201cIt's a small drop in the ocean,\u201d de Toledo says. \u201cBut once you understand what is coming out from every stone, you start to doubt everything else.\u201d\n\nLast year, as Botswana negotiated a new contract with De Beers, President Mokgweetsi Masisi insisted on a bigger share of profits, saying, \u201cWe must not be enslaved.\u201d (Masisi faced a tough battle for a second five-year term in national elections held on Wednesday; the voting tally was still underway at the time of publication. Opposition politicians say the government has failed to alleviate poverty or Botswana\u2019s 28% unemployment rate\u2014problems that have worsened with the global diamond trade\u2019s slump.)\n\nDe Beers, which sources about 73% of its diamonds from Botswana, eventually agreed to double the government\u2019s share of its output (and hence revenues) of rough diamonds over the next decade, to 50% from 25%. De Beers chief people officer Malebogo Mpugwa told Fortune the company is also investing in programs to diversify Botswana\u2019s economy; 80% of the country\u2019s foreign earnings come from its diamond exports. \u201cEven though diamonds are forever, diamond mines are not,\u201d she says.\n\nNeither, perhaps, is De Beers\u2019s clout. Earlier this year, the company was put up for sale by its owner, the London-based mining giant Anglo American. But with no reported offers so far, some analysts express doubts about its future. \u201cIs De Beers\u2019 empire on the rocks?\u201d the specialist newsletter Africa Intelligence asked in late September\u2014a question that would have seemed unthinkable until recently. \u201cHB Antwerp is a real challenge to De Beers\u2019 dominance, undermining it at the most inopportune moment,\u201d the publication wrote. (De Beers strategic communications chief David Johnson dismissed the dire prediction, telling Fortune, \u201cWe see a lot of opportunity.\u201d)\n\nThe question is, how widely adaptable is HB Antwerp\u2019s model? A Microsoft spokesperson said in an email that the startup is being seen as a blueprint for using Microsoft\u2019s Azure SQL blockchain tech in sectors like financial services and health care. So, too, could it be a model for trading in commodities like gold or platinum, in which global companies, not the countries of origin, make large profits from the final products.\n\nIt is hard to predict when that future will arrive. But Papismedov and de Toledo have already proved a point: A new idea, if brazen enough, can challenge the entrenched practices of even huge multinationals. \u201cThe step they took is really small, but nobody ever took it,\u201d says Stuart Krusell, senior director of global programs at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Business, whose students traveled to Botswana last year to research HB Antwerp\u2019s operations, on a trip partially funded by HB.\n\nKrusell believes industry players like De Beers grew complacent from decades of industry domination\u2014leaving them deeply vulnerable to disruption, especially the boom of lab-grown diamonds, even as inflation and the Ukraine war have shaken the market. He compares De Beers to \u201cGeneral Motors in the late \u201960s,\u201d when the biggest U.S. automaker missed the looming threat from newcomers like Toyota. \u201cYou\u2019re a monopoly and you have contracts you thought would never change,\u201d he says. \u201cSo why do anything different?\u201d\n\nA \"family tree\" for every stone\n\nDe Toledo grew up watching his father, a diamond cleaver, toil in a closed business with aging traders. He says that when HB Antwerp\u2019s team launched the company in January 2020, their mantra was: \u201cThis is a new supply chain. Forget everything that was done until now. Let\u2019s build a new one.\u201d\n\nTheir goal was to eliminate almost all the industry\u2019s middlemen, who typically stretch from Africa to Israel, India, and Europe, and to replace them with a stripped-down process, from mine to jewelry store. That includes training local diamond polishers and cutters in Botswana, rather than exporting bulk raw stones to India. HB opened a diamond factory in Botswana last year, with 45 locals trained in Antwerp working in well-paying skilled jobs. The idea is to eventually shift many more operations to the country. \u201cOur only clients are the people where the diamonds are coming from,\u201d de Toledo says.\n\nThe supply chain is also vastly simplified since HB Antwerp so far buys all its diamonds from one mine, Karowe, owned by the Vancouver, Canada\u2013based company Lucara Diamond\u2014another startup. Under the terms of their deal, HB has first, exclusive rights to all diamonds bigger than 10.8 carats.\n\nThe results have stunned the diamond world. No fewer than seven of the 10 biggest diamonds ever found have been discovered in little Karowe\u2014a pinprick on the map\u2014and all but two of those were acquired by HB Antwerp. The huge finds have emerged thanks to a German high-scanning technology called XRT, which Lucara rolled out in Karowe. It detects diamonds deep underground, so they can be hauled to the surface intact\u2014a stark difference from other mines, where mounds of earth are gouged out, then sifted in search of diamonds. And in contrast to the volatile market for small diamonds, giant diamonds are so rare that each can fetch tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn August, Lucara\u2019s Karowe operation found the second-biggest diamond ever unearthed, nearly breaking a record that has stood since 1905 (pieces of that older rock, called the Cullinan Diamond, ended up in the British crown jewels); in September, Lucara turned up another giant stone. \u201cThese discoveries have sent shock waves through our industry,\u201d says Grant Mobley, a gemologist and editor at the Natural Diamond Council, a trade organization. \u201cIt is unbelievable. Nobody expected it.\u201d\n\nBut in order for HB Antwerp to pay Botswana 80% of the polished-gem price, diamonds need to be completely traceable, right up through their purchase by the consumer\u2014something that is now possible, thanks to the blockchain. (De Beers has a similar proprietary system, called TRACR, which the company rolled out at scale in 2022, two years after HB\u2019s launch. Company spokesman Johnson says it now tracks about two-thirds of its diamonds.)\n\nThe technology is crucial to every part of HB Antwerp\u2019s work. Up in their offices one day in September, four engineers and data scientists sat at a table tracking on a wall-size monitor every diamond being worked on by the company, in real time, in both Botswana and Belgium, detailing what each employee was doing. The ledger collects more than 3,000 data points, and is refreshed every 15 minutes, creating what de Toledo calls \u201can internal audit that constantly looks for loopholes.\u201d\n\nNo diamond can be touched without being connected to an \u201cHB capsule,\u201d a small box that sits on every desk in the building. The box tracks each stone\u2019s transfer from one person to another, and connects that transition to the network. As each stone is cut into ever-smaller diamonds, a flowchart displays the origins and connections\u2014a \u201cfamily tree, with parents and siblings,\u201d as de Toledo calls it.\n\nBeginning next year, HB plans to create \u201cbirth certificates\u201d for consumers, allowing them to buy a piece of diamond jewelry with a document showing precisely where and when the gem or gems were found, and how many siblings they have. Experts believe that kind of storytelling is especially important as the demand for diamonds slows. \u201cConsumers care more and more about where a stone comes from,\u201d Mobley says, adding that the tracing process further separates natural diamonds from the lab-made versions, which more and more resemble the real thing. \u201cOne is made in Earth billions of years ago, the other is made in a factory in two weeks in India or China,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you can tell a story about a diamond\u2019s origin, a person will fall in love with that stone.\u201d\n\nAn engineer at his desk at HB Antwerp\n\nHB\u2019s founders hope that is true. Already, they say, their blockchain offers investors rare, reliable information about the potential market for the diamonds, making it easier for the startup to raise capital. \u201cAt any given moment, they know what the value is of the stones, and that is associated to that debt,\u201d de Toledo says.\n\nThat could determine whether HB is able to replicate its business elsewhere\u2014for example, in nearby Democratic Republic of Congo, home to giant reserves of copper, tantalum, and other minerals, and where three-quarters of the world\u2019s cobalt is mined. That country\u2019s president, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, visited HB\u2019s operation in Botswana last year to study its model.\n\nDe Toledo sees that interest as a sign that the company might play a bigger role ahead. \u201cThe aim of HB is not to be in the diamond industry,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is to show the mining world how a supply chain should look.\u201d\n\nCLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the role of Oded Mansori. He is a cofounder of HB Antwerp, as well as managing partner.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
