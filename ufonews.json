Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they\u2019re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).\n\nBlink-182\u2019s Tom DeLonge Has a Theory on the New Jersey Drones: They\u2019re UFOs\n\nJo Vito\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular Posts\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox."

            "article_content": "No chipmaker has benefited more from the rapid rise in artificial intelligence (AI) spending than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential for any company looking to develop and train large language models and build generative AI applications.\n\nNvidia flew past the $1 trillion milestone in May 2023. It's more than tripled since that point, becoming one of just three companies with a market capitalization above $3 trillion. But Nvidia isn't the only company that's seen its market capitalization soar as AI spending booms. In fact, AI advancements are virtually inseparable from the success of nearly every company valued at over a trillion dollars. The newest member, which both complements and competes with Nvidia, is no different.\n\nThe newest artificial intelligence chip stock in the $1 trillion club is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The stock passed the milestone after a stellar fourth-quarter earnings report on Dec. 12. Here's how the company became a leading AI chipmaker worth 13 figures.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company making the next generation of AI chips\n\nBroadcom is a well-diversified business. It has an enterprise software segment, led by VMWare and Symantec. It also makes semiconductors for applications, including wireless phones, WiFi, and Bluetooth. But what's really driving the business are two specialized semiconductor applications: Its networking chips, and its AI accelerators.\n\nBroadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While hyperscalers are paying billions for Nvidia's GPUs, they need Broadcom's chips to get the most out of their processing power. Broadcom's Tomahawk and Jericho switches ensure that data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That means there's less redundancy and downtime in processing. And when you're trying to make the most out of billions of dollars' worth of chips, every second counts.\n\nThere's no company that's even close to Broadcom's technology when it comes to developing these chips. Moreover, there's nobody in charge of a hyperscale data center who's going to risk their job by switching to a competitor's offering, no matter how much money it could save the business. So, as data centers grow the number of expensive GPUs and other chips in their server racks, Broadcom's business has grown exponentially.\n\nEven more promising is its custom AI accelerator business. These are the next generation of AI chips.\n\nBroadcom works with several companies to develop purpose-built AI chips for their data centers. Its three biggest customers are Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. Management estimates that these three companies will present an addressable market of between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. Considering all three companies' potential gains from advancements in AI, the high end of that number seems more likely than the low end.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists at Scripps Research have recently devised MovieNet, a transformative artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of understanding moving images with the subtlety of the human brain.\n\nUnlike traditional AI models that excel at analyzing static images, MovieNet is designed to recognize and interpret complex, changing scenes over time.\n\nThe innovation, detailed in a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, holds significant promise for applications ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe brain doesn\u2019t just see still frames; it creates an ongoing visual narrative,\u201d said senior author Hollis Cline, the director of the Dorris Neuroscience Center at Scripps Research.\n\n\u201cStatic image recognition has come a long way, but the brain\u2019s capacity to process flowing scenes \u2013 like watching a movie \u2013 requires a much more sophisticated form of pattern recognition. By studying how neurons capture these sequences, we\u2019ve been able to apply similar principles to AI.\u201d\n\nDrawing inspiration from the brain\n\nCline and first author Masaki Hiramoto, a staff scientist at Scripps Research, based their work on how the brain processes real-world visual sequences. The research focused on tadpoles, whose optic tectum \u2013 the brain\u2019s visual processing region \u2013 efficiently detects and responds to moving stimuli.\n\nThese neurons assemble fragments of visual information into coherent sequences, mimicking how humans perceive flowing scenes in real life.\n\n\u201cTadpoles have a very good visual system, plus we know that they can detect and respond to moving stimuli efficiently,\u201d Hiramoto explained.\n\nThe researchers identified neurons in tadpoles\u2019 brains that detect features such as shifts in brightness and changes in object rotation. These neurons process visual data in 100 to 600-millisecond clips, combining light and shadow patterns to create a continuous narrative.\n\nCline and Hiramoto trained MovieNet to emulate this neurological process, encoding dynamic video clips as a series of recognizable cues.\n\nAI watching video clips\n\nTo evaluate MovieNet, the researchers presented the model with video clips of tadpoles swimming in various conditions.\n\nThe model achieved an accuracy of 82.3% in distinguishing normal swimming behaviors from abnormal ones \u2013 outperforming human observers by 18% and surpassing the performance of leading AI models like Google\u2019s GoogLeNet, which managed only 72% accuracy.\n\n\u201cThis is where we saw real potential,\u201d Cline noted, emphasizing the significance of MovieNet\u2019s ability to handle dynamic data.\n\nUnlike conventional AI models, MovieNet efficiently processes and compresses information, enabling it to deliver high accuracy with reduced data and computational demands.\n\nA greener approach to AI\n\nOne of MovieNet\u2019s standout features is its energy efficiency. Conventional AI models require immense computational resources, contributing to a significant environmental footprint. MovieNet, by contrast, reduces energy demands by simplifying data into essential sequences without sacrificing performance.\n\n\u201cBy mimicking the brain, we\u2019ve managed to make our AI far less demanding, paving the way for models that aren\u2019t just powerful but sustainable,\u201d Cline said.\n\nThis efficiency positions MovieNet as an eco-friendly alternative, paving the way for scaling AI in industries where high costs have been a barrier.\n\nTransformative potential in medicine\n\nMovieNet\u2019s ability to interpret subtle changes over time has profound implications for medicine. The model could assist in early detection of health conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and irregular heart rhythms.\n\nFor example, small motor changes associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 often imperceptible to the human eye \u2013 could be flagged by the AI, allowing clinicians to intervene earlier.\n\nIn drug discovery, MovieNet\u2019s dynamic analysis could lead to more precise screening techniques. Traditional methods rely on static snapshots, which can miss critical changes over time.\n\nBy tracking cellular responses to chemical exposure, MovieNet can provide deeper insights into how drugs interact with biological systems.\n\n\u201cCurrent methods miss critical changes because they can only analyze images captured at intervals,\u201d Hiramoto remarked. \u201cObserving cells over time means that MovieNet can track the subtlest changes during drug testing.\u201d\n\nA technological leap for AI\n\nMovieNet\u2019s innovation goes beyond accuracy; it bridges gaps in existing AI technology by enabling nuanced analysis of dynamic scenes.\n\nIts ability to identify and interpret real-time changes in visual data sets a new standard for AI, making it a vital tool for applications requiring continuous monitoring and precise recognition.\n\nFor example, in autonomous vehicles, the AI could enhance safety by detecting and responding to changes in road conditions or pedestrian behavior. Similarly, in medical imaging, it could improve the detection of subtle anomalies that might signal early disease stages.\n\nAI models that think like living brains\n\nCline and Hiramoto plan to enhance MovieNet\u2019s adaptability, expanding its capabilities across various environments and applications.\n\nThis includes refining the model to handle more complex scenarios and exploring its use in other fields, such as environmental monitoring and wildlife observation.\n\n\u201cTaking inspiration from biology will continue to be a fertile area for advancing AI,\u201d Cline said. \u201cBy designing models that think like living organisms, we can achieve levels of efficiency that simply aren\u2019t possible with conventional approaches.\u201d\n\nThe research team envisions a future where biologically inspired AI like MovieNet revolutionizes technology across sectors.\n\nBy replicating the brain\u2019s sophisticated processing abilities, MovieNet not only advances our understanding of AI but also opens doors to innovations that could redefine industries and improve lives.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "I see a lot of movies in theaters every year. Last year, I was pretty pleased with my total of 79 trips to my local multiplex but for 2024, I set myself the goal of hitting triple-digits. Over the past 12 months, I\u2019ve seen 104 movies in theaters, and that number will rise even higher before the clock strikes midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nSeeing more than 100 movies in theaters in a calendar year has given me a pretty good overall gauge of 2024 in film. I saw all the major blockbusters from \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d to \u201cWicked\u201d as well as smaller indie releases and a couple of foreign flicks, too. I also endured some of the year\u2019s low points on the silver screen, including \u201cMadame Web\u201d and the \u201cBorderlands\u201d movie.\n\nLike any self-respecting movie buff, I keep a ranked list of everything I see in theaters each year (and there were some tough movies to place in 2024). Below you\u2019ll find the 10 movies that had me eager to book a second screening and the 10 that had me tempted to walk out early. These are the best and worst movies of 2024 from somebody who saw a whole lot of them. And if you need more recommendations check out the top 3 Netflix movies right now.\n\nMy 10 favorite movies of 2024\n\n10. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019\n\nKINDS OF KINDNESS | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf you\u2019d told me at the start of the year that \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d would make my best of 2024 list, I\u2019d have been pretty surprised. That\u2019s not because of the talent involved; I\u2019ve enjoyed much of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 work and the cast is stacked (Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, yes please). Rather, I approached this black comedy with skepticism because it\u2019s an anthology movie comprised of three separate short stories.\n\nI typically struggle with anthology movies as I find the shift between narratives halts any momentum, and if even one of the chapters fails to connect with you that\u2019s potentially as much as a third of the flick written off. However, \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is a rare exception. Each of its three warped tales worked for me, and even just picking a favorite would be tough. Plus, it helps that \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is somewhat tonally similar to Lanthimos\u2019 2017 flick \u201cThe Killing of a Scared Deer\u201d which is my favorite entry in the Greek director's filmography.\n\nWatch now on Hulu\n\n9. \u2018Conclave\u2019\n\nCONCLAVE - Official Trailer [HD] - Only In Theaters October 25 - YouTube Watch On\n\n\u201cConclave\u201d is a 2024 movie that I know I\u2019m going to be recommending nonstop for years to come. The secretive process for picking a new pope might not sound like the ideal framework for a compelling mystery thriller, but it proves to be fertile ground for intrigue and strong character development. The Edward Berger movie follows a well-respected Cardinal (Ralph Fiennes) as he uncovers a web of secrets while overseeing the election of the next pope.\n\nFiennes is phenomenal in the lead role, playing a conflicted man of faith who is torn between duty, faith, and ambition, and the supporting cast around him is equally strong. Big kudos to Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Sergio Castellitto. Based on the best-selling Robert Harris novel of the same name, \u201cConclave\u201d crackles with compelling dialogue, but it\u2019s the tense atmosphere that sucked me in. I can't wait to rewatch this thriller over the holidays.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n8. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019\n\nSing Sing | Official Trailer HD | A24 - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhen the credits rolled on \u201cSing Sing\u201d, I didn\u2019t know whether to burst into tears of joy or stand up and applaud Colman Domingo for his awards-caliber performance. This is a prison drama with a real heart. Rather than being about gang violence or an audacious escape attempt like so much of the genre, it\u2019s a soulful flick about a group of prisoners that find solace in a theater group that allows them to become somebody else entirely for just a moment.\n\nThe emotions are so raw in this movie that while writing this blurb I threw on the trailer to refresh my memory, and got literal chills all over again. Domingo is breathtaking in the lead role of Divine G, a wrongly convicted prisoner who operates as the group leader. But he\u2019s matched by Clarence \"Divine Eye\" Maclin playing a fictionalized version of himself who is a newcomer to the group. If you need a spiritual boost then \u201cSing Sing\u201d will deliver in spades.\n\n7. \u2018Juror No. 2\u2019\n\nJuror #2 | Official Trailer | Max - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf I were to rank the movies on this list based purely on entertainment factor, then \u201cJuror No. 2\u201d would compete for the top spot. The latest (and reportedly last) film from cinema legend Clint Eastwood, it\u2019s a legal thriller that lacks filmmaking panache but packs an engaging premise that is well-delivered thanks to solid script work. If you need a movie that will have you absorbed from start to finish, you don\u2019t need to look any further.\n\nNicholas Hoult plays a recovering alcoholic, now family man, who is selected for the jury of a high-profile murder case. Things take an uncomfortable turn when he realizes he might be responsible (inadvertently) for the crime rather than the man on trial. Toni Collette adds steely determination as the prosecutor, and J.K. Simmons is having a blast as a fellow juror. \u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is the sort of intelligent adult-targeting drama we don\u2019t see as much in the theatrical space these days, but I really wish we did.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n6. \u2018Hit Man\u2019\n\nHit Man | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On\n\nI suspect the vast majority of people watched \u201cHit Man\u201d on their televisions when it landed on Netflix over the summer, so I consider myself supremely fortunate to have seen this crime-comedy on the big screen because Glen Powell is a movie star with a capital M and films like this belong in the theater. Directed by Richard Linklater, and co-written by Linklater and Powell, it\u2019s a movie with a little bit of everything. There\u2019s comedy, drama, thrills and a healthy dash of romance.\n\nPowell plays a fake contract killer working as part of a police sting operation who must adopt the hitman persona for real when he gets romantically involved with a woman in need (Adria Arjona). The chemistry between Arjona and Powell is practically off the chart, and I also love that \u201cHit Man\u201d is perfectly OK with being very silly at points. The montage of Powell dressing up as various types of assassins is a scene I often rewatch when I need a quick laugh.\n\nWatch now on Netflix\n\n5. \u2018The Substance\u2019\n\nTHE SUBSTANCE | Official Trailer | In Theaters & On MUBI Now - YouTube Watch On\n\nI find talking about \u201cThe Substance\u201d sort of tricky. That\u2019s not because it\u2019s bad. Its high placement on this list should speak to how highly I recommend it. Instead, \u201cThe Substance\u201d is tough to talk about because it\u2019s one of those movies that I think is best experienced when you know as little as possible before watching. I caught the dark thriller as part of a \u201cMystery Screening\u201d event at my local theater, and seeing it with practically zero prior awareness only elevated its impact.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m aware that for many people, movie-watching time is in short supply, so if you really need to know a little more before committing, it\u2019s a warped fable that follows a washed-up Hollywood star (played by a never-been-better Demi Moore) who takes a mysterious substance that promises to transform her into a younger, better version of herself (an also never-better Margaret Qualley), so long as she follows the rules. Spoiler: She does not.\n\nWatch now on Mubi\n\n4. \u2018Late Night with the Devil\u2019\n\nLate Night with the Devil: Official Trailer | Shudder - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe found footage format wore out its welcome in the horror genre pretty fast in the mid-2000s following the success of \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d and frankly, I always found the presentation style more limiting than immersive. However, \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d proved to me, that when used correctly, found footage can add a whole new layer of fear. This supernatural chiller is presented as an episode of a late-night talk show and things get nightmarish at a breakneck speed.\n\nDavid Dastmalchian plays Jack Delroy, a Johnny Carson type, who hosts \u201cNight Owls\u201d. To boost the rating for the struggling chat show the charismatic presenter invites a supposed possessed girl onto the set, and well, let\u2019s just say that things go south. The building sense of dread is almost palatable in \u201cLate Night with the Devil,\u201d and Dastmalchian is excellent in the lead role. There\u2019s also more occurring behind the scenes here than you might expect, and I enjoyed the movie\u2019s willingness to give us a peak beyond the cameras.\n\nWatch now on Hulu\n\n3. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019\n\nAlien: Romulus | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nFirst, I must clarify that I\u2019m extremely biased toward \u201cAlien: Romulus.\" The \u201cAlien\u201d franchise is my favorite in all of cinema, so even the bad \u201cAlien\u201d movies (yes, I\u2019m talking about you, \u201cAlien Covenant\u201d) are still pretty good in my books. But even when trying to look beyond my fandom, I still think \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d is a legacy sequel done right. I watched this one four times in theaters, and have seen it twice more on streaming, and I\u2019m already planning my next rewatch. That\u2019s a sign that \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d understands the franchise.\n\nEven as a superfan, I can acknowledge director Fede \u00c1lvarez overindulgence in fanservice (and the inclusion of a deepfake Ian Holm was unwise), but I can forgive a few corny callbacks when practically everything else is awesome. Newcomers Caille Spaeny and David Jonsson prove to be capable of carrying the weight of this iconic franchise, and finally, the Xenomorph has been made scary again. Plus, the production design is immaculate (I adore the nods to Alien: Isolation), and the ambitious finale takes a big swing and lands.\n\nWatch now on Hulu\n\n2. \u2018Challengers\u2019\n\nCHALLENGERS | Official Trailer 2 - YouTube Watch On\n\nSappy romantic drama \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d recently proved that a nonlinear narrative can do more harm than good, but \u201cChallengers\u201d is an example of the structure being used to great effect. This sports drama set in the world of professional tennis has no right to be this compelling. And a large part of the reason it grips you right from the very first serve is that its layers are slowly peeled away as we zip about the timeline learning more about the core trio.\n\nAnd what a central trio. Zendaya, Josh O\u2019Connor and Mike Faist have enough chemistry that it\u2019s advisable to wear safety goggles while watching. Though prepare for them to steam up quite a bit as director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s trademark raw sexual energy can be felt in almost every frame of \u201cChallengers.\" Credit to the Italian filmmaker too for some widely inventive shots, most prominently a final act rally where the camera becomes the tennis ball pinging over the net. The fact that \u201cChallengers\u201d is being ignored this awards season is a true outrage.\n\nWatch now on Prime Video\n\n1. \u2018Dune Part Two\u2019\n\nDune: Part Two | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nI\u2019m not going to win any points for originality for selecting \u201cDune Part Two\u201d as my favorite movie of 2024, but sometimes the frontrunner deserves its place at the top of the pack. A great testament to just how riveting I found this sci-fi epic is that I first saw it at a midnight screening, mere hours before catching an overseas flight, and having worked all day beforehand. My eyelids felt heavy before the trailers had finished, but moments later, I was wide awake. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s sequel demanded my attention from the first, truly stunning, moment, and my exhaustion was a nonfactor for the next two and a half hours.\n\n\u201cDune Part Two\u201d is one of those rare movies that gets so much right it\u2019s sort of hard to know where to begin (especially when you\u2019re trying to offer a concise write-up). The cast list is truly stacked, and everybody brings their A-game (big shouts to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler), but what really captivated me throughout this second chapter of Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d saga is the massive scale. Recently, Hollywood blockbusters feel increasingly small in scope \u2014 often due to an over-reliance on CGI that makes everything feel glossy and fake \u2014 but \u201cDune Part Two\u201d doesn\u2019t have that problem. It really does feel like being transported to a new world and then swept up in an enthralling tale stuffed with drama, excitement, adventure and high-stakes revelations.\n\nWatch now on Max\n\n10 worst movies of 2024\n\n10. \u2018The Crow'\n\nThe Crow (2024) Official Trailer - Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, FKA twigs, Danny Huston - YouTube Watch On\n\nRemaking \"The Crow\" seemed like an ill-fated idea from the very start. The '90s cult classic is very much a product of its era, and with lead actor Brandon Lee tragically losing his life on set after an accident involving a prop gun, it's taken on a macabre mythical status with many fans. But unsurprisingly that didn't stop the Hollywood machine, and after years in development purgatory, in August this new spin on \"The Crow\" took flight, and quickly flamed out.\n\nBill Skarsg\u00e5rd and FKA Twig play the lead roles of doomed lovers, and there's just one problem: They have zero on-screen chemistry. This is a major issue when the entire movie hangs on Eric Draven's (Skarsg\u00e5rd) quest for revenge in the wake of a grim tragedy. It also takes a ludicrously long time for Draven to earn the eponymous moniker and become a vengeful anti-hero. A gleefully violent action sequence within an opera house offers a brief reprieve from the somber tone, but it's not enough to save this completely pointless remake.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon and Apple\n\n9. \u2018Imaginary\u2019\n\nImaginary (2024) Official Trailer \u2013 DeWanda Wise, Tom Payne, Taegen Burns - YouTube Watch On\n\nIt\u2019s hard to take a horror movie seriously when the antagonist is a stuffed bear named Chauncey. Of course, \u201cImaginary\u201d could have gone the horror-comedy route in a similar vein to the classic \u201cChild\u2019s Play\u201d franchise or more modern efforts like \u201cM3GAN\u201d but instead this frustratingly bland supernatural horror plays things bizarrely safe. The spooks never moving beyond jump scares is another missed opportunity. Frankly, I've seen more frightful kid\u2019s movies.\n\n\u201cImaginary\u201d follows a woman named Jessica (DeWanda Wise) who moves back to her childhood home with her new husband (Tom Payne) and stepdaughters. Once there an imaginary friend from her youth resurfaces, and you can probably predict where things go next. While there is nothing egregiously bad about this Jeff Wadlow-helmed time-waster \u201cImaginary\u201d\u2019s biggest crime is that it\u2019s so forgettable it barely registers just hours later.\n\nWatch now on Starz\n\n8. \u2018The Watchers\u2019\n\nTHE WATCHERS | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nIshana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan (who serves as a producer on this movie), clearly took some filmmaking lessons from dear old dad. The only problem is that \u201cThe Watchers\u201d packs all the worst traits of Shyamalan\u2019s divisive school of directing. Namely, the entire movie is constructed around a predictable twist that I suspect most viewers will figure out within the first third of the movie\u2019s 100-minute runtime.\n\nWith the shock of the movie\u2019s narrative wrinkle removed, \u201cThe Watcher\u201d has practically nothing else to offer viewers. The somber tone doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere, it just makes the whole thing feel monotonous, and a very wooden performance from Dakota Fanning doesn\u2019t help matters either. I don\u2019t want to bash a first-time director too much, but I hope that if Ishana Night Shyamalan steps behind the camera again she will seek to break beyond her father\u2019s shadow because frankly, M. Night\u2019s record is so spotty it makes for poor inspiration.\n\nWatch now on Max\n\n7. \u2018Borderlands\u2019\n\nBorderlands (2024) Official Trailer - Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black - YouTube Watch On\n\nA calamitous box office bomb, and an unwelcome throwback to the era of awful video game adaptation, \u201cBorderlands\u201d was the internet\u2019s punching bag for much of the summer movie season. Heck, here at Tom\u2019s Guide we got in a few jabs ourselves, with staff writer Martin Shore giving it a one-star review and labeling it a \u201cmess\u201d. But you know what, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as unwatchable as its reputation would suggest. I even wrote an op-ed offering a very lukewarm rebuttal to the claims it was one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nI do think it\u2019s a bad movie (it\u2019s made No. 7 on my worst-of-the-year list after all), but I found a few flecks of fun in this zany action-comedy. However, the flaws are apparent, and several of them verge on fatal. The biggest is that pretty much the entire cast is wrong for their roles \u2014 Kevin Hart as gruff soldier Roland is a choice \u2014 also the sanitized PG-13 tone doesn\u2019t fit the Borderland universe, and the narrative is flimsy at best. Franky, there are very few reasons to watch this poor action flick, but worst movie of all time material? Not for me.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n6. \u2018Night Swim\u2019\n\nNight Swim | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\n\u201cNight Swim\u201d is a horror movie about a haunted swimming pool that proceeds to have zero fun with such a ludicrously stupid idea. This should have been a tongue-in-cheek horror that constantly pokes fun at its own ridiculousness, but writer/director Bryce McGuire opts for a more straight-laced approach instead. This decision results in a stilled horror movie that lacks scares, tension, atmosphere, or pretty much anything to keep audiences interested.\n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking that escaping a haunting swimming pool would be fairly straightforward (you just get out of the pool\u2026), but \u201cNight Swim\u201d goes to farcical lengths to keep its cast bobbing around the murky waters for a painstakingly dull 98 minutes. Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon are much better than the material they are presented with here, and even almost a year later (this one hit theaters in January 2024), I still cannot get over the movie\u2019s refusal to have fun with the idea of an evil backyard pool.\n\nWatch now on Prime Video\n\n5. \u2018Madame Web\u2019\n\nMADAME WEB \u2013 Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On\n\n\u201cMadame Web\u201d is another big-budget bomb that took a serious beating on social media. And while it wasn\u2019t the worst effort that Sony\u2019s interconnected comic book universe had to offer this year (we\u2019ll get to that shortly), it was still pretty darn horrendous. I\u2019d go as far as to say it makes \u201cMoribious\u201d look pretty good in comparison. However, it feels unfair to lay all the blame at the feet of director S. J. Clarkson as \u201cMadame Web\u201d displays all the hallmarks of intense studio interference.\n\nThe entire movie borders on incoherent with scenes that appear to have been chopped up in the editing room and some of the worst ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) I\u2019ve ever seen in a Hollywood blockbuster. Things aren\u2019t helped by Dakota Johnson\u2019s ill-fitting performance as lead Cassandra Webb. Her deadpan delivery clashes with the rest of the cast, and stands in stark contrast to villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) whose performance borders on pantomime-levels of subtly. But at least we got some funny memes from this one.\n\nWatch now on Netflix\n\n4. \u2018Venom: The Last Dance\u2019\n\nVENOM: THE LAST DANCE \u2013 Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On\n\nI have never cared for the \u201cVenom\u201d movies so I approached \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d with virtually no expectations, and still came away feeling like it had failed to reach them. Billed as the final installment in the franchise (for now at least), \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is less a fond farewell and more an unwelcome reminder that the comic book movie genre has fallen off a cliff quality-wise in the last four years. At least Sony has iced its cinematic universe now, so there's a silver lining.\n\nIf you like messy CGI effects, a generic narrative that revolves around hunting for a meaningless McGuffin, and dialogue so excruciatingly painful that I actually winced numerous times, then perhaps you\u2019ll have some fun with \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d, but otherwise skip this one. Even a very committed Tom Hardy can\u2019t save this superhero stinker. In fact, Hardy\u2019s overeager performance only adds to the sheer awfulness and you'll wish he'd tone it down. A truly miserable trilogy closer.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n3. \u2018Argylle\u2019\n\nArgylle | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nAll the movies listed above are bad, but at least most of them have the good sense to conclude within less than two hours, but not \u201cArgylle\u201d. This spy-flavored action-comedy clocks in 140 minutes long, and it feels every single second of its bloated runtime. To be frank, this movie was always facing an uphill battle to win my affection. I never connected with Matthew Vaughn\u2019s \u201cKingsman\u201d franchise, and \u201cArgylle\u201d is the same shtick but worst in every department. The reasonably likable characters and well-crafted action are gone, but the cheesy comedy, poor narrative construction and oversaturated color pallet have been retained and expanded.\n\nI also feel it\u2019s important to call out how misleading the movie\u2019s marketing was. Henry Cavill was placed front of center (with popstar Dua Lipa also often showcased alongside him), but both barely feature, the real stars are Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell. Both are fine but lacking charm. Even a supporting cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston and Catherine O\u2019Hara can\u2019t save this messy blockbuster that reportedly cost $200 million and grossed less than half.\n\nWatch now on Apple TV Plus\n\n2. \u2018Afraid\u2019\n\nAFRAID - Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On\n\nI suppose there\u2019s something ironic about \u201cAfraid\u201d. This cautionary tale about the dangers of AI feels very much like it could have been written by a computer program instead of a human being. Playing out like the worst episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d ever made (which is really saying something as Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi anthology has dropped a couple of clankers of its own), \u201cAfraid\u201d is pretty much only good for a few laughs at the movie\u2019s expense as it muddles its way through cliche social commentary that is on the nose it feels almost intentionally bad.\n\nAt least \u201cAfraid\u201d runs a mere 84 minutes (including credits), but even this saving grace isn\u2019t enough to save the movie from earning a deserved spot on this list. John Cho and Katherine Waterson labor through some awful material with dialogue that had me clutching my face in second-hand embarrassment (one character actually uses the word \u201cwoke\u201d at one point...). The only thing scary about \u201cAfraid\u201d is that I wasted a whole evening watching it in my local cinema.\n\nWatch now on Netflix\n\n1. \u2018Megalopolis\u2019\n\nMegalopolis (2024) Official Trailer - Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhen it comes to movies, I have one very strict rule: I finish once I\u2019ve started. I have only walked out of a movie before the credits rolled once (and on that occasion it wasn\u2019t because of the movie\u2019s quality), but \u201cMegalopolis\u201d seriously tested my resolve. Sitting through this incomprehensibly awful slop, I couldn\u2019t help but imagine all the better things I could be doing with my time, and the exit door looked extremely appealing. Out of a sense of stubbornness, and feeling that I couldn\u2019t fairly rank this movie as the worst of the year without seeing it through to the end, I stuck around. And frankly, I probably should have just walked out sooner.\n\n\u201cMegalopolis\u201d is a complete and utter mess. Apparently, there\u2019s a plotline about an architect named Cesar (Adam Driver) trying to create a perfect society named Megalopolis but that\u2019s news to me because the movie I watched presented me with indecipherable nonsense. The cast is universally terrible \u2014 bar Aubrey Plaza who is seemingly aware she\u2019s in hot garbage and plays to the cheap seats \u2014 and the self-satisfied message feels tacky and frankly condescending. It\u2019s the movie equivalent of that time Gal Gadot and her celebrity pals sang \u201cImagine.\" Francis Ford Coppola is a masterful director, but what was he thinking here?\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple"

Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

            "article_content": "The field of materials science is no stranger to unexpected breakthroughs. A recent example comes from the University of Hong Kong, where Professor Mingxin Huang and his team have developed a groundbreaking stainless steel for hydrogen production. This innovation, dubbed SS-H2, exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional materials like titanium.\n\nThe discovery of SS-H2 is particularly intriguing due to its sequential dual-passivation mechanism. This unique property allows the steel to resist corrosion in chloride media up to an ultra-high potential of 1700 mV, surpassing the limitations of conventional stainless steel. Dr. Kaiping Yu, the first author of the study, remarked, \u201cMn-based passivation is a counter-intuitive discovery that cannot be explained by current knowledge in corrosion science.\u201d\n\nThis breakthrough could revolutionize hydrogen production from renewable sources, potentially reducing structural material costs by up to 40 times. Such advancements in green hydrogen technology align with efforts to develop AI-powered sailboats for green hydrogen production, further pushing the boundaries of sustainable energy solutions.\n\nUnexplained phenomena in energy research\n\nThe quest for efficient and sustainable energy sources has led to several unexplained discoveries. One such example is the development of a tiny nuclear battery capable of operating for 7,000 years. This groundbreaking energy solution challenges our understanding of long-term power generation and storage.\n\nIn the realm of hydrogen technology, researchers continue to encounter puzzling phenomena. Recent advancements have led to the creation of a new catalyst that enhances efficiency and reduces emissions in hydrogen engines. These innovations often emerge from unexpected sources and defy initial scientific predictions.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of these unexplained phenomena on energy research, consider the following table :\n\nTechnology Conventional Understanding Unexplained Breakthrough Stainless Steel Limited corrosion resistance SS-H2 with ultra-high potential resistance Nuclear Batteries Short lifespan 7,000-year operational capacity Hydrogen Engines High emissions New catalyst for cleaner operation\n\nThe role of serendipity in scientific breakthroughs\n\nMany unexplained phenomena in science arise from serendipitous discoveries. The development of SS-H2 is a prime example of how unexpected results can lead to significant advancements. Initially, the research team was skeptical of their findings, as the prevailing view suggested that manganese impairs the corrosion resistance of stainless steel.\n\nThis serendipitous discovery highlights the importance of :\n\nOpen-mindedness in scientific research\n\nRigorous testing and validation of unexpected results\n\nChallenging established scientific paradigms\n\nCollaboration between different scientific disciplines\n\nThe journey from initial discovery to potential industrial application of SS-H2 took nearly six years, emphasizing the patience and persistence required in unraveling unexplained phenomena. Professor Huang noted, \u201cOur strategy overcame the fundamental limitation of conventional stainless steel and established a paradigm for alloy development applicable at high potentials.\u201d\n\nFuture implications of unexplained scientific phenomena\n\nAs scientists continue to grapple with unexplained events and discoveries, the potential for groundbreaking applications grows. The development of SS-H2, for instance, could dramatically reduce the cost of structural components in water electrolyzers, making green hydrogen production more economically viable.\n\nThese unexplained phenomena often lead to :\n\nNew research directions and funding opportunities Interdisciplinary collaborations to solve complex problems Technological innovations with far-reaching impacts Paradigm shifts in scientific understanding\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s crucial to remain open to the unexpected and unexplained in scientific research. By embracing these mysteries, we pave the way for transformative discoveries that can shape the future of technology, energy, and our understanding of the natural world."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents GPT o1 GPT o1-mini GPT-4o GPT-4o mini GPT-4 Early versions\n\nWe\u2019re now into the third year of the AI boom, and industry leaders are showing no signs of slowing down, pushing out newer and (presumably) more capable models on a regular basis. ChatGPT, of course, remains the undisputed leader.\n\nBut with more than a half-dozen models available from OpenAI alone, figuring out which one to use for your specific project can be a daunting task.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nGPT o1\n\nIf you want to try out the best and brightest model for ChatGPT, look no further than o1.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman spent a better part of his summer in 2024 teasing the imminent release of the company\u2019s secretive Project Strawberry. The company finally unveiled Project Strawberry in September, outing it as OpenAI\u2019s first \u201creasoning\u201d model and renaming it \u201co1.\u201d Much like the two-stage release of GPT-2, where a stripped-down version was released months ahead of the full-feature version, GPT Plus subscribers were first given access to the o1-preview version.\n\nAs a reasoning model, o1 is touted as using humanlike reasoning to check its own answers before outputting more accurate responses to complicated science, math, and coding queries. Trained on a \u201ccompletely new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset specifically tailored for it,\u201d per the company, o1 drastically outperforms the GPT-4o family of models across industry benchmark tests.\n\nThe full version of OpenAI o1 made its debut in December 2024 during the company\u2019s 12 Days of OpenAI livestream event. Its internal system of checks reportedly helps the new model hallucinate less than its predecessors. According to OpenAI\u2019s tests, the new version of o1 reduces \u201cmajor errors\u201d on \u201cdifficult real-world questions\u201d by 34% compared to its preview version. If you\u2019ve got reams of highly complex data to pour over or have complicated math and coding problems to solve, o1 is the OpenAI model you\u2019ll want to use.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not currently available to free-tier users (and likely won\u2019t be for quite some time). You can access o1 with a Plus or Teams subscription, though you\u2019ll only get 50 messages with it per week at that level. You\u2019ll need to shell out $200 monthly for a Pro subscription if you want to use it without limits. So, our recommendation would be to start out on 01, and if you run out of your allotted messages for the day, move on to one of the models below.\n\nGPT o1-mini\n\nOpenAI\u2019s o1-mini is a lightweight version of the company\u2019s larger reasoning model. It is geared more toward quickly solving challenging mathematics and coding problems rather than creative prose generation. It\u2019s built for speed and designed to provide fast, efficient solutions for specific technical tasks, making it ideal for task automation.\n\nUnlike the preview model, you can still access o1-mini, though you will need at least a Plus subscription. With Plus, you\u2019ll get 50 messages a day with OpenAI o1-mini. Pro subscribers, aka the folks shelling out $200 a month, have unlimited access to the mini model.\n\nGPT-4o is to GPT-4 in terms of performance what GPT-4 was to GPT-3.5. Introduced in May 2024, GPT-4o (the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni\u201d) is OpenAI\u2019s \u201clatest, fastest, highest intelligence model.\u201d It offers human-level response times (critical for features like Advanced Voice Mode), improved performance with languages beyond English, and a far better understanding of vision and audio content.\n\nNot only is this model faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective than its predecessors, but 4o has also achieved state-of-the-art results in multilingual and vision benchmark tests. It also offers a 128,000-character context window and can generate text, images, audio, and computer code. It recently received a minor boost to its creative writing skills thanks to a pre-Thanksgiving update.\n\nYou can access GPT-4o through the free tier of ChatGPT, but you will run into restrictive usage caps. Once you reach your limit with 4o, the platform will drop your access down to either 4o-mini or the older GPT-4-Turbo model. Subscribing to the $20-per-month Plus tier will significantly increase that usage cap.\n\nGPT-4o mini\n\nOpenAI\u2019s \u201clightest-weight intelligence model\u201d is GPT-4o mini. Designed more for completing computationally simple tasks performed quickly and repeatedly as opposed to pondering over challenging coding or analytical problems, 4o mini offers nearly all of the same features as the larger 4o model, save for its restricted access to some of the more advanced analytical tools.\n\nGPT-4o mini is available to Plus and Pro subscribers, and you can select it from the drop-down model list in the upper left corner of the ChatGPT home screen. You can also access it as a free-tier user by blowing through your GPT-40 usage allowance. The platform will shunt you over to the 4o mini model until you come off cool down and are allowed to access GPT-4o again.\n\nGPT-4 was the first big step up in ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities since its debut. Launched in April 2023 alongside the new ChatGPT Plus subscription tier, GPT-4 powered both ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s free Copilot platform. OpenAI touted GPT-4 as \u201cmore reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\u201d It was also the company\u2019s first multimodal model, allowing it to generate and analyze images and audio in addition to text.\n\nGPT-4 still serves as the base model available for free-tier ChatGPT users. For most casual users, GPT-4 and its \u201comni\u201d variants are plenty capable of performing the inference tasks that you need.\n\nEarly versions\n\nGPT-1, the original large language model from OpenAI, made its debut in June 2018 and became the archetype of generative pre-trained transformer technology. Even in its earliest form, GPT-1 managed to outperform the state-of-the-art models of the time by nearly 6% at natural language inference tasks.\n\nIts 1.5-billion-parameter successor, GPT-2, arrived in November 2019. It expanded upon GPT-1\u2019s basic text generation capabilities to include answering questions, summarizing documents, and translating text between languages. GPT-3 arrived in May 2020 but was quickly snatched up by Microsoft that September with a licensing scheme that gives Microsoft exclusive use of that model.\n\nThe GPT-3.5 model is a subset of Microsoft\u2019s licensed GPT-3 that offered better performance and a later knowledge cutoff date than earlier iterations. When OpenAI launched the ChatGPT platform in November 2022, the chatbot ran atop the GPT-3.5 model. The company incorporated web browsing capabilities the following April, but by May 2023, GPT-3.5 had been depreciated in favor of the far more capable GPT-4 family of models. As such, it\u2019s no longer available for public use and can only be accessed through OpenAI\u2019s developer API."

            "article_content": "Suchir Balaji, the 26-year-old OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower, was found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, US last month. His death on November 26 was determined suicide by the San Francisco medical examiner's office as police found no evidence of wrong doing.\n\nBalaji, who left OpenAI in August, has spoken out against the artificial intelligence company's practice of training the chatbot on copyrighted material scraped from the internet very openly in recent months. The artificial intelligence (AI) giant has been fighting several lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices.\n\nAbout Suchir Balaji\n\nIndian American Suchir Balaji grew up in Cupertino, California. A remarkably sharp kid, he excelled in programming contests, placing 31st in the ACM ICPC 2018 World Finals and winning first place in the 2017 Pacific Northwest Regional and Berkeley Programming Contests.\n\nBalaji also secured 7th place in Kaggle's TSA-sponsored \"Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge,\" earning a $100,000 prize. Per his LinkedIn profile, he was the US Open 2016 National Champion and a USACO Finalist.\n\nLike most others in his field, Balaji had been captivated by the promise of artificial intelligence since an early age. In an interview given to the New York Times in October, he mentioned his interest in AI started after he stumbled across a news story about the technology in his teens and imagined that neural networks could solve humanity's greatest problems.\n\n\"I thought that AI was a thing that could be used to solve unsolvable problems, like curing diseases and stopping ageing...I thought we could invent some kind of scientist that could help solve them,\" he said, according to the NYT report.\n\nEven before graduating, he worked at Scale AI, Helia, and was a Software Engineer at Quora. In 2020, Balaji joined a stream of Berkeley grads who went to work for OpenAI.\n\nSuchir Balaji's Time At OpenAI\n\nHe worked at OpenAI for four years, during which for one and half years, he helped gather and organize the enormous amounts of internet data the company used to build its online chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nBalaji told NYT that during his initial data at OpenAI, he did not carefully consider whether the company had a legal right to build its products using both copyrighted and open internet data. It was only after the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 that he started to contemplate the issue and realised that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet by using copyrighted data, violating the law in the process.\n\nBy 2024, Balaji said realised \"he no longer wanted to contribute to technologies that he believed would bring society more harm than benefit.\" He left the company in August this year without any new job and started working on what he called \"personal projects.\"\n\nHe died a day after he was named in a court filing as someone whose files OpenAI would search as part of a lawsuit brought by those who sued the AI giant.\n\nSuchir Balaji's Allegation Against OpenAI\n\nAfter leaving OpenAI, Suchir Balaji spoke out publicly against the way AI companies are using copyrighted data to create their technologies. He alleged that the AI models were too dependent on the labour of others as they are trained on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without authorisation.\n\n\"This is not a sustainable model for the internet ecosystem as a whole,\" he told the NYT.\n\nHe also explained his concerns on his personal website, where he noted that while generative models rarely produce outputs identical to their training data, the act of replicating copyrighted material during training could violate laws if not protected under \"fair use.\"\n\n\"Because fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, no broad statement can be made about when generative AI qualifies for fair use,\" he noted.\n\nBalaji argued in several cases the chatbots directly compete with the copyrighted works they learned from. \"Generative models are designed to imitate online data, so they can substitute for \"basically anything\" on the internet, from news stories to online forums,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, the biggest problem is that with AI technologies gradually replacing existing internet services, they sometimes produce \"false and sometimes completely made-up information - what researchers call \"hallucinations.\"\"\n\nThe internet, he said, is changing for the worse.\n\nAllegations Against AI Companies\n\nBalaji was not alone in his concerns about AI companies misusing copyrighter data to train their chatbots. Several US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, have filed lawsuits against OpenAI and its primary partner, Microsoft, claiming they used millions of their articles to build chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.\n\nMany best-selling writers, including John Grisham, also have filed lawsuits against the company.\n\nOpenAI Disputes Claims\n\nOpenAI has disputed Balaji's claims, insisting that their data use adhered to fair use principles and legal precedents.\n\n\"We build our AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by longstanding and widely accepted legal precedents. We view this principle as fair to creators, necessary for innovators, and critical for US competitiveness,\" OpenAI said in a statement.\n\nThe company told BBC in November that its software is \"grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation\".\n\nReacting to BAlaji's death, a spokesperson for OpenAI said, \"We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time.\""

Collecting tchotchkes, our ancestors potentially comforting or sheltering one another in the face of a cataclysmic disaster, or building owl toys for children show how caring we can be as a species. However, other findings can reveal our darker side.\n\nThat more bleak part of human nature can be found in the bones uncovered from an archeological site in Charterhouse Warren, Somerset, England. A team recently analyzed over 3,000 bones found there decades ago that date back to the Early Bronze Age. The remains of at least 37 individuals here were killed, butchered, and likely partially eaten before they were thrown down a shaft that is 49-feet-deep. The analysis is detailed in a study published December 15 in the journal Antiquity and represents the largest-scale example of interpersonal violence from British prehistory.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The bones belonged to a mixture of men, women, and children, which likely means they were representative of a community.\n\nExamples of cranial trauma. Top) perimortem injury to the left posterior of the frontal bone (a), cutmarks can also be seen on the frontal bone (b) and patinated bevel of the internal cranial surface is apparent around the injury (c); middle) cranium with a perforating injury to mid-frontal bone (d), a closer view shows radiating fracture lines (e) and the internal view shows patinated bevel (f ); bottom) adult cranium (g), close inspection shows cutmarks running along the mid-frontal (h) and a perimortem blunt force fracture to the conjoining right frontal bone fragment (i) Images by Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024. CREDIT: Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nSearching for motivation\u2013and a reason for cannibalism\n\nThe skulls have evidence of a violent death from blunt force trauma, unlike the majority of contemporary burials. Researchers from multiple institutions further analyzed the bones to try and learn more about how these people died. They found several cutmarks and fractures that occurred at or near the time of death on the bones. The team believes that this is evidence that they were intentionally butchered and may have been partly consumed.\n\nTo find clues to why people in Early Bronze Age Britain might cannibalize their dead, they looked at the nearby Palaeolithic site of Gough\u2019s Cave in Cheddar Gorge. Evidence uncovered there suggests that cannibalism was likely a funeral rite in the area. However, Charterhouse Warren is a bit different. The evidence of a violent death with no indication of a fight or struggle implies that the victims were caught off guard. The team believes it is likely that they were all massacred and the butchering was done by their enemies.\n\n[ Related: Bronze Age village was \u2018pretty cozy\u2019\u2014until Britain\u2019s Pompeii. ]\n\nAbundant cattle bones have been found mixed in with the human bones suggests that people at Charterhouse Warren probably had enough to eat, so it is unlikely that they were killed strictly for food.\n\nInstead, cannibalism may have been a way to \u201cother\u201d and dehumanize the deceased. The killers were likening their enemies to animals by eating their flesh and mixing their bones in with animal bones.\n\n\u2018People in prehistory could match more recent atrocities\u2019\n\nThe conflict was likely caused by social factors. Theft or insults may have led to tensions which then escalated out of proportion. Additionally, two of the children had evidence of plague in their teeth. The fear of such a deadly illness may have also exacerbated tensions. Scientists at the The Francis Crick Institute found these signs of plague at Charterhouse Warren in a 2023 study and they were a \u201ccompletely unexpected\u201d finding, according to Schulting. However, the team still does not know what\u2013if any\u2013impact plague had on this conflict.\n\nRight hemi-mandible of child aged about 10 years (a) with detail of cutmarks on the ascending ramus (b). Image credit: Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024. CREDIT: Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nAs a whole, the discovery of such violence at Charterhouse Warren shows that in at least this instance, perceived slights and cycles of revenge could result in violent actions.\n\n\u201cCharterhouse Warren is one of those rare archaeological sites that challenges the way we think about the past,\u201d said Schulting. \u201cIt is a stark reminder that people in prehistory could match more recent atrocities and shines a light on a dark side of human behaviour. That it is unlikely to have been a one-off event makes it even more important that its story is told.\u201d"

            "article_content": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Scientists have introduced what they believe may be a new ancient human species.\n\nThe Juluren, or \"large head people,\" are believed to have lived in eastern Asia over 100,000 years ago.\n\nsuggesting that the Juluren, formally named Homo juluensis, possessed significantly large brains and unique traits that could dramatically alter our understanding of human evolution.\n\nThe Juluren exhibit has features unlike any other hominins previously identified. Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

            "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Cara\n\nThe digital art trends for 2025 will be driven mainly by two things: economic factors and the impact of new technology. On the plus side, we have all the exciting new tools that are enabling a revolution in the animation world, as demonstrated by Blender's use in one of 2024's best animated movies, Flow. We\u2019re seeing an explosion of creativity that only seems to get more interesting as the trend develops, with more innovative and individual animated work coming out each year.\n\nOn the downside, we have generative AI, which is already taking work away from artists and causing immense anxiety. But some of the reactions to this are positive: we have great new social media options like Cara, and the turn towards art styles that emphasise the human touch is bringing us some wonderful creative work.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as we go into next year and beyond, generative AI will move out of its wild west phase as the law begins to catch up with the shenanigans of AI companies. 2025 should be the year when AI is controlled and digital artists can perhaps see a brighter future.\n\nKey art of the animated film Flow\n\nTurning our minds back to the bleakness, we have the shrinking budgets in the TV and film industries to think of, as well as massive layoffs in the video games industry, and the state of the economy in general, which is not good.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to put a positive spin on any of that, but we can say that VFX and post production companies are doing some quite interesting things as they seek to diversify their businesses in response to these conditions, such as moving into immersive experiences, like Pac-Man Live, for example.\n\nA glimmer of hope for VFX companies in the UK comes in the form of the excellent new tax incentives that were announced in the recent budget, which are set to bring a huge chunk of work into the country - more on that below, as well as predictions from those working today in what digital artists can expect in 2025.\n\n1. Digital art trends 2025: immersive art projects\n\nThe downturn in the film industry has left VFX companies with capacity to work on other things, so we\u2019re seeing a move towards alternative creative offerings such as immersive experiences.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth DNEG and Cinesite launched immersive divisions in 2024, expanding the application of Hollywood-quality VFX to light projection at live events and VR within gaming, theme parks and more.\n\nThe video above is a great example; it shows you how Cinesite created a moving version of Rembrandt\u2019s The Storm on the Sea of Galilee for Frameless, an immersive art venue in London. Artists captured the look and energy of the painting to create a light projection that fills the room and washes over the visitors. We've been to Frameless, and it's a fantastic experience that combines pre-made VFX and animation with real-time Unreal Engine techniques.\n\nFrameless also recently announced a partnership with the National Portrait Gallery to do more of the same, again working with Cinesite. We can expect to see more of these kinds of collaborations as VFX companies look to diversify their businesses, including VFX studios entering into video games and advertising.\n\n2. Digital art trends 2025: new social media for artists\n\nDigital art trends 2025; a mozaic of images on Cara\n\nArtists have been growing increasingly frustrated with mainstream social media sites for some time now. In the absence of alternatives, digital artists haven\u2019t been able to do much about it. That\u2019s all changing now that art social site Cara, billed as an Instagram alternative, and Bluesky Social, an alternative to X, are gaining traction.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtists started to move away from Twitter and onto Bluesky last year when Elon Musk announced that Twitter data would be scraped and used to develop his xAI model. But the real surge of movement from Twitter to Bluesky is happening now, following the outcome of the US election, as people wish to distance themselves from Musk. As the platform grows, it becomes a more viable place for artists to find each other and to market themselves.\n\nCara\u2019s big moment happened in the summer of this year when Meta, owner of Instagram, made a similar announcement about using user data to train AI models. Artists were outraged and signed up in droves to Cara, an anti-AI social and portfolio platform for artists that puts creator\u2019s interests first. You can read my interview with the founder, Jingna Zhang for more details.\n\nBoth these platforms are young and tiny compared to Instagram and Twitter, but they offer a viable alternative to traditional social media for artists.\n\n3. Digital art trends 2025: the law takes on AI\n\nDigital art trends 2025; EGAIR website\n\nIn March this year the world\u2019s first comprehensive legal framework for mitigating the risks of AI was approved by the EU. The AI Act applies legal restrictions to what can be done with AI, and the area relating to the use of copyrighted works was one of the \u201cheaviest lobbied\u201d, according to the BBC.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we move into 2025, the AI Act will make its way through the next stages in the process of becoming law, and we\u2019ll get a better understanding of how much protection the law will give to creators. As it stands, the Act acknowledges the rights of copyright holders with respect to their work being used to train AI models, and requires AI companies to allow people to opt-out. (The European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation (EGAIR) website has more information on this.)\n\nThe other major legal spectacle to watch next year is the progress of the lawsuits in the US against Sta\u00adbil\u00adity AI, DeviantArt, Mid\u00adjour\u00adney, Run\u00adway AI and Google for using artists\u2019 copyrighted work to train models without their consent. The outcome of these cases will have big consequences for generative AI companies. You can keep up to date with the latest news at the Image Generator Litigation website.\n\n4. Digital art trends 2025: AI will mature\n\n04. The AI conversation will mature\n\nDigital art trends 2025; image generated with MidJourney\n\nAI-enabled tools can do some amazing things with graphics, video and audio that it\u2019s easy to get carried away and imagine they\u2019re having a bigger impact than they really are, especially in industries such as animation, VFX and post production. While AI is changing how particular tasks are undertaken, it\u2019s not yet bringing about structural change to the overall production process.\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal to say about this, but here are some broad strokes: Firstly, it takes time to integrate new tools effectively into large pipelines. Secondly, to work in a real-world professional environment, these tools need to be able to do very specific things in specific ways. So while a demo might seem very impressive, the tool might not be able to deliver the precise results that are required in live projects. And, of course, there is a healthy degree of caution in the industry around the use of generative AI models trained on datasets that contain copyrighted works without the consent of the rights holders.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDavid Lebensfeld, President and VFX Supervisor, Ingenuity Studios and Ghost VFX says: \"I think AI workflows and its general philosophy will continue to be discussed and evaluated all through 2025. I don't think we'll see meaningful change in how the whole production chain works because of AI, but I do think it will continue to be top of mind. It will continue to be in the zeitgeist because it is firmly planted and there is a lot of money around it.\"\n\nIndeed. The hype cycle will continue because a lot of money has been invested in these companies. But people are already starting to realise the limitations of AI, and next year the conversation will be tempered by a more realistic understanding of what AI can and can\u2019t do, and what it\u2019s really being used for today.\n\n5. Digital art trends 2025: tax breaks for VFX\n\nDigital art trends; gov.uk website\n\nDavid Lebensfeld also tells me that he expects the power of tax incentives to continue shaping the industry in 2025: \u201cWe'll see studios doubling down on their investment in tax incentivised regions,\" he says.\n\nThe UK is one region that will see a boost in 2025 as the long-awaited improvements to tax relief for VFX were announced in the last budget, following tireless campaigning by the UK Screen Alliance. From 1st January 2025, VFX spend in the UK will get a net rebate of 29.25 percent, and it won\u2019t be counted as part of the portion (80 percent) of overall expenditure for the film or TV project that is eligible for tax relief.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to the UK Screen Alliance: \u201cThe UK is now set to attract an additional \u00a3175 million per year of spending on VFX for film and TV, an increase of over 45 percent, and to create 2,800 new jobs.\u201d\n\n6. Digital art trends 2025: new animation styles\n\nDigital art trends 2025; santa claus\n\nThe creative revolution in animation based on the blending of 2D and 3D styles shows no sign of stopping; there\u2019s still much fertile ground to be explored and I expect to see more new and exciting art and animation styles and techniques next year.\n\nKapil Sharma, Animation Director at DNEG Animation, has this to say of the phenomenon: \u201cWith the rapid advancement of tools and techniques, artists are now able to achieve the feel and charm of traditional 2D or hand-drawn animation within the realm of 3D, and vice versa. It\u2019s incredible to see how these technologies are enabling new forms of creative expression, especially as they allow for a balance between the two worlds; retaining the warmth and expressiveness of 2D while taking advantage of the depth and versatility of 3D.\n\n\u201cWhat I find particularly exciting is how even within a similar style or look, there\u2019s still so much individuality in each project. Each animated film brings its own unique character to the table, which is a testament to how personal and dynamic this craft is. Character animation, in particular, has seen a remarkable evolution. We\u2019ve seen 3D films adopting the fluidity and charm of 2D hand-drawn animation, capturing that natural bounce and flow while maintaining the dimension of 3D. The movement doesn\u2019t feel overly polished or stiff, and it retains a certain organic, hand-crafted quality - conveying emotion and story through the subtle nuances of character movement.\u201d\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nSharma\u2019s most recent project is a Richard Curtis animation titled That Christmas, one of the year's best Christmas animations, made in collaboration with Locksmith Animation. He explains how these new tools and techniques were brought to bear on the project:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFor That Christmas we wanted to evoke the tactile, handmade feeling of stop-motion without going fully into the realm of two\u2019s or step animation. It was important to us that the characters' performances felt natural and human, we focused heavily on the eyes and their ability to convey emotion, and tried to keep that charming simplicity and not do secondary animation. I hope that audiences can sense this effort and feel the connection to the characters that we aimed to achieve.\n\n\u201cOverall, I feel like we\u2019re at a point where experimentation with 2D and 3D is limitless, there's so much potential for hybrid techniques to enhance storytelling, and I\u2019m eager to see how these trends continue to evolve.\u201d\n\n7. Digital art trends 2025: human-centred art\n\nStefan Falconer, Executive Creative Director at animation studio Golden Wolf, anticipates that the growing resistance to generative AI within the design community will be increasingly reflected in the creative work, as digital artists seek to underscore the difference between their output and that of an AI.\n\nWe\u2019ll see \u201ca sharp pivot toward bespoke, human-centred design,\u201d says Stefan. \u201cWe imagine a movement emerging that prioritises craft and artistry, inspiring designers to explore more traditional and maximalist approaches that celebrate creative skill and individuality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis idea goes hand-in-hand with the trend outlined above, as animators move away from the computer-generated lighting and textures of the traditional 3D look and towards a hand-painted style that infuses their 3D work with extra levels of human artistry.\n\nThe animated short An Almost Christmas Story, above, is an example of this trend towards traditional, human-made styles. Although it\u2019s all CG, the film looks like stop motion animation made with hand-crafted models - notice the trees at the start are made with twist-ties and twigs.\n\n8. Digital art trends 2025: more collaboration\n\nAdobe MAX 2024, Project Concept demo\n\nCollaboration tools in digital art software has been growing rapidly in recent years, whether that's in newer apps like Figma, Miro and Magma Studio that offer a mix of vector art, brainstorming sheets and shared canvases or in more established best digital art software such as Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint and Procreate.\n\nIn 2025 I expect to see collaboration tools and bespoke collaboration apps take off as more studios enable remote working and the need for new styles and approahes (as mentioned above) takes hold.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt won't simply be in traditional digital software either, as we saw in the summer when Adobe launched its new AI collaboration platform called Concept AI at Adobe Max. This enables multiple artists to generate AI images, iterate on them and add in original art to create new AI generations from, all within preset style boundaries.\n\n9. Digital art trends 2025: creator-first AI tools\n\nA vector image of a knight with a sword facing a dragon\n\nIn 2025 it feels like we'll be leaving the 'prompt era' behind and AI art tools will actually be useful, enhancing workflows rather that replacing artists work. Of course the same issue with copyrights persist, but established digital art software will develop and add AI tools that are actually useful for artists.\n\nThese AI tools are not text-to-image or text-to-video prompts but tools to add to your workflow. This can include AI in line with Adobe's Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Photoshop, or 3D texture creation in Substance Painter as well as many of the AI tools announced at this year's Adobe MAX Sneaks making their way into Adobe apps - including Project Turntable that can turn 2D images into 3D models.\n\nExpect more AI tools that offer procedural generation for textures, animation and rigging, as well as automation of tasks such as layouts and colour generation for scenes and style sheets.\n\nThe trend of making 3D modelling more approachable to 2D artists and graphic designers will continue, as platforms such as WOMP, Adobe Project Neo and Kaedim continue to develop, allowing simple stylised 3D model creation.\n\n10. Digital art trends 2025: new visual art trends\n\nDigital art trends 2025; a robot explodes\n\nRetro-futurism, simple line art and more stylised 3D in illustration will all likely emerge as visual trends in 2025. These are ideas that have been milling around for some time, but will make more of an impact next year and it's worth considering creating digital art that references these aesthetics.\n\nThe rise in stylised 3D in illustration is going to be huge next year as more 2D artists become accustomed to using simple 3D model generators like WOMP and Adobe Project Neo. Each enables illustrators to create simple models that can be added into 2D illustrations, painted over or manipulated, Adobe's new 3D Substance Viewer for Photoshop will also enable more high-end 3D models to be added to 2D art.\n\nThe other visual styles, such as retro-futurism, rely on stylised interpretations of vintage and retro styles, updated for modern tastes with bold colours, use of geometric shapes and a push for nostalgia. We've already seen how this approach is being popularised in video games like Moons of Darsalon, and expect to be applied more broadly to comic art, concept art and fantasy illustration. (After all, both vintage magazine brands Heavy Metal and Metal Hurlant are making a comeback in 2025.)\n\nIt's likely we'll see more simple, clean line art in illustration and digital art in 2025 as the world reacts to the sterile look of generated AI art and demands something that looks more human made. The clarity, calmness and honesty of line art could help offset the overly rendered look of AI art. Some of the drawing apps for creating line art include Illustrator, Procreate (read our Procreate tutorials) and Clip Studio Paint."

            "article_content": "In an unprecedented wave of collaboration, leading AI firms are teaming up\u2014sometimes with rivals\u2014to serve a Pentagon and Congress determined to put AI to military use. Their growing alignment may herald an era in which software firms seize the influence now held by old-line defense contractors.\n\n\u201cThere's an old saying that software eats the world,\u201d Byron Callan, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, told Investors Business Daily on Wednesday. \u201cIt's going to eat the military too.\"\n\nOver the last week, Palantir, Anduril, Shield AI, OpenAI, Booz Allen, and Oracle announced various partnerships to develop products tailored to defense needs. Meanwhile, the House passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act with provisions that push the Defense Department to work more closely with tech firms on AI, and DOD announced yet another office intended to foster AI adoption.\n\nPerhaps the most significant partnership is between Palantir and Anduril, two companies that offer somewhat competing capabilities related to battlefield data integration. Palantir holds the contract for the Maven program, the seminal Defense Department AI effort to derive intelligence from vast amounts of data provided by satellites, drones, and other sensors. Anduril offers a mesh-networking product called Lattice for rapid collection and analysis of battlefield data for drone swarming and other operations.\n\nJust a day earlier, Palantir and Shield AI expanded their own partnership to include the deployment of Palantir\u2019s Warp Speed for integrating data into workflow. Their collaboration has sought to integrate Shield AI's autonomous systems with Palantir\u2019s data-processing platforms to provide commanders with a clearer operational picture. Shield AI also competes against Anduril with its autonomous piloting and drone swarm software for GPS-denied environments.\n\nAnduril also has new team-ups with Oracle, whose cloud infrastructure will support Anduril\u2019s autonomous systems to offer real-time data analysis near the battlefield; and with fellow drone maker Archer, to develop hybrid-propulsion aircraft for defense.\n\nFinally, Palantir announced a partnership with longtime defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton to make AI tools for logistics, autonomous systems, and other applications.\n\nCongress gets behind AI firms\n\nOn Wednesday, the House approved a 2025 defense authorization bill that includes several provisions intended to spur military adoption of AI. The bill puts a big emphasis on building out data and cloud computing resources to enable much faster adoption of AI and AI-enabled weapons, areas where companies like Anduril, Palantir, Booz Allen, and Shield AI excel.\n\nOne of the most ambitious is Section 1532, which mandates the expansion of secure, high-performance computing infrastructure to support AI training and development.\n\nThis infrastructure, which will include partnerships with commercial and hybrid cloud providers, is critical for developing scalable AI models capable of adapting to evolving mission requirements.\n\nSection 236 also presses the Pentagon to deepen partnerships with the private sector and academia, building on commercial expertise to accelerate innovation.\n\nThe act also includes stringent reporting requirements intended to ensure accountability and adaptability. From pilot programs in biotechnology to operational testing of cheap, autonomous drones under the Replicator program, the Pentagon must provide regular updates to Congress, demonstrating progress and addressing challenges.\n\n\u201cAnnual updates will assess data resources, cybersecurity measures, and the potential for operational use of technologies,\u201d the legislation says.\n\nThe Pentagon needs to reshape its acquisition philosophies to accommodate software firms, DIU Director Doug Beck said on Saturday. Instead of buying things via program requirements, the Defense Department must give companies more flexibility to design products that might be useful for defense and then bring those to the Pentagon.\n\nThat could be a boon to companies like Anduril, which has found a way to produce and even battlefield-test products before the Defense Department even asks for them.\n\n\u201cIf you give exact definitions and just port more money against it, then\u2026you actually don't incent the kind of behaviors that you want,\u201d Beck said Saturday at the Reagan National Security Forum. \u201cInstead, for those major areas of tech change, we should provide a consistent demand signal of the critical areas we'll be buying in, rather than specific programs, areas like AI, autonomy, space, biotech.\u201d\n\nBeck said the hope is that this approach will induce competition among industry players.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how the emerging partnerships will square with that.\n\nOne Defense Department official, speaking on background, called Anduril and Palantir the \u201csuccess stories of the defense-tech movement.\u201d The official said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the partnerships signaled \u201ca play to shape the next administration\u2019s approach\u201d to buying defense technology.\n\nThat will be even easier under Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar, who has reportedly been picked to lead the Pentagon\u2019s research and engineering efforts under the next administration.\n\nAnduril and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nNew DOD AI cell\n\nWhich agency or office in the Department of Defense will spearhead accountability and governance over players that are increasingly coordinating their approach? That falls to the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, better known for its efforts to foster the use of AI.\n\nJust on Wednesday, the CDAO and the Defense Innovation Unit announced that they had created an AI rapid capabilities cell to accelerate the exploration, testing, and adoption of generative AI.\n\nThe NDAA also pushes the CDAO to smooth the adoption of AI. Section 1521 tasks the office with increasing and synchronizing the use of modern data formats and sharing standards across the department. This includes defining and implementing a strategy to transition from obsolete data formats to modern ones in weapons, command-and-control systems, and sensors.\n\nThose company partnerships announced last week are directly relevant to that\u2014and to Section 233, which requires \u201cthe development of a strategy to invest in advanced technologies, including automated systems and artificial intelligence, to streamline the process of organizing, indexing, and categorizing data.\u201d\n\nCDOA chief Radha Plumb is scheduled to depart in January as the new administration takes over. Her successor will be tasked with implementing those NDAA provisions on data synchronization and strategy development. But they will be overseeing an AI defense contractor community that is increasingly synchronized in their approach to data standards, reporting, and competition.\n\nScott Nover, writing at GZERO Media, called this an incipient \u201cAI military-industrial complex.\u201d\n\nIn November, Palantir passed Lockheed Martin in one closely watched measure: market cap. In a letter to investors that month announcing quarterly revenue, Palantir founder Alex Karp boasted, \u201cA juggernaut is emerging. This is the software century, and we intend to take the entire market.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, Karp and his fellow defense-tech execs are hunting together."

            "article_content": "Recovery to opportunity: Microcaps to benefit from shifting economic winds\n\n2024 saw a shift in performance for microcap companies after two consecutive years of challenging conditions. The S&P/ASX Emerging Companies Index has returned an impressive 27.88% (to 31 October). However, on a 3-year CAGR basis the index is still recovering, with a -2.40% p.a. return compared to +9.25% p.a. from the ASX 50.\n\nMicrocaps are inherently inefficient, with this inefficiency exacerbated by poor market sentiment and lack of interest under a backdrop of continued uncertainty. Nonetheless, we have remained focused on investing in companies capturing market share and demonstrating tangible progress in their fundamental business metrics. Often flying under the radar from the broader market, we have seen increased M&A interest return amongst these growing small and nimble businesses. In light of the more benign economic outlook, large cap peers have continued to use this space as a fertile hunting ground, with increased private equity activity reinforcing the inherent strategic and intrinsic value.\n\nThe recovery over the last 12 months has been driven by moderating inflation and the start of interest rate cutting cycles by major central banks globally. With a more supportive economic backdrop and subsiding uncertainty we have seen (and expect to continue to see) more interest in small and illiquid companies, with capital flowing back into the sector.\n\nLooking forward into 2025, sentiment will no longer remain a hurdle as the risk-reward profile continues to strengthen, benefiting from long-term demand tailwinds. Those able to grow despite economic challenges are poised for continued success.\n\nThe sectors to watch\n\nResources: With the US election now behind us, new policy settlings are going to have a global impact. While Trump\u2019s tariff proposal clearly has uncertain implications for Australia, the imposed China tariffs could see stimulus for housing and infrastructure projects, leading to bolstered demand for resources. While currently underweight resources in the portfolio, we are excited about a strong commodity price environment and the management teams that can take advantage. Metals X (ASX: MLX) is an Australian based Tin miner is well placed to capture attractive pricing in what remains a structurally undersupplied market. Similarly, base metal producer Aurelia Metals (ASX: AMI) will see new ore bodies unlocked and optimisation of their projects in the Cobar region of NSW.\n\nHealthcare: Dermatology business Botanix Pharmaceuticals (ASX: BOT) secured FDA approval for their novel drug to treat hyperhidrosis this year. The commercial launch earmarked for early 2025 will see first sales and prove out the product\u2019s attractive economics. Dimerix (ASX: DXB) is conducting phase 3 trials for a rare kidney disease, with results expected towards the end of the calendar year. With portfolio holdings radiology business Capitol Health (ASX: CAJ) and dentist franchise Pacific Smiles (ASX: PSQ) both receiving takeover overs in 2024, we expect the sector to remain heated as we move into 2025.\n\nIndustrials: We continue to find attractive opportunities in industrials that exhibit robust earnings growth. XRF Scientific (ASX: XRF), a scientific equipment and solutions business, continues to experience sustained demand and market share growth resulting from new product development. Alliance Aviation (ASX: AQZ), which supports blue-chip Australian miners with Fly-In-Fly-Out services, is well poised to benefit from an increased fleet size, while debt levels are falling as cash flow generation ramps. Southern Cross Electrical (ASX: SXE) continues to benefit from large infrastructure work in data centres and battery storage facilities as Australia continues to electrify and decarbonise.\n\nHow we are positioning the portfolio\n\nWe position our portfolio through a long-term lens, seeking confidence in business models that can sustain growth and capture market share in all economic conditions. Diversification remains a critical part of our portfolio construction process, minimising the risks associated within each sector, gaining a broader spectrum of exposure to the end markets and customers in which their goods and services are sold.\n\nSome current holdings that exemplify these traits include:\n\nEureka Group (ASX: EGH) which provides critical housing for Australian pensioners that are unable to afford their own home.\n\nwhich provides critical housing for Australian pensioners that are unable to afford their own home. Saunders International (ASX: SND) , a provider of advanced engineering services in mineral processing, energy markets and key infrastructure projects such as Western Sydney Airport.\n\n, a provider of advanced engineering services in mineral processing, energy markets and key infrastructure projects such as Western Sydney Airport. Generation Development (ASX: GDG) , a diversified financial group with innovative tax efficient investment strategies.\n\n, a diversified financial group with innovative tax efficient investment strategies. Software and consulting company RPM Global (ASX: RUL), a provider of solutions for tier-1 mining companies which is increasing the cadence of its sales pipeline though successful implementation of global agreements.\n\nThe long-term capital growth potential in small and microcap companies is significant. We remain confident in our ability to identify these opportunities as market conditions change and new themes emerge. With an improving macro environment and a more supportive view on the microcap outlook we look forward to a successful 2025.\n\nDiscover microcap potential\n\nJoel Fleming is the Portfolio Manager for the UBS Microcap Fund , a fund which has been managed by Yarra Capital Management since August 2014. The Fund aims to deliver superior returns and long-term capital growth by investing in undervalued, high quality micro-sized companies in their early stages of rapid growth.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Mahindra & Mahindra has surpassed Tata Motors as India\u2019s third-largest carmaker thrice in the second half of 2024 on new launches at a time cooling electric vehicle sales and an ageing line-up have hurt the fortunes of the Tata Group company.\n\nIn August, September, and November, Mahindra, the maker of Thar sport utility vehicle (SUV), cornered 12.64%, 12.64%, and 13.14% share of the nation\u2019s passenger vehicle market, respectively, showed a Mint analysis of the government's vehicle registration data compiled by Fada Research. That surpassed Tata\u2019s 12.26%, 11.53%, and 13.10%, respectively, for those months.\n\nAlso read | Tata Motors looks beyond group to source EV batteries\n\nTata Motors\u2019 market share, driven by the Nexon EV, peaked at just over 14% in March but its performance has since deteriorated as India\u2019s nascent electric vehicle market has been hit by a withdrawal or reduction in Central government subsidies. EVs account for just 2.5% of India\u2019s annual passenger vehicle sales of about 4 million units.\n\nOver reliance on EVs\n\nA few carmakers\u2019 troubles lie partly in its \u201cover-reliance\" on electric vehicles, which is still a nascent segment in India, Gaurav Vangaal, associate director at S&P Mobility, told Mint. The new EV lineup, once an advantage, is now facing setbacks with sales declining demand and increased competition, he said, adding that MG Motor India\u2019s Windsor EV became the nation\u2019s best-selling electric car soon after deliveries began in October, challenging the Tata\u2019s early lead.\n\nMahindra has gained with the success of mainstay SUVs like the Thar Roxx, which has garnered over 1.7 lakh bookings. Attractive pricing of models like the XUV700 also helped it sustain volumes in its current line-up.\n\nFor Tata, the refreshed Nexon has failed to deliver with sales. Moreover, Tata\u2019s Curvv EV\u2014a coupe-style vehicle meant to expand its portfolio\u2014has struggled to find buyers, competing in a similar price band as the Nexon EV and leaving potential customers divided.\n\nAlso read | Mahindra launches maiden ground-up electric vehicles BE 6e and XEV 9e\n\n\u201cCustomers are not ready to adopt coupe-style EVs in significant numbers yet,\" Vangaal said. \u201cBut if Mahindra sees acceptance for such designs in its ground-up EVs, Tata\u2019s Curvv ICE (intenal combustion engine) should gain traction and it will benefit from coupes popularity too.\"\n\nEmailed queries to Tata Motors remained unanswered at the time of going of press.\n\nNalinikanth Gollagunta, chief executive, automotive division, Mahindra, cited new launches and a clear shift in consumer preferences towards vehicles with advanced features, cutting-edge technology, and improved safety for the demand for the company's premium SUVs. \u201c75% of XUV700 sales today is for our top variants AX7/AX7L,\" he said in an emailed response.\n\nNo new launches\n\nTata Motors lacks a significant new launch until mid-2025, when its Sierra EV is expected to debut.\n\n\u201cThis year they also saved some share because of their new CNG offerings, but CNG volumes are also disappearing now,\" a Tata Motors dealer told Mint on condition of anonymity out of business concerns. \u201cWith Mahindra's Thar Roxx and MG's Windsor production picking up pace next year, Tata will need to tap into a strategy to bring in incremental volumes. It needs a new model to bring in excitement after the brand's popularity picked in the phase just after Covid-19.\"\n\nTata Motors' fleet sales, accounting for 20% of its total EV sales, also stalled because of disruptions in EV policies of states like Delhi.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra, on the other hand, has capitalized on its dominance in the SUV category. Its market share climbed from just over 10% in January to 13.14% in November, reflecting steady gains even as Tata faltered. Mahindra plans to further bolster its lineup with battery electric vehicle deliveries slated for 2025.\n\nThe SUV segment has seen grown strong which is currently at about 65% of the passenger vehicle market from about 30% 5-6 years ago, Gollagunta said in his response. Mahindra is optimistic about sustaining the momentum due to a strong product pipeline, including nine new ICE SUVs and seven EVs planned by 2030, he said. These include the XUV 3XO and the Thar ROXX.\n\nMoreover, Gollagunta, said \u201cour product line-up is fresh in terms of age of the product, with most of the products launched in the last 3-4 years\".\n\nAgeing ICE lineup\n\nTata Motors, however, is also grappling with an ageing ICE lineup. Its A-segment models, introduced nearly a decade ago, haven\u2019t seen major updates, allowing Mahindra, Hyundai Motor India, Kia India and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. to dominate the market.\n\nWith Nexon EV sales plateauing and the Curvv yet to gain traction, Tata\u2019s prospects hinge on its upcoming launches but will run into competition from its rivals that also plan new models next year.\n\nTata Motors' volumes were driven by Nexon and Punch taking the mantle. \u201cWhile the Punch is continuing to do well, the Nexon after the refresh hasn't done as well,\" an automotive industry analyst told Mint on condition of anonymity. \u201cMoreover, (Mahindra\u2019s) XUV700 volumes have gone up from 6,000 units to 9,000 volumes a month after their price intervention, but the Safari and Harrier didn't respond much to Tata's price intervention,\" the analyst said, referring to price cuts.\n\n\u201cI don't see it reversing in the next 6-8 months fully unless the first-time buyer in the hatch and compact segment comes back,\" he said."

            "article_content": "The Organised Private Sector has joined the call on the Central Bank of Nigeria to address the cash scarcity witnessed nationwide, stressing that the country is not developed enough for cashless transactions.\n\nMembers of the OPS pointed out that the scarcity of cash has adversely affected businesses, especially those in the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises category, as they expressed fears of an imminent collapse of MSMEs.\n\n\u201cWhile the intent may have been to modernise the financial system and promote cashless transactions, the reality is that these policies have inadvertently stiffened business operations across the country,\u201d the National Vice President of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, Segun Kuti-George, said.\n\nKuti-George noted, \u201cNigeria\u2019s economy is not yet developed enough to function effectively on a predominantly cashless basis. A significant portion of the population still relies heavily on cash for daily transactions.\n\n\u201cWhile the cash scarcity has encouraged some adoption of electronic payment methods, it is not sufficient to address the broader economic needs. The adverse impact on businesses and individuals remains severe.\u201d\n\nHe explained that even in advanced economies like the United States and European nations, cash remains an accessible option.\n\n\u201cThis is supported by higher levels of financial literacy and efficient systems for online transactions. In Canada, for instance, one can withdraw up to $1,500 in a single ATM transaction. Comparatively, Nigeria\u2019s withdrawal limit of N20,000 (approximately $26) per transaction is impractical and reflects a lack of consideration for the needs of businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cThese restrictions undermine the economy and highlight systemic challenges in understanding and implementing policies that align with the realities of the population. A more balanced approach is needed, one that gradually transitions the economy towards cashless transactions without disrupting livelihoods or stifling business growth.\n\n\u201cThe path forward should involve greater financial inclusion, improved infrastructure for electronic payments, and policy adjustments that reflect the economic realities of Nigeria\u2019s diverse population.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the National President of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Dr Femi Egbesola, said the naira scarcity hurts the macro, micro, and small businesses that are largely cash-dependent.\n\nHe said, \u201cMany in this sector sell small-sized products for as low as N50, N100, and N200 that are wholly transacted with cash. Many of these businesses now find it hard to survive with the cash crunch. Another negative outcome of the scarcity is that it discourages small business owners from banking, thereby reducing financial inclusion and increasing financial insecurity associated with carrying cash.\n\n\u201cSome have resorted to buying cash from POS operators at higher costs, resulting either in depleting their profits or leading to increasing the prices of their wares, and this eventually leads to low sales. The majority of the MSMEs still operate in the informal sector and as such are largely dependent on cash transactions.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent then, that CBN responds swiftly to arrest this anomaly before it impedes more negatively on micro and small businesses to the extent of extinction of a substantial fraction of the sector. Hence, if not arrested fast, the wholesale negative effects would become very pronounced on the economy soon.\u201d\n\nThe Director of the Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, told The PUNCH that the present cash scarcity risks a slowdown of business activities in the country.\n\nYusuf explained that the cash scarcity was particularly not good for Nigeria\u2019s highly informal sector, saying \u201cThe major effects of the cash scarcity on business is that it slows down the velocity and the volume of business transactions, especially at the informal sector level and micro-enterprise level in our rural areas because these are segments of the economy that uses a lot of cash.\n\n\u201cIn the cities, I imagine that the use of electronic payments is very high for retail transactions. But in many of our rural areas, the use of cash is huge.\n\nThe CPPE president cautioned against the dangers of cash flow disruption, adding \u201cSince cash is a means of payment, once there is a disruption in the flow of cash, it affects the payment system and therefore affects the flow and the velocity of transactions.\n\n\u201cEconomic activities are affected and that is not good for any economy. (This is) because you want economic activities to be seamless and you need a very efficient payment system to make that happen. And cash, of course, is a means of payment. So that is the negative effect it has on the economy.\u201d\n\nYusuf also outlined factors worsening the cash scarcity crisis, including low financial inclusion and lowered trust in commercial banks, noting \u201cThere is also the issue of low level of financial inclusion. Even though we have made progress in that, I must confess that there is still a lot more to do.\n\n\u201cThen lately there has been a breach of confidence, if I may put it that way, concerning some online transactions because of the failure of some of the banks\u2019 apps which affected quite many people and created a trust problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the economist, the use of online transactions or electronic payment systems is a function of trust.\n\nHe explained further: \u201cSo if anything happens to undermine that trust, a lot of people may stay away from it. There are quite many people who are yet to recover from the disruptions that happened about a month ago with some of the major banks concerning the electronic payment system.\n\n\u201cOnce people have one experience, because of that, they may shy away completely from the use of online transactions and decide to go purely for cash.\u201d\n\nYusuf stressed the importance of maintaining the trust customers have in banks to dispense cash as well as improving literacy in cash-heavy rural areas.\n\nHe emphasised, \u201cThe ability to continue to sustain the confidence of citizens in the payment system is extremely very important. Because once anything goes wrong, it has a far-reaching implication for the use of online payments. And once that happens, a lot of people will move to the use of cash.\n\n\u201cThen there is also the level of literacy. The level of literacy is still very low largely in our rural areas. And that affects the enthusiasm about the use of online transactions. So such people prefer and are more confident with the use of cash.\u201d\n\nFurther, the CPPE director pointed out the negative impact of money laundering on cash scarcity, remarking, \u201cThere is the problem of money laundering. A lot of corruption activities are done in cash which could also affect the demand for cash and if the total supply has not increased, then there may be scarcity.\n\nYusuf added that the business model of Point of Sale operators which presently competes with commercial banks for cash is a net negative for sufficient cash circulation in the economy.\n\nThe economist noted that there were over three million POS operators in the economy who \u201cRather than wait for depositors to bring cash to them like the banks would do, go to retail outlets to buy cash.\n\n\u201cSo cash is not flowing to the banking system as it used to, because the banks now have a major competitor in the POS operators.\u201d\n\nThe economist acknowledged a higher percentage of cash resided with the POS operators who do business with them.\n\n\u201cThey buy the cash and they dispense cash at a commission,\u201d Yusuf asserted. \u201cThat (POS business) has added a completely new dimension to the dynamics around cash management and cash availability in the economy. Because as of October, for instance, we had cash currency in circulation, I\u2019m talking of currency outside the banking system of about N4.3tn.\u201d\n\nYusuf exclaimed that with N4.3tn in circulation, there should be sufficient cash but for the drop in confidence, money laundering issues, and emerging money-buying POS business.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH, the Director-General of the Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association, Mr Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, described the cash scarcity in Nigeria as a double-edged sword.\n\nOyerinde noted that while it could accelerate the shift towards a cashless economy, it poses significant challenges for micro, small, and medium enterprises and the informal sector, which heavily rely on cash transactions for their daily operations.\n\nAccording to Oyerinde, \u201cThe current cash scarcity is a double-edged sword. While it could foster a faster evolution of the much-touted cashless economy, it also portends a great challenge to MSMEs and the informal sector.\u201d\n\nHe added that balancing this transition is critical to ensuring inclusive growth and economic stability.\n\nWhile decrying the devaluation of the naira, the President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture, Dele Oye, said the lack of confidence in the naira was part of its scarcity.\n\nHe said, \u201cNobody is holding naira, everybody is holding a dollar, this is why nobody goes to the bank to withdraw naira because they put all their money in dollars. This is why the naira has to become stabilised. If it continues to appreciate, that is fine. However, the Central Bank of Nigeria has not told us the fundamentals of why we should trust the naira. Until they carry us along, we cannot know what is happening.\n\n\u201cThe CBN is not engaging stakeholders, it may be the end of the year if they want to show that they have performed. The Central Bank of Nigeria needs to engage and listen more to the stakeholders. They should not only listen to the banks or talk to the banks, they need to also talk to people who utilise those banks, like what are our impressions of the services? How do their monetary policies affect us? This lack of stakeholder engagement is a big problem.\n\nOye explained that the consequence is for investors to invest in other countries due to the lack of uncertainty in Nigeria.\n\nCBN fines banks\n\nThe CBN is making efforts to tackle the cash scarcity, as it announced a fine of N150m per branch on Deposit Money Banks found guilty of facilitating the illegal flow of mint naira notes to currency hawkers and unscrupulous agents.\n\nThe apex bank disclosed this in a circular issued on December 13, 2024, signed by the acting Director of the Currency Operations Department, Mohammed Olayemi.\n\nThe circular revealed that the CBN is concerned about the increasing prevalence of mint naira notes being traded by hawkers, a practice the bank described as impeding efficient and effective cash distribution to customers and the general public.\n\nThe circular, which referred to an earlier directive dated November 13, 2024, highlighted the apex bank\u2019s determination to address the commodification of the naira.\n\nUnder the directive, any branch of a financial institution found culpable will face a penalty of N150m for the first violation.\n\nSubsequent infractions, the CBN warned, would attract stricter sanctions under the provisions of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act 2020.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the apex bank stated that it would increase periodic spot checks in banking halls and ATMs while deploying mystery shoppers to uncover illicit cash hawking spots across the country.\n\nThe PUNCH earlier reported that the CBN issued a stern warning to Deposit Money Banks over cash hoarding and diversion, stating that such actions will attract stiff penalties.\n\nIn a circular dated November 13, 2024, signed by the Acting Director of Currency Operations, Muhammad Olayemi, and released by the CBN, the apex bank announced intensified measures to ensure efficient and transparent cash disbursement.\n\nThe CBN reminded banks of its ongoing mystery shopping exercises and spot checks aimed at discouraging the abuse of naira notes and ensuring responsible distribution of cash, especially as the festive season approaches.\n\nAccording to the circular, the initiatives are designed to prevent the flow of newly minted banknotes to hawkers and support efficient cash disbursement to the public.\n\nThe central bank stated that any DMB traced to seized cash from unauthorised hawkers would face financial penalties.\n\nSuch banks will be fined 10 per cent of the total value of cash withdrawn from the CBN on the day the offence was committed. Repeat offenders will incur an additional five per cent penalty for each subsequent breach.\n\nThe CBN also warned against cash hoarding, diversion, and other practices that hinder cash flow, stressing that such actions violate the Clean Note Policy. It noted that defaulters would face appropriate sanctions, which may include additional fines or other regulatory actions."

            "article_content": "The environmental and social impact assessments for the Rogun project are outdated and do not consider the advancements in renewable energy technologies or the increased risks of climate change.\n\nBuilding the Rogun Dam to its maximum height would be an economic and environmental disaster for Tajikistan and the region.\n\nBuilding the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan to its maximum projected height and specifications would be an economic disaster for Central Asia\u2019s poorest nation, and an environmental nightmare for the entire region, according to a newly published expert report. The advent of new technologies for electricity generation means that Tajikistan\u2019s already decades-old mega project would be outdated before it became fully operational.\n\nThe report, compiled by the Kazakhstan-based environmental organization Rivers Without Boundaries, is being distributed shortly before a World Bank Board of Directors meeting, scheduled for December 17, is due to discuss financing options for the Rogun project, the costs of which have spiraled upward in recent years. Current projections put the price tag of completing the dam at its projected height of 335 meters at $6.4 billion.\n\nThe project was first conceived in the 1970s and revived by the Tajik government in 2016. Work has continued on the dam sporadically since then.\n\nExperts assembled by Rivers Without Boundaries compiled data on eight different scenarios for achieving the Rogun project\u2019s intended goal of producing enough electricity to both meet the country\u2019s domestic needs and generate revenue via the export of power. The results contained in the report suggest that a mix of renewable power generation, along with the completion of a significantly smaller Rogun Dam, would be the optimal solution.\n\n\u201cOur preliminary calculations of alternative scenarios for project implementation show the combination of solar generation development with the completion of Rogun HPP with a smaller dam may make it possible to fully cover the winter energy deficit in Tajikistan by 2030-2031,\u201d the report states. The \u201cdiversification of energy sources within the unified energy system of the country will also significantly reduce climate change risks for the energy sector and the economy.\u201d\n\nThe environmental and social impact assessments that officials are relying on for the Rogun project are outdated, relying on over decade-old data, according to the report. Since then, there have been major advances in wind and solar power generation technologies, and the risks posed by global warming in Central Asia have risen. \u201cOne of the recurrent planning mistakes made each time this project has been revived and reviewed is the lack of assessment of alternative solutions to the project's challenges,\u201d the report states.\n\nWhen completed the 335-meter-tall dam would have an annual power-generating capacity of 3,600 megawatts, roughly equivalent to the output of three nuclear plants. But by the time the facility can reach full generating capacity, the cost of its electricity would be uncompetitive compared to renewable sources, the report asserted. The unit cost of building Rogun is up to four times higher than that of a solar power plant (SPP).\n\n\u201cThe cost of Rogun's electricity will be more expensive than that produced by solar photovoltaics (SPP) and wind (WPP) power plants. If Tajikistan intends to become an electricity exporter to its neighbors, it needs to develop SPP and WPP,\u201d the report adds.\n\nA new environmental impact study, along with a comprehensive regional water-usage framework, is needed, before any additional financing for Rogun is allocated, Rivers Without Boundaries argues. Environmentalists say the alteration of the water flows of the Vaksh and Amu Darya rivers caused by Rogun construction and operation to date already has degraded regional ecosystems, and \u201cworsened conditions for irrigation in dry years.\u201d\n\nRogun would also be a potent source of greenhouse gasses at a time when Central Asia is straining to curtail emissions as part of an effort to slow global warming. The draft environmental impact assessment currently in use shows that Rogun will \u201cstill have a large carbon footprint,\u201d the report states. \u201c The completion of the Rogun HPP with the highest dam [335-meter level] will not only fail to result in rapid decarbonization of Central Asian energy systems, but rather, on the contrary, will slow down this process.\u201d\n\nBy Eurasianet.org\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

            "article_content": "8.6 / 10\n\nSCORE Origin Eon17-X v2 $3,568 at Origin PC Pros Beautiful 4K display with DCI-P3 support looks sharp and saturated\n\nIncredible general and gaming performance\n\nRGB keyboard paired with a gigantic trackpad feels great to use Cons 17.3-inch laptop is extremely heavy\n\nFan noise is distractingly loud\n\nDisplay is great but not an OLED\n\nIf you want the best gaming laptop you can buy, then you must be ready to subject your wallet to some horrors. Your ears, too, in the case of the Origin PC Eon17-X v2. This formidable gaming machine costs a fortune and demands headphones, thanks to its very loud (though very capable) fans that start blasting air over its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU even before your favorite game's introductory cutscene gets a chance to load.\n\nAt more than $3,500 after a substantial discount, the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 is one of the more expensive gaming laptops we've tested recently, but it's not the fastest. The Alienware M18 R2 still holds that title, but the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 still offers plenty of 3D muscle -- and it has the better display of the two in the form of a 4K, 144Hz panel.\n\nIf you build the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 to the exact specs of the Alienware M18 R2 we tested, it costs about $250 more, which is a reasonable sum for the superior display. Alienware's 18-inch monster is still the one to beat in terms of raw performance, but the Origin's 4K display is super sharp and saturated, and the laptop can easily dish out triple-digit frame rates for today's demanding titles at their highest quality settings.\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 Price as reviewed $3,568 Display size/resolution 17.3-inch 3,840x2,160 144Hz IPS LCD CPU Intel Core i9-14900HX Memory 64GB LPDDR5-4800 Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Storage Two, 2TB SSD Ports Thunderbolt 5 (x2), USB-C 3.2 Gen1, USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (x2), HDMI 2.1, Mini DisplayPort 1.4, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, combo audio Networking Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Operating system Windows 11 Home 24H2 Weight 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg)\n\nConfiguration options are plentiful\n\nSince Origin is a boutique PC builder, its laptops are customizable, and it gives you a good amount of leeway to adjust your system to your exact needs and budget -- and you can really push the limit for the latter. The Eon17-X v2 laptop we reviewed costs an eye-opening $3,568, and that's after Origin's $700 discount. But the system builder doesn't slouch on parts; you're getting some of the best components you can stuff into a 17-inch gaming behemoth.\n\nOur laptop came with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, which has a whopping 24 cores and 32 threads and runs at 2.2GHz by default (with its turbo clock boost maxing out at 5.8GHz). The CPU is paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, which ensures that even opening a web browser has a decent chance of making the laptop sound like a passenger jet at takeoff.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOur test system also included a near-overkill 64GB of DDR5-4800 memory and 4 terabytes of storage (split across two 2TB SSDs). That's the most memory offered, but far from the most storage, with 4TB and 8TB drives also available and three total M.2 slots.\n\nYou can choose from one of two 17.3-inch displays: a 2,560x1,440-pixel panel with a 240Hz refresh rate or a 3,840x2,160, 144Hz screen. The former locks you into an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, whereas the latter is the only option for the faster RTX 4090 GPU. We received the latter. It's a better setup, but it'll cost you an extra $523 from the laptop's base configuration.\n\nOrigin also offers custom UV prints for the top of the laptop, a $30 upgrade that's nice to have if one of the 19 designs really catches your eye. You can also send in your own custom art to print, but that's a $140 charge. This level of customization isn't offered by a more conventional manufacturer like Dell, but I'd recommend going with a lighter print than a darker one. The Starfield print on the laptop I reviewed looked quite a bit murkier in person compared with the bright, beautiful image on Origin's site.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 performance\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 is a beast in size and performance. Across the board, it delivered scores and frame rates on our benchmarks that were competitive with the highest-performing laptops we've tested, the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16, each of which features the same CPU/GPU duo in the Core i9-14900HX and RTX 4090.\n\nOn Geekbench 6, the Eon17-X v2 put out single- and multicore scores that were in line with those of the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16. It had the fastest single-core score of the three, and its multicore score was 4% slower than the Alienware M18 R2's. It fell back a bit on our Cinebench 2024 tests, especially on the multicore CPU test, where it was 33% slower than the Alienware M18 R2.\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 performed well on our 3D graphics and gaming tests, but it still trailed the Alienware and Razer. I checked to make sure thermal throttling wasn't to blame for the Origin's consistent third-place finishes of this trio since all three laptops share the same CPU and GPU configuration. When I repeated our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark back to back to back, the average temperature of the laptop's CPU and GPU was under 80 degrees Celsius the entire time, which I expected given how much fan noise the laptop puts out. That's a great reading, since you may start to experience performance drops as you inch closer to triple-digits.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nBig, bulky and beautiful\n\nThe Origin Eon17-X v2 is not the laptop to buy for your daily commute, both due to its weight (7.5 pounds) and the fact that you'll enrage everyone on your train or subway with its noise once you fire up a game. It's a great desk companion that feels incredibly sturdy and solid to use, and its 17.3-inch display is big enough to make your games feel immersive and fun.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe huge footprint, including a near-1-inch thickness, provides plenty of room for both a regular keyboard and numpad. While they're centered on the laptop's palm rest, the laptop's gigantic touchpad (at 6 inches wide by just over 3.5 inches tall) is centered below the regular keyboard. This feels slightly awkward, as your left hand is a bit cramped for space when you rest it on the lower-left side of the laptop's palm rest, whereas your right has plenty of room. And this design puts your hands slightly off-center from the screen, which feels a little wonky.\n\nThe keys themselves are incredibly comfortable to type on, with great travel (and resistance) for everything from casual gaming to first-person shooters. They light up, too, but you have to use Origin's Control Center app to manage your look; you can't adjust the colors using Function key shortcuts, including their brightness. It's a bit annoying to have to launch an app when you want to make modifications on the fly, and while the app lets you change the backlight color of any individual key or pick from one of nine preset effects that apply to all your keys at once, it's not as comprehensive as what you might get with most gaming keyboards.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nParent company Corsair and its iCUE software allows for a lot more creativity, but that doesn't work on Origin's laptop. With Origin's Control Center, you can't, for example, create your own effects or patterns, set up reactive lighting for games, or import color profiles.\n\nThe laptop's touchpad, though huge, is much more responsive toward its bottom than its top. You really have to push to register a click within an inch of the touchpad's top, which is annoying but not uncommon on a mechanical touchpad. I dislike that the laptop's arrow keys -- typically critical for gaming -- bleed right into its numpad. It's an awkward design to have the right arrow sit directly below the laptop's 1 key, and I question the usefulness of the numpad, in general, on a gaming laptop.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nI was slightly concerned that the laptop's vents, located on the upper half of its left and right sides, would cause some unpleasant hand-warming during game sessions. My fears were unfounded; the laptop's loud cooling system is nothing if not effective. Fan noise may be ever-present and thunderous, but I had no issues gaming on a couch. It's much more comfortable, however, to plop the heavy laptop on a desk than on your lap.\n\nMinor shortcomings aside, the Eon17-X v2 is built like a tank. Its downward-facing speakers, which sit on the laptop's bottom (closest to your lap), sound decent, with bass ever-so-slightly better than the meh quality most laptops dish out. They give you a pleasant, enveloping sound when you're checking out an errant TikTok or YouTube video, but there's absolutely no way you're going to use these for gaming. You're going to need to budget for a headset, possibly even noise-canceling, with this beast.\n\nMassive 17-inch 4K display\n\nThe 17.3-inch display isn't an OLED, which is a letdown, given the laptop's price and noteworthy specs, but having a huge, gorgeous 4K display is nothing to be sad about. The display -- presumably IPS, though Origin doesn't detail this anywhere -- supports both the DCI-P3 and regular sRGB color spaces. Though folks who prefer color accuracy above all else might not care for the overly saturated look of DCI-P3, it makes games, movies and pictures absolutely pop. Unfortunately, the display doesn't support HDR, so you don't get those superrich scenes and dark-as-night black levels you might otherwise find on your living-room TV.\n\nThe laptop's white levels hit 30 nits at its lowest brightness setting and an impressive 556 nits at its highest. You should have few, if any, issues seeing the screen in daylight, even if you're unlikely to commute with it because of its heft. The minimum luminance is right in the sweet spot: not too dim to look bad but not too bright to cause annoyance to those who are particularly sensitive when staring at screens all day long.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe laptop's 4K resolution is a great fit for its humongous screen, making everything look sharp and crisp. I had as much fun (as one possibly can) mucking around in spreadsheets and Google Docs as I did gaming on the Eon17-X v2, and I would absolutely use this laptop as my daily driver -- just at my desk, not carried around my house.\n\nTo that point, it's also great that the laptop, big as it is, comes with a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity (supporting 160Hz-wide wireless channels for those of you living far away from any neighbors). I don't foresee moving it around very much, so it's great that you can hardwire yourself into blazing speeds on your home network, especially if you're rocking a higher-than-gigabit setup. The rest of the laptop's ports cover all the bases, from USB-A and USB-C to HDMI and DisplayPort -- no issues there. The most noteworthy inclusion among the ports are the two USB-C ports that offer the latest Thunderbolt 5 connectivity.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nIs the Origin Eon17-X v2 gaming laptop worth it?\n\nMy only qualm with the Eon17-X v2 is that it's very expensive for the performance it delivers. If you build Alienware's M18 R2 with the same specs as this Origin laptop, you're already saving around $250 (limited-time discounts notwithstanding) for a system that's a step faster for gaming by a not-so-insignificant amount (though it lacks a 4K screen). Match an Eon17-X v2 configuration to the M18 R2 that we reviewed, and it's the same deal: Origin's system costs around $250 more, but you get a much better, if slightly smaller, display.\n\nIf all you care about are frame rates, Alienware's M18 R2 remains the gaming laptop to beat. But for an overall experience, especially when you can find it on sale, Origin's Eon17-X v2 wins out for its superior display and slightly better customizability when you're building the laptop to begin with. Resist the urge to configure more laptop than you really need, and it's worth the extra cost you'll pay for everyday use.\n\nHide our expert take Photo Gallery 1/1 How we test computers Photo Gallery 1/1 The review process for laptops, desktops, tablets and other computerlike devices consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our expert reviewers.

            "article_content": "To capitalise on this potential, companies should assess their current technology stack and identify B2B functionality gaps\n\nIndia's online B2B marketplaces have the potential to reach $200 Bn by 2030\n\nIndian businesses seeking growth beyond traditional methods are increasingly adopting B2B marketplace models. This approach offers expansion opportunities without the risks associated with conventional strategies. For executives and technology leaders aiming to implement or refine a B2B marketplace, grasping the nuances of this model is paramount.\n\nIndia\u2019s online B2B marketplaces have the potential to reach $200 Bn by 2030, based on the latest projections from the Economic Diplomacy Division of IndBiz. This growth stems from key technological advancements reshaping B2B interactions. As India progresses with its Digital India initiative, B2B marketplaces will play an increasingly significant role in the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nTechnological Foundations For B2B Marketplaces\n\nAPI-first architecture stands at the forefront, enabling seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. This approach creates a unified ecosystem where data moves effortlessly between the marketplace, ERP systems, CRMs, and other mission-critical software.\n\nMicroservices architecture complements this shift, allowing businesses to adapt swiftly to market changes and scale functionalities independently.\n\nAdvanced marketplaces often rely on cloud-native solutions to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and reliability. This is particularly relevant for B2B platforms handling high transaction volumes and intricate business logic. Cloud infrastructure facilitates the implementation of AI and machine learning technologies, which are increasingly applied to predictive analytics in inventory management, product recommendations, and fraud detection.\n\nEmerging trends such as blockchain integration for supply chain transparency, IoT devices for real-time inventory tracking, and voice-activated ordering systems for hands-free procurement are set to further advance the B2B landscape.\n\nKey Features Driving B2B Excellence\n\nModern B2B marketplaces require sophisticated features to meet complex buyer and seller needs. A multi-tier pricing engine is indispensable, accommodating customer-specific pricing, volume-based discounts, and market-driven dynamic pricing. This pricing flexibility allows businesses to remain competitive while maintaining profitability.\n\nConfigurable approval workflows are equally significant. B2B transactions often involve multiple stakeholders and intricate approval processes. Implementing role-based access control with customisable approval chains allows marketplaces to align with clients\u2019 organisational structures, streamlining operations and reducing purchase friction.\n\nThe efficacy of a B2B marketplace hinges on its ability to help buyers locate products efficiently. This necessitates an advanced search and filtering system with faceted search capabilities, custom attributes, and technical specification filters.\n\nIn the B2B sector, where purchases are often highly specific and technical, the ability to pinpoint exact product specifications significantly impacts user satisfaction and conversion rates.\n\nA comprehensive quote management system is another critical feature. The capability to handle requests for quotes (RFQs) with integrated negotiation tools and CRM system connectivity can significantly improve the sales process. This is particularly relevant in industries with complex, customised products or services where standard pricing may not apply.\n\nReal-time inventory visibility across multiple warehouses or suppliers is indispensable. In B2B transactions, where large orders and just-in-time delivery are common, accurate inventory information is critical. Advanced systems should support backorder and pre-order management, providing businesses with the flexibility to meet varied customer requirements.\n\nBest Practices And Considerations\n\nImplementing these advanced features requires adherence to proven best practices. Data migration and cleansing is a critical process often underestimated in its complexity. A comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is necessary to ensure consistent data across the marketplace, particularly when consolidating information from multiple legacy systems or integrating various supplier databases.\n\nPerformance optimisation significantly impacts success. Employing caching strategies, content delivery networks (CDNs), and lazy loading techniques ensures swift page loads, even for extensive product catalogues.\n\nIn B2B transactions, where buyers often review detailed technical specifications, performance directly influences user satisfaction and sales outcomes.\n\nThe increasing trend of mobile usage in B2B transactions, particularly in the Indian market, cannot be overlooked. A mobile-first approach using responsive design and progressive enhancement techniques is necessary to cater to B2B buyers who prefer mobile transactions.\n\nLocalisation is a critical consideration, especially in India\u2019s diverse market. Supporting multiple languages and currencies is fundamental. Adherence to regional tax regulations, such as India\u2019s GST system, is crucial for compliance and building user trust.\n\nB2B marketplaces require stringent security measures due to high-value transactions and sensitive data. Multi-factor authentication, SSL encryption, and regular security audits should be standard. In an era of increasing cyber threats, demonstrating a strong commitment to security can be a significant differentiator in the B2B space.\n\nReal-World Applications And Future Outlook\n\nB2B marketplace implementations have yielded impressive results across various industries. In the food distribution sector, companies have successfully digitalised their B2B operations by developing specialised platforms for different customer segments.\n\nBy implementing flexible pricing systems and integrating with existing ERPs, these businesses have achieved round-the-clock order placement capabilities, reduced operational costs, and expanded their customer bases.\n\nIn the wholesale distribution space, companies have optimised operations by creating self-service portals with custom catalogues and pricing. Automating quote-to-order processes and implementing advanced analytics for personalised product recommendations has led to significant reductions in order processing times and increases in average order values.\n\nA prime example of the transformative power of B2B marketplaces comes from one of our customers, a food distribution company in Europe. They have highlighted two major benefits of shifting to B2B online ordering:\n\nReduced Cost Per Order : B2B businesses are encouraged to calculate their cost per order, factoring in all necessary expenses such as agents, devices, petrol, and consumables. They proudly report that they have decreased their cost per order by over 50% through the implementation of their B2B marketplace. Impact On Average Order Value (AOV) And Product Quantity : A positive outcome identified is that customers, when presented with a digital catalog, are discovering and ordering from more product categories compared to traditional ordering methods. This contrasts with the tendency of sales agents to focus on replenishing products that customers typically buy.\n\nFurthermore, owning the digital customer relationship has emerged as a key factor in the B2B marketplace model. The customer data gathered through these platforms is an invaluable asset. For instance, owning a network of 50,000 restaurant customers can drive significant GMV growth in a marketplace model as the category offer expands.\n\nThis is because customers tend to consolidate their ordering processes, preferring to use a single platform for multiple product categories.\n\nThe B2B marketplace model presents a significant opportunity for Indian businesses to overcome growth constraints and expand their reach. To capitalise on this potential, companies should assess their current technology stack and identify B2B functionality gaps. Selecting technology partners with proven expertise in B2B marketplace development is crucial for successful implementation.\n\nA phased implementation plan, beginning with core B2B features and gradually expanding, can help manage the transition\u2019s complexity. Investing in staff training and change management is crucial to ensure smooth adoption of the new B2B platform. Ongoing feedback collection from B2B buyers and sellers should inform continuous improvements to the marketplace.\n\nThe advanced B2B marketplace model represents a transformative opportunity for Indian businesses. By embracing these sophisticated digital platforms, companies can position themselves at the forefront of India\u2019s digital commerce sector, driving growth, efficiency, and innovation in the B2B arena.\n\nThe current moment presents an opportune time to act \u2013 businesses that swiftly adopt and optimise B2B marketplace strategies will be well-positioned to thrive in tomorrow\u2019s digital economy, leveraging reduced costs per order, increased AOV, and the invaluable asset of customer data ownership."

            "article_content": "A woman made a 'mind blowing' revelation about UK number plates that left her - and countless others - stunned.\n\nWhile most drivers might view registration plates as little more than a jumble of letters and numbers, it turns out they hold a lot more information than meets the eye.\n\nCourtney Wright, a mum and TikTok user posting under the handle @courtneywrightxxx, shared her discovery in a viral clip, admitting that she was shocked to learn what the letters on car's number plates really mean.\n\n\"I've just learnt something new this morning. I actually can't believe it,\" she said in the video. \"Apparently, the first two letters on your number plate - so, like, my old car was MV - mean that car was registered in Manchester.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They all have different codes, so it goes from MA to M- whatever, and that's all from Manchester.\"\n\nCourtney went on to explain: \"The first two letters actually mean something. You've got where the car was registered, the year it was registered, and then just a random sequence. I'm literally mind blown.\"\n\nHer video has since sparked a flurry of comments, with other people either sharing her amazement or confessing they had no idea about the system themselves.\n\nOne user wrote: \"How did I not know this? Mind blown too,\" while another joked: \"I've been driving for years, and this just made me feel like I missed an entire class on life.\"\n\nWhat do UK number plates actually mean?\n\nIf you've ever wondered about the seemingly random assortment of characters on UK number plates, Jon Kirkbright, the sales director of Private Number Plates, broke it down.\n\nAdvert\n\nCourtney shared her discover with TikTok (TikTok/@courtneywrightxxx)\n\nSpeaking to Diamond Advanced Motorists last year, Jon said: \"To the untrained eye, number plates may look like a random combination of letters and numbers.\n\n\"While many people are aware that the numbers indicate the year the car was made and registered, fewer people realise that the letters better them serve as 'regional identifiers.' These refer to the DVLA office where the car was registered.\"\n\nFor instance, plates beginning with MV, MA, or MB originate from the Manchester and Merseyside region, LA, LB, LV, etc., are assigned to London and BA, BB and BC indicate registration in Birmingham.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This may be why your number plates start with the same letters if you buy more than one car from the same dealership - it's not just a coincidence,\" Jon added.\n\nWhat are the rules around private plates?\n\nFor those with private plates, the rules are a little stricter. Jon highlighted that while it's legal to make a car seem older using a dateless plate, it's illegal to make it look newer.\n\nEach car's number plate are assigned to where the car was registered (Getty stock image)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"For example, you cannot put an '11' number plate on a car registered in 2007,\" he said. \"It is an offence to misrepresent the registration in any way.\"\n\nThose wanting to hide the age of their car often opt for dateless plates, which allow for complete customisation while avoiding this issue.\n\nIf you're curious about your own car's registration, you can find a full list of regional number plate identifiers online - and join the ranks of those whose minds have been well and truly blown by the hidden meaning behind UK plates."

            "article_content": "A swarm of drones lighting up the night sky over the US East Coast has ignited a firestorm of speculation, with conspiracy theorists racing to the forefront with wild claims of government plots, alien invasions, and military cover-ups.The sightings, which began on Nov. 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, have now spread across six states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia, leaving a trail of confusion and fear.While federal agencies, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, have dismissed these incidents as non-threatening to national security or public safety, the internet is abuzz with more outlandish explanations.Comedian Roseanne Barr is among the most vocal, connecting the mysterious drones to a decades-old conspiracy theory known as Project Blue Beam .This theory, popularized by Infowars founder Alex Jones, suggests that the government is preparing to stage a fake alien invasion as a means to control the population through mass panic and authoritarian rule. Barr believes the drone sightings mark the beginning of this staged event.\"Now you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast,\" Barr tweeted on Saturday, fanning the flames of paranoia.Jones, known for championing conspiracy theories, gave his endorsement to Project Blue Beam last week during an interview with ufologist Dr Steven Greer. Greer, a retired physician, voiced his concerns over the alleged plans of global elites, claiming they want to control the world through crises like a fabricated alien invasion.\u201cThey all have this agenda to want to control the world through one calamity after the other, and the big one they\u2019ve been planning is the hoax of an alien threat from outer space,\u201d Greer warned on the Infowars show.Meanwhile, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, no stranger to controversial statements, has also weighed in on the mysterious drones, accusing the government of withholding the truth. On Saturday, Greene posted her belief that the drones are being controlled by the government, hiding the real purpose of their presence.\u201cThe government is in control of the drones and refuses to tell the American people what is going on. It really is that bad,\u201d Greene wrote on X (formerly Twitter).In another post, Greene lent her support to a theory suggesting that the drones might be part of a military training program, possibly designed for future drone warfare. \"However, the government needs to come clean and tell the American people what is going on. That\u2019s the most infuriating part to me,\u201d Greene added.Theories of extraterrestrial involvement have also surfaced. Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh raised the possibility of alien activity behind the drones, fueling even more speculation among followers.But some lawmakers believe the threat is much closer to home. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, took the dramatic step of claiming that the drones could be linked to Iran. In an interview with Fox News, he warned that the drones might be launched from an Iranian \"mothership,\" alleging that the Pentagon is hiding this information from the American public.\u201cWe aren\u2019t being told the truth,\u201d Van Drew told Fox News. \u201cThey are dealing with the American public like we\u2019re stupid.\u201dThe Pentagon swiftly denied these claims. Spokesperson Sabrina Singh addressed the allegations, saying, \"There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there\u2019s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\"As the drones continue to perplex authorities and residents alike, pressure from local officials is mounting. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called for increased federal intervention, citing a shutdown of Stewart Airfield due to drone activity.\u201cThis has gone too far,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cThe Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.\u201dSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed this call for action, demanding answers. \"I\u2019m pushing for answers amid these drone sightings,\" Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. He also noted that it was \"remarkable\" that the public still had more questions than answers.As tensions rise and speculation spreads, the mystery surrounding the drones remains unsolved. Is it an elaborate government cover-up , an extraterrestrial warning, or simply a case of malfunctioning military technology? Only time will tell, but for now, the skies above the East Coast are as enigmatic as ever."

Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month.

However, other findings can reveal our darker side.\n\nThat more bleak part of human nature can be found in the bones uncovered from an archeological site in Charterhouse Warren, Somerset, England. A team recently analyzed over 3,000 bones found there decades ago that date back to the Early Bronze Age. The remains of at least 37 individuals here were killed, butchered, and likely partially eaten before they were thrown down a shaft that is 49-feet-deep.

The bones belonged to a mixture of men, women, and children, which likely means they were representative of a community.\n\nExamples of cranial trauma.

Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nSearching for motivation\u2013and a reason for cannibalism\n\nThe skulls have evidence of a violent death from blunt force trauma, unlike the majority of contemporary burials. Researchers from multiple institutions further analyzed the bones to try and learn more about how these people died. They found several cutmarks and fractures that occurred at or near the time of death on the bones. The team believes that this is evidence that they were intentionally butchered and may have been partly consumed.\n\nTo find clues to why people in Early Bronze Age Britain might cannibalize their dead, they looked at the nearby Palaeolithic site of Gough\u2019s Cave in Cheddar Gorge. Evidence uncovered there suggests that cannibalism was likely a funeral rite in the area. However, Charterhouse Warren is a bit different. The evidence of a violent death with no indication of a fight or struggle implies that the victims were caught off guard. The team believes it is likely that they were all massacred and the butchering was done by their enemies.\n\n[ Related: Bronze Age village was \u2018pretty cozy\u2019\u2014until Britain\u2019s Pompeii. ]\n\nAbundant cattle bones have been found mixed in with the human bones suggests that people at Charterhouse Warren probably had enough to eat, so it is unlikely that they were killed strictly for food.\n\nInstead, cannibalism may have been a way to \u201cother\u201d and dehumanize the deceased. The killers were likening their enemies to animals by eating their flesh and mixing their bones in with animal bones.\n\n\u2018People in prehistory could match more recent atrocities\u2019\n\nThe conflict was likely caused by social factors. Theft or insults may have led to tensions which then escalated out of proportion. Additionally, two of the children had evidence of plague in their teeth. The fear of such a deadly illness may have also exacerbated tensions. Scientists at the The Francis Crick Institute found these signs of plague at Charterhouse Warren in a 2023 study and they were a \u201ccompletely unexpected\u201d finding, according to Schulting. However, the team still does not know what\u2013if any\u2013impact plague had on this conflict.\n\nRight hemi-mandible of child aged about 10 years (a) with detail of cutmarks on the ascending ramus (b).

Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nAs a whole, the discovery of such violence at Charterhouse Warren shows that in at least this instance, perceived slights and cycles of revenge could result in violent actions.\n\n\u201cCharterhouse Warren is one of those rare archaeological sites that challenges the way we think about the past,\u201d said Schulting. \u201cIt is a stark reminder that people in prehistory could match more recent atrocities and shines a light on a dark side of human behaviour. That it is unlikely to have been a one-off event makes it even more important that its story is told.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Following historian and philosopher Hanna Arendt, there is the belief that the public should assert their needs and interests in scientific endeavors.1 But, before the public can weigh in, someone must fully inform them of the issue involved. Once citizens understand a problem, they can ensure, through their political representatives, that the science aligns with their demands and does not go off on its own. For example, once Americans understood the gravity, they clearly articulated that they would not allow science to create human beings in a laboratory or have computers governing the world.\n\nSource: CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\nIn contrast, modern medicine illustrates what happens when the public lacks information and has little input: educators and researchers go on their own\u2014and continue to do so in the face of abject failure. Here is one example in medicine, US citizens do not know how frightful their mental health care is, that medicine refuses to adopt the teaching that would cure it, or that they can direct their politicians to require that change.\n\nWhat do Americans need to know to activate and direct change?\n\n1. Although mental illness is the most common health condition in the US (nearly 100 million Americans in any one year), most people do not know that only 25 percent of patients receive any care, most of which does not meet standards. Compare this to 70 percent of physical disease patients receiving care of high quality. Mistakenly, some uninformed Americans even assume mental health care matches medical care.\n\n2. Few realize that compromised mental health care results from two easily remediable medical derelictions: a) medicine fails to train enough mental health professionals (psychiatrists and psychologists each conduct only 12 percent of care); and b) it provides almost no training for the primary care clinicians who, by default, conduct over 75 percent of mental health care; their lack of training explains why most mental health care is substandard. Shockingly, educators devote only 2 percent of physicians\u2019 training to mental health care. These facts identify the simple but surprisingly overlooked solution to the mental health crisis: train more mental health professionals and train the medical doctors who provide most of the care.\n\n3. Almost no one understands why medicine would resist such obvious solutions. The \u201cmind-body split\u201d philosophy or theory developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries caused this blind spot. In a political compromise, church and science leaders of the scientific revolution agreed to the split: the mind, soul, and spirit went together and were the church\u2019s province alone. Medicine could only consider the physical body and its diseases from the neck down. That made mental disorders and other mind issues, such as emotions, off base for medicine. Although mental health care became medicine\u2019s responsibility in the 1800s, physicians have never deviated from their isolated focus on the physical body and its diseases. Only a small minority of clinicians ever showed any interest in mental health, and the tiny field of psychiatry formed around them; this was often disdained and dismissed by the majority culture. Sadly, medical education has never exhibited an interest in mental illness training for medical students or producing enough residencies to train psychiatrists. On the other hand, medicine has not failed. The mind-body split led to massive physical healthcare improvements in the last century when life survival doubled from 40 years to 80 years.\n\nSource: CC-BY-2.5\n\nNevertheless, the exclusion of a patient's psychological and social life now renders the mind-body split obsolete. It worked primarily for the acute physical and surgical illnesses that medicine has now cured or controlled for the most part (for example, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough; and ether anesthesia). But modern medicine\u2019s patient population has changed\u2014mental illnesses and chronic physical diseases are the most common conditions practitioners face.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s obvious why eschewing the mind shortchanges mental illnesses, almost no one recognizes it is also harming chronic disease care. Most chronic physical disorders are caused by the very psychological and social factors excluded by medical education\u2014lifestyle issues such as cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, overeating and overweight, drug addiction, and stress. Doctors must incorporate lifestyle issues into treatment to improve the underlying physical disease, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, yet they are not taught how to do this. More incriminating, medicine could prevent some 80 percent of heart disease and diabetes and 40 percent of cancers by addressing lifestyle factors. But it waits for cancer and heart disease to occur and then treats the problem.\n\n4. Although most people think medical education and research are scientifically based, the public will no doubt be aghast to learn that it does not follow modern scientific principles. Among all sciences, only medicine does not adhere to modern scientific theory: a systems view of life\u2014where physicians and other scientists must consider all parts of a problem and their interactions.2 Medicine\u2019s isolated disease focus omits the equally important psychological and social parts of its patients. More disturbing, medicine ignores the systems approach proposed for it in the 1970s, the biopsychosocial model. Demonstrably superior and research-based, the model links the patient\u2019s physical disease (biological) features with their psychological and social parts, thus integrating mental health care with medical care. Actively teaching the model would guarantee that the quality of mental health care matched physical disease care. Yet four centuries of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by a now effete theoretical concept has left physicians immune to recognizing its profound shortcomings.\n\nExactly how do we initiate change? Inform the public. Typically, after citizens are informed and angry, they direct their politicians to confront refractory institutions. People knew little, for example, about the risks of automobiles and chemical pollutants. Then came Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader3 and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.4 These books made millions of Americans aware that seat belts saved lives and that we had poisonous DDT in our drinking water\u2014but that the auto and chemical industries refused to install seat belts and remove DDT for financial reasons. An irate US population insisted on change. That\u2019s why you have seat belts and clean water today. And a model for change\u2014informing the public."

When I have written about the ethics of genetically engineered mosquitoes to combat malaria, many of my friends have expressed alarm. \u201cWhat if it goes badly wrong?\u201d they ask. What if there are unintended consequences that ripple across ecosystems? What if this is one of those technologies that cross the line from innovative to utterly world-destroying?\n\nAnd yet, one could also ask, what if we do nothing? For that question, at least we have an answer. A report last week from the World Health Organization reveals that 597,000 people died of malaria last year, overwhelmingly children under age 5, and an estimated 263 million people were sickened. Thousands of families cradled a baby dying from a preventable fever; thousands of pregnancies ended in stillbirth or maternal death.\n\nFor a time in the early 2000s, it seemed as if the world was gaining ground against malaria, but progress has stalled, cases have risen and the hopes for its near-elimination by 2030 have been scuttled. Global warming, armed conflict and lack of funding are all factors. And while new vaccines certainly will help, they are limited in their effectiveness (they reduce the risk of severe malaria by 30 percent and require four separate clinic visits). For much of the world\u2019s poor, we still rely on the 19th-century technology of bed nets and insecticide.\n\nFor the past two decades, scientists have explored whether a new technology known as a gene drive might hold the tantalizing promise of eliminating malaria by targeting the mosquitoes that carry the deadly parasite. The reason the gene drive is so potentially revolutionary \u2014 but disturbing \u2014 is that it uses genetic engineering to introduce changes in mosquitoes that do not stop with one generation, but are preferentially inherited by all future generations."
