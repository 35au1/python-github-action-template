        "article_content": "The Sunday Papers is our weekly roundup of great writing about (mostly) videogames from across the web.\n\nSundays are for eating Biscoff spread and rewatching Better Call Saul, again. Crunchy, ofc. Before that, let\u2019s read some writing that I, Nic Reuben, personally found interesting about games (and game related things!)\n\nBug Quest wrote some nice words about UFO 50.\n\nin fact, UFO 50\u2019s investment in its fiction really only highlights and celebrates the actual human beings who worked on all of its many games. i have no idea how many (if any) of the notes associated with UFO Soft\u2019s games are autobiographical. i know for a fact, though, that UFO 50\u2019s actual developers - Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Ojiro Fumoto, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, and Tyriq Plummer - are, like their fictional counterparts, people with friends and families and dreams and favorite bars and paintings in their offices. humanity is something that we take for granted every time we play a video game, but UFO 50 celebrates it as the thing that makes games so special.\n\nOh hey, more UFO 50. It\u2019s 50 games, it can have two entries. Christian Donlan chatted to Derek Yu for Eurogamer.\n\n\"Each game needed to have its own unique identity but it also needed to be part of the collection,\" Yu explains. \"I would say that most games started as their own thing, though, and then became more and more considerate of their role in the collection as time went on. And through that process, each game's identity actually became stronger because of its connection to the whole. It didn't just exist in a vacuum anymore - a game could be a sequel or share themes with other games or maybe be something one-of-a-kind. There's a lot more context for each game as part of UFO 50 than as a standalone title.\"\n\nEd Smith wrote about Soma for Bullet Points Monthly\n\nThe problem however is that videogames are often so systematic and so mechanical that they are only able to illustrate perfect visions of ideologies. Think about SimCity, or more recently Cities Skylines 2, wherein certain esotericisms of the games\u2019 respective code bases resulted in a large number of homeless people appearing within players\u2019 cities. In both cases, these swells in the homeless population were regarded by the game makers and by players as imperfections within the system, as bugs, as glitches, and they were summarily \u2018fixed.\u2019 Both of these games simulate and symbolise ideologies related to capital, democracy, enterprise, social welfare, policy, and so on, but if the results of those simulations drift outside utopia\u2014when the ideologies in the game result in a lessening of the player\u2019s success\u2014the simulations, the symbols, are considered defective.\n\nthey had a famous mobile game called White Cat Project, not copying Mario, not copying Pok\u00e9mon, not copying Zelda, nothing at all. Nintendo brought forward six patents that they thought that this company was violating inside their very successful mobile game at one time. It was one of the most popular mobile games in Japan, and they built a huge case. One of the patents was for a confirmation screen after sleep mode. You know when devices are sleeping and you want to resume there's a confirmation screen in a lot of games? \u201cAre you sure you want to resume?\u201d And then you tap yes or no. Nintendo has a patent on that, and this game uses it. And then Nintendo said, you know, look, you're using our patent and you cannot do that. You're not paying us any licensing fees.\n\nFor 404 Media, Emanuel Maiberg chatted to Japan game industry analyst Serkan Toto about the Nintendo lawsuit against Palword. (Edit: this wasn't paywalled for me when I included it, but appears to be now. Apologies for the annoyance!)\n\nHere\u2019s a cool mech piece from the RPS archives that came up in Slack this week. Here\u2019s a cool piece on graphics card box art from the archives of that other PC gaming site. Here\u2019s Resident Evil 1\u2019s original cast playing the game. Here\u2019s a brief argument that FromSoftware\u2019s influence is hurting the action genre, which I foresee some of you might enjoy scrapping about on this, the holy Sabbath. RPS contributor and good wordsman Rick Lane has a newsletter recommending Steam demos. I am not immune to Moo Deng propaganda. Music this week is a new mix from Pizza Hotline. Have a great weekend!"

        "category": "ai+app",
        "date": "1h",
        "source": "Mint",
        "article_content": "Unlike many experts who are still awaiting a killer app in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), Naveen Rao, vice-president of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) at Databricks, says the world already has one -- it\u2019s coding.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of developers actually latch onto this, especially younger developers. LLMs (large language models) have also worked on code (besides text, images, audios, videos, etc.), and we're already seeing design automation happening through coding assistance. It (coding) is a sub-class of a much larger class of uses around true design automation,\" Rao told Mint in a recent video interview from his San Diego office.\n\nRao asserts that with many coding tasks getting automated, the ability to innovate in product design and create unique user experiences will become even more valuable.\n\n\"You can now create apps simply by describing them in English. As a result, the value of translating a design idea into an app has diminished because much of that process is now automated,\" he says.\n\nBeing a developer will mean using AI tools effectively, says Rao, adding that the focus will shift to understanding why certain apps succeed while others don\u2019t.\n\nRao underscores, though, that \u201cit will take 3-5 years to engineer these systems to be reliable and deterministic enough to be able to use them in core engineering.\" The reason is that GenAI still struggles with \u201challucinations\" (incorrect or misleading results) and lacks true reasoning capabilities despite claims to the contrary by some big tech companies.\n\nData is eating the world through AI\n\n\"Current LLMs primarily pattern-match based on probabilities, not reason. Unlike humans or even animals that learn through a cycle of action and feedback, LLMs don\u2019t engage in causal, real-world learning. While advancements, like the step-by-step reasoning introduced by OpenAI, are promising, there\u2019s a long way to go,\" elaborates Rao, who has a degree from Duke University in computer science and a PhD in computational neuroscience from Brown University.\n\nHe is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded AI companies Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for about $400 million, and MosaicML that was acquired by Databricks last July for $1.3 billion.\n\nWhat keeps Rao up at night is the gap between AI\u2019s potential and its current limitations, particularly in reasoning. According to him, AI models like DeepMind's AlphaZero, which hypothesize and learn through self-play in structured environments, provide a glimpse of what's possible, \u201cbut we\u2019re far from applying that in the real world.\"\n\n\u201cWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments,\" says Rao.\n\nThis push for reasoning, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily demand greater computing power, according to him. Instead, the shift is towards smaller, high-quality datasets and more targeted tuning, which may not require the massive compute resources associated with training larger models.\n\nRao says this transition from batch offline training to online learning could transform how we approach AI development going forward.\n\nWhy software won\u2019t eat the AI world\n\nRao also insists that software will not eat the AI world, referring to co-founder of US VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen's famous 2011 essay titled, \"Why software is eating the world\". In a 30 August thread on 'X' (formerly, Twitter), Rao argued that the \"...fundamental balance of compute and software is different with AI...In light of @nvidia's strong growth and recent earnings, clearly hardware is an essential ingredient to the current wave of AI\u2026\"\n\nRao says he's more \u201cexcited about the ongoing evolution of hardware, which continues to drive efficiency and lower costs.\" He cites the example of the human brain, which operates on just 20 watts of energy, \u201cshowcasing how far we still are from creating AI systems as efficient and advanced.\" He adds that there's significant progress being made in how AI systems interact with hardware, improving latency, cost, and accuracy.\n\nDatabricks, for instance, is exploring \u201cseveral exciting applications of AI and GenAI, particularly in task automation and creative processes,\" according to Rao. One area of focus is automating tasks like answering human resources (HR) queries or searching through company manuals, where \u201cyou can tolerate some error.\"\n\nYou can now create apps simply by describing them in English.\n\nAnother innovative use involves training LLMs to replicate a specific writing style, aiding news organisations by speeding up content creation. Databricks also supports the use of LLMs in scientific research, such as drug discovery, where AI assists in analysing protein interactions and advancing new drug development.\n\nDatabricks has been recognised as a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for data science and machine learning platforms, 'The Forrester Wave: Cloud Data Pipelines, Q4 2023,\" and the 2024 IDC MarketScape for worldwide analytic stream processing.\n\nKey customers using the Databricks' data intelligence platform to streamline data, AI, and analytics processes include Adobe, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation, Nasdaq, Air India, Parle, MakeMyTrip, Meesho, Tata Steel, and Shell.\n\nData is the AI oil\n\nDatabricks' DBRX model, for instance, can turn raw data into a fully trained, fine-tuned model. Databricks, says Rao, is now focusing on \"compound AI systems,\" which combine multiple AI models, including open-source and proprietary ones, to create advanced solutions. Using this approach, Databricks helped Factset, a financial software provider, improve its query accuracy and efficiency.\n\nData is an essential ingredient in making AI truly add economic value. So maybe now the mantra is: \u201cData is eating the world through AI\", says Rao.\n\nThat said, many companies struggle to bridge the gap between data readiness and effective AI implementation. A key challenge, says Rao, is to understand the economics of AI, which differs significantly from traditional software models like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), where many applications can run on a single piece of hardware.\n\nAI models, on the other hand, require dedicated physical infrastructure for each additional user. This, according to Rao, implies that scaling AI would involve costly hardware investments, resulting in lower gross margins (often below 20%) as compared to SaaS. On the development side, rising costs make profitability difficult, particularly as larger companies continue to raise capital and operate at a loss.\n\nIn this context, the key metric for CXOs when integrating AI is \u201cdefining clear success criteria.\" In AI, especially with custom LLMs, this involves creating an evaluation system, much like an exam, to measure the performance of the AI system, says Rao.\n\nHe adds that Databricks offers various tools for optimisation, such as re-ranking and fine-tuning models, which help improve performance. Establishing and refining these metrics is crucial for successful AI deployment.\n\nHe cites the example of Ola's Krutrim, which is one of Databricks\u2019 customers that built its own AI model using the platform, rather than relying on pre-existing models. Other customers like Freshworks and Air India are using custom LLMs and compound AI systems to automate tasks such as chatbots that assist with queries about baggage policies or refunds, according to Rao.\n\nOla\u2019s model is particularly notable, according to him, due to India's linguistic diversity, where multiple languages such as Hindi, English, and regional languages, are mixed in daily communication.\n\nNew skill sets\n\nThat said, Rao agrees that AI will have a deep impact on jobs, especially given the increasing use of copilots and fully autonomous AI agentic systems in enterprises. Autonomous AI agents, or the so-called 'Agentic AI' systems, refer to AI models that can achieve specific goals without any human intervention.\n\nIt's clear we must decide how humans remain integral to the process, says Rao. Databricks is working on this by developing tools that help customers build high-quality AI agents.\n\nThese agents go beyond simple tasks, automating complex processes using customer data to drive value. However, enterprise customers demand transparency, auditability, and security, making this a challenging area, according to Rao.\n\nWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments\n\nHe adds, \"AI will significantly change jobs, much like other technological advances have in the past. As AI advances, the key skills will include data engineering, system orchestration, product design and AI tool usage.\"\n\nBalancing innovation with responsible AI is also crucial, particularly regarding data privacy, bias, and transparency, Rao acknowledges. Databricks, he adds, excels in governance, with its Unity Catalog ensuring strict security across data and models.\n\nHe elaborates that while bias is application-specific and difficult to automate, Databricks offers filtering tools that allow companies to manage inputs and outputs, ensuring privacy, safety, and content moderation. However, these tools are designed to be flexible and customizable to suit various customer needs.\n\nDo we need a Chief AI Officer?\n\nGiven the complexity of the field, do enterprises need a Chief AI Officer? Especially, given that many large organisations already have senior executive roles like that of a chief information officer (CIO), chief technology officer (CTO), chief data officer, chief digital officer, and even a chief marketing officer (CMO), who oversee a lot of AI functions.\n\nAlso Read: TCS boss Krithivasan is unafraid of GenAI but unwilling to say the worst is past\n\nRao agrees, pointing out that companies reacted to the AI boom by rushing to integrate AI and hiring for this role without clear boundaries, leading to conflicts over budgets and responsibilities. According to him, a more practical solution may be combining data and AI into a Chief Data and AI Officer role, separating these duties from the broader productivity-focused role of a CIO.\n\nLast, but not the least, Rao says that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often misinterpreted. Some define it by how much human productivity it can replace, but true AGI would need to interact with the world, learn from its actions, and adapt\u2014something far beyond the current technology, he explains. He suggests that while AGI remains a distant goal, companies should focus on how AI can improve business processes and customer experiences today."

(NYSE:PLTR) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design\u200b. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets \u2013 over 20% \u2013 to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\n\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors.\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc.

(NYSE:PLTR) builds and deploys software platforms for the intelligence community to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. It also provides software to commercial clients such as banks and hospitals. The company recently announced that it had won a $100 million contract from the US army to streamline the AI infrastructure capabilities of the latter. The contract, awarded by DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, extends the Maven Smart System access to the Army, Air Force, Space Force, Navy, and US Marine Corps. Under the deal, a Palantir platform would support AI battlespace awareness, global integration, force management, logistics, joint fires, and targeting workflows.\n\nCiti analyst Tyler Radke recently met Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) CFO Dave Glazer, penning a research note for investors after the meeting. The note reiterated a Neutral rating on stock with a $30 price target. The analyst told investors that the company remained upbeat on its Artificial Intelligence Platform momentum with consistent macro commentary. However, per the analyst, the recent inclusion of the software firm to the S&P 500 Index saw a 15% share uptick, which increased the valuation of the company to one of the most expensive names in software at a 25-times next 12 months enterprise value to sales ratio.\n\nOverall PLTR ranks 9th on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "article_content": "Hellboy, the most beloved of demonic comic-book manifestations, made his big-screen debut in 2004 with Guillermo del Toro at the helm and Ron Perlman under the horned costume. Over three movies the Dark Horse Comics anti-hero has faced Nazi occultists in the Outer Hebrides, Gaelic underworld royalty at the Giant\u2019s Causeway, Grigori Rasputin, and the Blood Queen.\n\nThese battles may pale beside the slings and arrows behind the scenes. Released in 2008, Del Toro\u2019s Hellboy: The Golden Army left viewers with a cliffhanger when Perlman\u2019s half-demon learned that his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) was pregnant with twins. Nine years later, Del Toro conceded defeat. He bowed out, making way for Neill Marshall\u2019s bloated and unpopular 2019 reboot, starring Stranger Things\u2019 David Harbour.\n\nThe director, who had no say over the final cut, called it the worst professional experience of his career.\n\nFans were understandably cheered when the trailer for Hellboy: The Crooked Man dropped this summer. Directed by Brian Taylor (of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Crank fame) from a screenplay co-written by the Hellboy creator Mike Mignola, Hellboy: The Crooked Man offers a streamlined, back-to-basics horror fantasy.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe fourth film in the franchise lands Hellboy (played by the Deadpool 2 star Jack Kesy) and a rookie Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense agent (Adeline Rudolph) in Appalachia during the 1950s, where they must face the evil Crooked Man of the title and a community of witches, including one played by the rising Irish star Leah McNamara.\n\nReviews have praised this latest Hellboy iteration as the closest big-screen version yet to the comics. The expanded comic-book universe was a brave new world for the Limerick actor.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that I was into before,\u201d she says. \u201cI think Brian [Taylor] was actually happy to hear that. I was doing an audition over Zoom, and he asked me if I had deep knowledge of the previous movies. I had to confess: \u2018I\u2019m going to be completely honest \u2013 I don\u2019t know a thing.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Good, because this is going to be absolutely nothing like the previous films whatsoever.\u2019 That was a great start.\u201d\n\nThat is no longer the case. McNamara grabs a nearby copy of the Hellboy comic and holds it aloft. \u201cAnd now this is one of my favourite comics. The images are stunning to look at. The stories are amazing. You couldn\u2019t ask for better source material. When you work on a script, you read 100 or 120 pages if it\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s what you are drawing from. But with Hellboy you can pull from these beautiful drawings by Richard Corden and Mike\u2019s imagination. The film does an incredible job of staying true to their vision.\u201d\n\nHellboy: The Crooked Man finds a rich seam of folklore in the Appalachian Mountains, the hilly stretch from West Virginia to Mississippi where folk magic continues to thrive under various names: root work, Braucherei, kitchen witching and \u2013 best of all \u2013 granny magic.\n\nLeah McNamara in Hellboy: The Crooked Man\n\nThe movie concerns Tom Ferrell (Yellowstone\u2019s Jefferson White), a native Appalachian returning from the second World War hoping to make amends for his earlier initiation as a witch. He has never practised dark magic but carries a \u201cwitch bone\u201d that protected him from harm in Europe. His former mentor is McNamara\u2019s Effie Kolb, a malevolent entity, who has transformed Tom\u2019s father into a horse and ridden the unfortunate beast to death.\n\nIt\u2019s a role that calls for a bravura performance from the Irish actor, who alternately cackles, seduces and levitates.\n\n\u201cAt horror films I\u2019m always the person watching between my fingers,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw The Ring when I was far too young, and I was absolutely terrified. I still jump out of my seat at every jump scare I see. So going on a deep dive into witchcraft was so interesting, especially learning about folk magic within Appalachia. That is a whole other world. I got all these books on witchcraft, the history of magic and the occult, to really get into the mind of Effie and how she operates. There is a fascinating real-life history of people who are seen as witches or people who practise magic. In certain parts of Appalachia some people still practise folk magic.\u201d\n\nMcNamara grew up watching the Disney Channel and waiting for her chance to shine at the House of Mouse. It wasn\u2019t such a far-fetched notion. Her parents were active in local amateur dramatic groups and her uncle, Paul McNamara, is an opera singer.\n\nLeah McNamara\n\n\u201cI probably announced my attentions when I was three,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019ve had a bad day and tell my friends, \u2018Oh my God, I could have done law,\u2019 everyone is, like, \u2018Yeah, right. There\u2019s absolutely no way in this world you would have ever have done anything else.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcNamara took a degree in drama and theatre at University College Cork, then trained at Bow Street school of screen acting, in Dublin. \u201cI would have loved to go to drama school had I been able to get into drama school,\u201d she says. \u201cI had auditions for Lir, Rada and Lamda. I felt I did well in those processes, but in the end I didn\u2019t get a place across two different years of auditioning.\n\n\u201cBut everything happens for a reason. I actually feel really fortunate to have had that experience. I got to live out of home and have the full college experience at UCC, which is probably not something you enjoy if you are enrolled in those intensive drama schools. There\u2019s always a path to anything you want to do. And it\u2019s your own path. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned along the way.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 McNamara landed a recurring role in the long-running historical mayhem of Vikings, playing Aud, the daughter of Aaron Copeland\u2019s Kjetill \u201cFlatnose\u201d Eriksson. She had to keep her mouth shut while chums guessed possible plot twists in the 2019 drama series Dublin Murders. After that came Normal People. She remained firmly on \u201cTeam Conor and Marianne\u201d when the former took McNamara\u2019s mean girl Rachel to the debs. A nation gasped as Paul Mescal\u2019s Conor was lured away from Daisy Edgar-Jones.\n\nLeah McNamara in Hellboy: The Crooked Man\n\n\u201cNo one could leave their houses at the time,\u201d McNamara says. \u201cThere was a lot of excitement around the show, because Lenny [Abrahamson] is an incredible director and Sally Rooney\u2019s book already had a huge following. A couple of us who had been on the show together were in touch, watching it blowing up online in real time. Suddenly, James Corden and all these people are tweeting about it. It was kind of mad.\u201d\n\n[ Sally Rooney: \u2018There is something Christian about my work, even if I would not describe myself as religious\u2019Opens in new window ]\n\nMcNamara has just received an American visa. \u201cHopefully, this is another realm of opportunity for me,\u201d McNamara says. \u201cI can legally work and act in the US, which is a big deal. There is so much happening at the minute, but definitely Covid had a big knock-on effect on the industry. The [Hollywood actors\u2019] strike has had a further impact. That contracted the business. I have been auditioning for great stuff. I\u2019m still trying to land that next big thing. But people are still feeling it. For an actor, it\u2019s more competitive than ever.\u201d\n\nShe is faring rather well regardless. She recently impressed critics in Then You Run, an eight-part Sky Max nail-biter that casts McNamara as Tara, a youngster who visits her wealthy and estranged father, Orin (Cillian O\u2019Sullivan), in Rotterdam only to go on the lam with the sinister source of his money. She makes her mark as Kellie Ann Ward, daughter of the Traveller kingpin JP (Laurence O\u2019Fuarain) in Guy Ritchie\u2019s TV series The Gentlemen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting work,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on, and they are parts that I love. Then You Run was something I could really sink my teeth into. And to have The Gentlemen going out in the same year as Hellboy? That\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nHellboy: The Crooked Man is in cinemas from Friday, September 27th"

        "article_content": "A new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters reveals that scientists have identified a greater number of black holes in the early universe than previously thought, shedding light on the formation of these cosmic giants shortly after the Big Bang.\n\nThe research, led by astronomers from Stockholm University, utilised NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to survey faint galaxies that existed when the universe was only a few percent of its current age.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlack holes are known to play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, yet their origins remain a mystery.\n\nThe study's co-author, Alice Young, a PhD student at Stockholm University, noted that many of these early black holes appear to be more massive than expected for such an early time in cosmic history.\n\nThis suggests they either formed with significant mass or grew rapidly through accretion of surrounding material.\n\nTo investigate black hole formation mechanisms, the research team re-photographed initial observations taken by Hubble several years earlier. They measured variations in galaxy brightness\u2014indicators of black hole presence\u2014resulting in the identification of more black holes than previous methods had revealed. This is a new image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nThe findings indicate that some black holes likely formed from the collapse of massive, pristine stars during the first billion years after the Big Bang. These early stars were unique, as later generations became enriched with elements from previous stellar explosions.\n\nOther potential formation scenarios include collapsing gas clouds and mergers of stars within massive clusters. Additionally, primordial black holes may have formed through speculative mechanisms in the universe's infancy.\n\nMatthew Hayes, lead author and astronomer at Stockholm University, emphasized that understanding how early black holes formed is essential for piecing together the puzzle of galaxy evolution.\n\nWith this new data, researchers can refine models of how galaxies and their central black holes evolve together.\n\nIn tandem with these findings, astronomers are using the James Webb Space Telescope to further explore galactic black holes formed soon after the Big Bang, aiming to uncover their masses and locations in the early universe.\n\nThis ongoing research is pivotal for unraveling the mysteries surrounding black hole formation and their influence on galaxy development.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Sep 23, 2024"

        "article_content": "The Moon might be a bit of a dark horse when it comes to water.\n\nAccording to a new analysis of mineralogy maps, water and hydroxyl \u2013 another molecule made up of hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 can be found in multiple locations across all lunar latitudes and terrains, even where the Sun shines down most powerfully.\n\nIt's a discovery that has multiple implications. It can help us understand the Moon's geological history and ongoing processes, and inform future crewed missions to Earth's satellite.\n\n\"Future astronauts may be able to find water even near the equator by exploiting these water-rich areas. Previously, it was thought that only the polar region, and in particular, the deeply shadowed craters at the poles were where water could be found in abundance,\" says planetary scientist Roger Clark of the Planetary Science Institute.\n\n\"Knowing where water is located not only helps to understand lunar geologic history, but also where astronauts may find water in the future.\"\n\nThe Moon seems pretty dry and devoid of moisture, and in one sense it is. There is no liquid water pooling on the surface \u2013 no lakes, puddles, or rivers. But studies are increasingly showing that the Moon has plenty of water tucked away.\n\nPrevious studies into where all the water might be hiding suggested that a huge amount could be deep in lunar craters, particularly at high latitudes. These deep pockets are never touched by the direct light and heat of the Sun, which means they may be harboring deposits of ice several meters thick.\n\nBut other recent work has found that other parts of the Moon could have water, too. And now, the work of Clark and his colleagues supports this finding. Water and hydroxyl \u2013 consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom \u2013 appear to be pretty abundant on the Moon, bound up in the minerals that form the rocks and dirt on the surface of the Moon.\n\nThe researchers used data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument on the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, which orbited the Moon in 2008 and 2009, collecting spectroscopic images of the Moon. This data recorded the infrared light reflected by the Moon, looking for colors on the spectrum consistent with water and hydroxyl.\n\nThe researchers found that water and hydroxyl can be found across all latitudes on the Moon, although the molecules appear to be less abundant in lunar mares. But the water-rich rocks that are excavated during impacts can be found wherever such impacts take place.\n\nWater doesn't stay forever. The researchers found that water in the lunar surface is is exposed in cratering events and then gradually destroyed by radiation from solar wind over a timeframe of millions of years. But this process leaves behind hydroxyl. Hydroxyl is also produced by the solar wind, which deposits solar hydrogen on the surface of the Moon, which can bind with oxygen there to produce the molecule.\n\n\"Putting all the evidence together, we see a lunar surface with complex geology with significant water in the sub-surface and a surface layer of hydroxyl,\" Clark says. \"Both cratering and volcanic activity can bring water-rich materials to the surface, and both are observed in the lunar data.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that the water signature of pyroxene \u2013 a type of igneous rock \u2013 changes depending on the angle of the sunlight hitting it. This tidies up a lunar mystery: scientists had observed this changing signature and not known what it meant. It seemed to suggest that water was moving around on the Moon. It still could be, but not as much as the pyroxene signature had seemed to indicate.\n\nFinally, the team's maps give us some more information about another weird Moon mystery \u2013 the lunar swirls. These are strange, swirling patterns on the surface of the Moon, and scientists don't know what makes them, although magnetism could play a role. Clark and his team found that the swirls are very water-poor.\n\nWe don't know what that means for their formation mechanism, but this signature also occurs on parts of the lunar surface that don't have a swirl pattern. These parts, the researchers think, could be ancient swirls that have eroded, leaving only a telltale water signature to tell us they were once there. And that could help us work out what the swirls actually are.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery suggests a possible water source for lunar explorers. By processing the hydroxyl-rich minerals, future astronauts could, indeed, find a way to squeeze water out of a stone.\n\nThe research has been published in The Planetary Science Journal."

The latest findings, from the Pragyan rover, reveal the discovery of an ancient lunar crater. This crater, measuring a massive 160 km in diameter, is believed to predate the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, the moon\u2019s largest and oldest known impact basin. The data was collected before the Pragyan rover and Vikram lander completed their mission on 3 September 2023 and entered sleep mode.\n\n\n\nAncient Crater Older Than the SPA Basin\n\nChandrayaan-3 landing site evolution by South Pole-Aitken basin and other impact craters - revealed in a study led by @PRLAhmedabad scientist Dr. S. Vijayan.#shivshaktipointhttps://t.co/y9yORpviM9 pic.twitter.com/A7Ivtl5C9H\n\nProf. Anil Bhardwaj, FNA,FASc,FNASc,JC Bose Fellow (@Bhardwaj_A_2016) September 22, 2024\n\nScientists at PRL Ahmedabad have detailed their findings in a paper titled Chandrayaan-3 Landing Site Evolution by South Pole-Aitken Basin and Other Impact Craters. According to their analysis, Chandrayaan-3 landed on a much older buried impact crater, which lies around 350 km from the rim of the SPA basin. This ancient crater likely formed long before the SPA basin itself.\n\nRead Also: Beaker Street Science Photography Competition 2024: Australian photographer wins with stunning shot of glowing frog and ghost fungus\n\nNew Insights Into Lunar History\n\nThe Pragyan rover's high-resolution Navcam and optical cameras have captured a \u201csemi-circular, heavily degraded structure\u201d near the landing site. It is now considered one of the moon\u2019s oldest geological features, buried under debris, or ejecta, from the SPA basin and nearby impact zones. These findings are already helping researchers worldwide better understand lunar evolution, and they could play a critical role in future missions, such as Chandrayaan-4, scheduled for 2027.\n\nRead Also: Sunita Williams' birthday: How NASA astronaut celebrates her 59th birthday in space, gifts, and more"

        "article_content": "I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, but ahead of saying goodbye to my original Apple Watch Ultra, I put it back on to test out watchOS 11.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I have reacquainted myself with Apple\u2019s chunkiest smartwatch? Despite initially not being that bothered about moving on, I\u2019m now having second thoughts about it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhy I\u2019m getting rid of my Ultra\n\nThe reason I\u2019m saying goodbye to the Apple Watch Ultra is very simple. It\u2019s being traded in against the new Apple Watch Series 10 in titanium. This is a very expensive smartwatch, and using an old Apple Watch to reduce the price helps soften the blow. I haven\u2019t bought a regular Apple Watch since the Apple Watch Series 7, and its trade-in value is tiny compared to the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s value. So, that\u2019s the one I chose to send Apple\u2019s way in exchange for 280 British pounds, which is around a $370 price reduction.\n\nAt the time, I was totally enamored with the new Series 10 and very keen to see if the titanium version would feel special enough to be considered a luxury smartwatch. As I hadn\u2019t worn the Apple Watch Ultra for a while, I didn\u2019t spend long considering the deal. Then, as the Series 10\u2019s launch day approached, I retrieved the Watch Ultra to unpair it and prepare to send it away, but then Apple released watchOS 11.\n\nSeeing as I was getting the Apple Watch Ultra out anyway, and that this would be the last time I\u2019d likely spend any time with one, I installed watchOS 11 to give it a try. That was a couple of days ago, and rather than feel nothing for the Watch Ultra, I\u2019ve remembered why I fell for it in the first place. Plus, running watchOS 11 has shown me it\u2019s still a top performer today, and that anyone considering upgrading should think about their decision very seriously.\n\nWearing it again\n\nThe last time I spent time with the Apple Watch Ultra, I did so with it attached to a Solo Loop band, which minimized the size and weight so I could wear it for longer. This time I reverted back to the original Ocean Band. The same little problems are still there, as it\u2019s unforgiving on your wrist and can get quite hot, but it also still looks excellent and with a quick rinse under a running tap to get rid of some accumulated dust, it looks as good as new.\n\nTogether with the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s case, the combination makes it a large and fairly heavy pairing, but depending on what you\u2019re used to, it likely won\u2019t take much adjustment before you forget all about it. During a recent trip to Berlin, I chose to wear a Casio G-Shock MTG-B1000XB watch (a bit like this one, but in blue and carbon) that weighs around 120 grams and has a 55mm case. The 95-gram, 49mm Apple Watch Ultra feels almost dainty after that. It\u2019s also a testament to Apple\u2019s excellent design, as the curvy case and smoothed-out button and crown guard means it never digs into your wrist.\n\nThe numbers have never been truly representative of how the Apple Watch Ultra feels to wear anyway. It\u2019s smaller and lighter than you expect, even if you\u2019re used to a regular Apple Watch. This hasn\u2019t changed over time either, as even though I\u2019ve been wearing an Apple Watch Series 9 regularly over the past year, putting the Ultra back on hasn\u2019t left me wanting to change back. I also still love the design with its chunky profile, flat screen, and rough-and-tumble button guard. It\u2019s purposeful without going over the top, yet still unique enough to make a statement.\n\nHas watchOS 11 ruined it?\n\nThe good news is that watchOS 11 has done nothing but keep the Apple Watch Ultra ticking along, but the lack of a couple of features has made me feel a little better about my decision to trade the smartwatch in. The Watch Ultra is smooth and fast with the latest software installed, and while it doesn\u2019t change things much, it\u2019s good to see the Translate app is present and working and the Vitals app installed, too. Outside of Vitals, though, there\u2019s not much in watchOS 11 that I\u2019ll use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nCertainly, if you own an Apple Watch Ultra, there\u2019s no reason not to install watchOS 11. Still, it exposes a couple of unfortunate feature omissions on the Watch Ultra, which may prompt you to consider upgrading to the Watch Ultra 2 or the Apple Watch Series 10 this year. The original Watch Ultra does not support Double Tap, the gesture control introduced with the Series 9, and although it hasn\u2019t seen the upgrades I hoped it would this year, it\u2019s still fun and helpful.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra also does not support Apple\u2019s new Sleep Apnea monitoring feature. Although I do not suffer from the condition, it is worth monitoring over time as it is hard to identify. If you\u2019re at all curious about it, then you may decide now is the time to upgrade your Apple Watch Ultra to the Ultra 2 or a Series 10. You will miss out on these two features if you stick with the original Watch Ultra.\n\nSecond thoughts\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra isn\u2019t the latest and greatest Apple Watch, but it runs the latest software, looks brilliant (and exactly the same as the Watch Ultra 2), wears smaller than its dimensions suggest, has the right adventure watch credentials, and is genuinely tough enough to survive some pretty intensive punishment. Pairing it with my iPhone 15 Pro Max reminded me how quick and easy the setup process is, it has delivered all my notifications reliably, there are many native apps available, and I love that I can control my music from it too. I\u2019m also not the only one to feel this way about it.\n\nDouble Tap wasn\u2019t a reason to buy the Series 9 and isn\u2019t a reason to get the Ultra 2 or Series 10, either. Not everyone will be concerned about sleep apnea monitoring or may already have it on another wearable like the Oura Ring. If that\u2019s you, and you have the Watch Ultra on your wrist right now, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth upgrading it at all this year. I\u2019m trading mine in as part of my job (at least, I\u2019m telling myself that), but if I didn\u2019t want to experience the titanium Series 10, then after wearing Ultra again for a few days, I think it would be staying where it is.\n\nWhat\u2019s very interesting to me is one of the reasons I\u2019m going to try the titanium Series 10 is to see if it can truly feel special. To do this, I\u2019ll have to want to wear it often as part of what makes a watch special to me is when I build memories with it. The Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s ability and action-adventure credentials mean it\u2019s highly likely that some wearers will do exactly this. It gives me considerable hope for the titanium Series 10 and serves as a reminder that, unlike so many smartwatches, the Apple Watch Ultra does have its own personality. I\u2019ll package the Watch Ultra to send away soon, but I will be sad about it. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to enjoy it for a little while longer."

        "source": "AOL",
        "article_content": "Veteran software firm MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)joined several high-profile corporations, such as Nvidia, in executing a forward stock split this year. The company's 10-for-1 split occurred in August.\n\nMicroStrategy's decision to perform a stock split came on the heels of its share price skyrocketing over 100% in 2024. In fact, last October, shares were at a split-adjusted 52-week low of $30.71, but they zoomed as high as $200 this year. With its stock split completed, is now the time to invest in MicroStrategy?\n\nNot necessarily. While the split lowered the price of individual shares, it didn't change the company's overall market value. And assessing whether MicroStrategy is a good investment requires some investigative work to unravel the confusing contradiction between its share-price ascent and its mediocre business fundamentals.\n\nDissecting MicroStrategy's stock success\n\nDespite the surge in share price, MicroStrategy suffers from a trend of declining revenue. Through the first half of 2024, the firm's sales were $226.7 million, down from $242.3 million in the previous year.\n\nAdding to the contradiction between its share price performance and business results is the current consensus among Wall Street analysts. They rate MicroStrategy a buy with a median share-price target of $194, which suggests a belief in upside for the stock. This is in spite of the company exiting the second quarter with a net loss of $102.6 million.\n\nHow to explain this mystery? In a word, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). MicroStrategy began investing in the digital currency in 2020, and through the end of July, it amassed 226,500 Bitcoin. The firm describes itself as the \"largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world.\"\n\nAs the value of the cryptocurrency has risen over the past year, so has MicroStrategy stock. In fact, the company's share price follows Bitcoin pretty closely.\n\nMSTR Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nIn short, the appreciation in the company's Bitcoin holdings, rather than the business intelligence (BI) software platform that launched the firm in 1989, accounted for its share-price growth.\n\nMicroStrategy's software business\n\nSpeaking of its core BI business, what is MicroStrategy doing with it these days? It's integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its software platform and transitioning to a subscription-based cloud computing model.\n\nPreviously, the company relied on selling software licenses, but the subscription approach provides predictable recurring revenue, and it's seeing strong customer adoption. For instance, its Q2 subscription income was $24.1 million, a 21% increase over the prior year's $19.9 million.\n\nWhile the subscription growth is encouraging, CEO Phong Le noted MicroStrategy's transition to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model \"may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue.\"\n\nThat's because software license sales recognize the full income upfront, but with a SaaS model, revenue is recognized over the life of the subscription term. This explains MicroStrategy's trend of declining revenue. The company expects this transition period to last 12 to 18 months, after which year-over-year revenue growth will start.\n\nThe pros and cons of investing\n\nSo far, MicroStrategy's unconventional approach of purchasing Bitcoin has paid off for investors. Between the time when it began buying Bitcoin in 2020 to the end of July, the company's stock price has risen 1,200%. That's far superior to the 64% growth of the S&P 500 index over that time, and even better than Nvidia stock's 948% increase.\n\nThe management team believes it can put cash on the balance sheet to better use by investing in digital capital, specifically Bitcoin. The idea has merit, and as long as the cryptocurrency increases in value over time, this strategy benefits the company.\n\nBut it's not without risk. MicroStrategy's fortunes are now coupled with Bitcoin. This means that what affects the digital currency will have a ripple effect on the firm's stock. For example, regulatory changes involving Bitcoin could have a substantial impact on MicroStrategy.\n\nAnother consideration is how the company is pursuing its Bitcoin strategy. It's funding Bitcoin purchases from the cash generated by its software business, taking on debt, and issuing stock. Over the long term, MicroStrategy's goal is to accumulate Bitcoin faster than it issues shares to generate value for shareholders.\n\nHowever, its cryptocurrency strategy led to the firm accruing a lot of debt on its balance sheet. At the end of Q2, MicroStrategy's total liabilities were $4.2 billion, $3.8 billion of that in debt. Meanwhile, total assets were $7.1 billion, including $5.7 billion in digital assets, namely Bitcoin, and $66.9 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nThis brought MicroStrategy's Q2 debt ratio to 0.55, or 55%. That's an increase from 2023's 0.46, when debt was $2.2 billion and total assets were $4.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, there's the matter of MicroStrategy's core software business. If it fails to grow this business, the company could end up struggling to pay its debt, let alone fund more Bitcoin purchases.\n\nSo for now, buying MicroStrategy stock is only for investors with a high risk tolerance. It's best to reconsider the company after its software business shows year-over-year revenue growth and its balance sheet strengthens.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.
