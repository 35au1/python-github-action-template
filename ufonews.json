            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Rogan has always held a longtime interest in all things UFO.\n\nDuring their sitdown, Rogan speculated that a large chunk of UFO sightings stem from civilians mistaking drone programs for extraterrestrial phenomena. However, when asked by Thiel if he believed that older UFO sightings from decades past were drone programs, Rogan was quick to dismiss the notion.\n\n\"No, those were already that advanced. No, those are the ones that give me pause. That's why when I named my comedy club, The Comedy Mothership, it's all UFO-themed, our rooms are named Fat Man and Little Boy. Our rooms are named after the nuclear bombs, because those nuclear bombs when they dropped them, that's when everybody starts seeing these things.\"\n\nTrending\n\nRogan then highlights the actions he'd take were he a more advanced civilization relative to mankind.\n\nGet the latest updates on One Championship Rankings at Sportskeeda and more\n\n\"I think if I was a sophisticated society from another planet, I'd recognize that there is an intelligence species that has developed nuclear power and has started using it as bombs. I would immediately start visiting and I would let them know, 'Hey, motherf***ers. There's something way more advanced than you.' I would hover over the nuclear bases and shut down their missiles. I would do all the things that the UFOs supposedly did, just to keep the government in check.\"\n\nCheck out Joe Rogan's thoughts on extraterrestrials (2:37:30):\n\nThe longtime UFC commentator is a massive proponent of certain conspiracy theories, and both aliens and space have always been a significant part of the content he engages in.\n\nHe and his close friend Eddie Bravo were previously united in their conspiracy theories surrounding UFOs before Bravo's adoption of the Flat Earth conspiracy theory.\n\nJoe Rogan recently shared Terrence Howard's conspiracy theory about Martian life\n\nOn episode #2247 of his podcast, Joe Rogan and fellow comedian Duncan Trussell found themselves locked in a discussion about the cosmos. At this point, Rogan brought up a conspiracy theory about ancient Martian life impacting the potential trajectory of life on Earth.\n\nThe theory belongs to Terrence Howard, a former 'Iron Man' actor.\n\n\"He thinks that Mars, at one point in time, probably had civilization and life. And then as Mars got further and further and further out from the protection of the Sun, it eventually gets too cold.\"\n\nCheck out Joe Rogan parroting Terrence Howard's ideas (1:39:25):\n\nRogan's interest in space has led to him featuring renowned scientists on his podcast, like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Brian Cox.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

More info\n\nRobbie Williams might be setting his sights on extraterrestrial affairs, as the Angels star has been courted to act as the face of UFOs in the UK. Leading ufologist and documentary maker Mark Christopher Lee believes that Robbie has been picked to potentially be an Earthly ambassador for alien beings.\n\nRobbie is no stranger to alien life either having openly admitted to encountering a UFO so near he could have lobbed a tennis ball at it, reports the Daily Star. He also spoke of the appearance of a 'gold ball of light' during a recording session for his song Arizona which touches on alien encounters.\n\nMr Lee is confident that the evidence presented in his forthcoming documentary, set to release later in 2025, will solidify the reality of alien life. He has also envisioned Robbie as an ideal spokesperson for their existence due to his celebrity status and ability to communicate with the masses.\n\nREAD MORE: Netflix Missing You viewers all notice same problem with Harlan Coben's new series\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nMr Lee has approached Robbie through George Knapp, chief investigative reporter for Nevada's Channel 8 I-Team and creator of 'Hunt For The Skinwalker', which featured the pop icon. He said: \"I do believe what Robbie says. I've spoken to George Knapp, who is friends with him, who is a filmmaker, presenter, journalist. We were chatting about Robbie Williams.\n\n\"I'm trying to reach out to Robbie to push forward for UFO disclosure in the UK. I think he could be a figurehead. We need someone like him in the UK. I want to get together and talk about how we can do that.\"\n\nMr Lee also touched upon the mysterious link between musicians and UFOs, saying: \"People love Robbie, he speaks the truth, he's from the heart. And there is this link between musicians and UFOs. I do think there is that element. I think it's the part of the brain that we're using, that creative side, which is making that contact and what these phenomena is picking up on. It's the collective unconscious. We're all connected and connected to the universe and beyond.''\n\nRobbie's extraterrestrial experiences span three decades. Mark said he believes they keep happening because he has allowed himself to be open to contact.\n\nHe said: \"It's the collective unconscious. We're all connected and connected to the universe and beyond. There's the synchronicities in your life - meaningful coincidences.\""

The idea is to add creator-first AI tools to its software, as well as develop new AI-first tools, like Adobe Project Concept AI while setting up tools to protect ownership.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is clear is generative AI is here to stay, and many artists are using it in their workflows, like digital artist Guillermo Flores Pacheco who creates detailed, colourful collages using Firefly with his regular methods. But as detailed in our digital arts trends of 2025 article there are new laws and legal cases in the horizon that could curtail how AI is used and add copyright protections for artists.\n\nIn fairness to Adobe, it's ahead of the pack when it comes to its approach to protecting artists, and while not always perfect, the direction of travel is welcome. With initiatives like Adobe Content Credentials and Project Know How that track ownership and make clear what is and isn't AI generated Adobe already has more safeguards in place than other creative app developers.\n\nBelow Alexandru Costin, Vice President of Generative AI and Sensei at Adobe, explains in detail the challenges facing artists, how AI can be used safely, what the benefits can be, and how Adobe is putting place the tools to protect copyrights in the AI era.\n\nGuillermo Flores Pacheco interview, a colourful Pelican person for a Photoshop\n\nCB: What does the future look like for AI, art and copyright?\n\nAC: Generative AI is already transforming the creative process, giving creators tools to push boundaries, work more efficiently, and realise their visions faster than ever. At Adobe, we believe AI is here to support and enhance human creativity, not replace it, by enabling artists to create their best work while ensuring they get full credit for it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI has the potential to democratise creativity, putting powerful tools in the hands of everyone, from professionals to small business owners, the world\u2019s largest enterprises and students. Take Adobe Express: its AI-powered features make it easy to adapt content for different channels, seamlessly apply branding, and even rewrite or translate copy in seconds.\n\nHowever, as AI evolves, so do its challenges, especially around regulation, transparency, and intellectual property. Safeguards are critical to ensure that people trust AI and that creators feel their work is protected. Looking ahead, we\u2019re committed to working with policymakers, creators, and the broader community to ensure AI accelerates creativity while safeguarding intellectual property and fostering trust.\n\nAdobe Max 2024, screens from Adobe GenStudio\n\nCB: How does Adobe decide on the Gen AI Firefly features it integrates into its products? Does a new innovation need to deliver a real-world use case?\n\nAlexandru Costin: Our products touch billions of people, which means the decisions about what features we integrate into our products and how we do this matter to us. Our core mission has always revolved around empowering individuals and businesses to unleash their creative potential. Key to this is focusing on generative AI features that empower them to be more creative and productive.\n\nOur family of Adobe Firefly models have the power to augment and amplify human ingenuity by giving people new playgrounds for ideation and exploration. Firefly empowers people to realise their creative visions \u2013 even the most fantastical or surreal ones \u2013 with greater speed, agility, and precision.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, innovative features integrated into Adobe products are also reducing \u2018busy work\u2019, freeing creatives from tedious or time-consuming tasks like resizing images and localising outputs. Once such example is IBM\u2019s recent Let\u2019s Create brand campaign where Firefly was used to generate 200 assets and over 1,000 marketing variations for the campaign in a matter of minutes.\n\nIt is equally important that we also consider how we innovate. Responsible innovation is our top priority whenever we launch a new AI feature. Our AI Ethics principles rooted in accountability, responsibility, and transparency guide us in carefully evaluating every feature before it reaches our users.\n\nFor example, multi-layered impact assessments are key to spotting features that might unintentionally perpetuate harmful biases or stereotypes. That said, we know the job doesn\u2019t end once a feature is live, so we\u2019ve set up ways for users to share feedback, especially if they notice outputs that feel off or biased. This collaboration helps us fix things quickly and continue improving Firefly for our community.\n\nAdobe AI copyrights; logos made for IBM\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCB: How important will some things like tracing credentials and transparency become?\n\nAC: Tracing credentials and transparency are becoming essential in today\u2019s digital landscape. As the lines between real and synthetic or AI-generated content blur, provenance tools like Content Credentials play a critical role in helping to restore trust online.\n\nContent Credentials are akin to a 'nutrition label' for digital content that anyone can attach to their work to share information about themselves and provide context about how it was created and edited. With this information at consumers\u2019 fingertips, they have the ability to decide if they can trust the content they see online.\n\nIn a world where misinformation and deepfakes can cause real harm, features like being able to trace a content\u2019s provenance become essential. We imagine a world where checking for Content Credentials is as habitual as reading a nutrition label on food packaging. This shift represents more than just technological progress \u2013 it's a reimagining of how we establish and sustain trust in the digital ecosystem.\n\nCB: With many artists still concerned about Gen AI, what steps are you taking to ensure those using Adobe apps are confident and comfortable in their use?\n\nAC: We understand that some creators are concerned about generative AI, and we\u2019re committed to addressing these concerns, while fostering confidence in the tools we create.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe created Firefly for the creative community to give them more power, precision and control directly in the workflows they rely on every day. Adobe has always stood with the creative community, and we\u2019re continuing that tradition by ensuring our family of Firefly models are developed with accountability, responsibility, and transparency in mind. To date, Firefly has been used to generate over 16 billion images worldwide and, importantly, it\u2019s trained exclusively on licensed content, including Adobe Stock or content where copyright has expired, so creators can trust the foundation of the technology.\n\nWe also understand that some people prefer not to use AI in their workflows. Adobe offers non-AI-powered applications as well to provide creators choice and respect their preferences.\n\nOur latest offering for our creative community includes the Adobe Content Authenticity web app which has a \u2018Gen AI Training and Usage Preference\u2019 setting, allowing artists to apply Content Credentials to their work to signal if they do not want their work used to train other generative AI models in the market. The web app also allows creators to gain attribution for their work. We believe all models should respect creators\u2019 rights and preferences, and our approach reflects a deep respect for the creative community.\n\nAdobe AI copyrights; a photo of the pyramids in the snow\n\nCB: What measures are in place to prevent Adobe's AI tools from unintentionally infringing on copyrighted works or mimicking the styles of specific artists without permission?\n\nAC: Successfully resolving the copyright question needs careful consideration and collaboration from the public and private sector to ensure that ultimately it is the creator who wins. It\u2019s also important to consider two distinct issues which include input (what model developers are using to train AI) and output (what types of images are being produced by an AI model).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAI is only as good as the data on which it is trained. Training on more data helps ensure the model is more accurate and less biased. Some model developers scrape the web to source their training data, including copyrighted materials. From a legal perspective, this is a question that is currently being considered in countries like the UK and by Congress in the US. At Adobe, we chose to train only on licensed content and public domain content where copyright has expired. Our model is designed to be commercially safe even in an evolving legal landscape.\n\nAt Adobe, we chose to train only on licensed content and public domain content where copyright has expired\n\nWhen it comes to addressing creator concerns, we think it is more effective to focus on output because this is what consumers ultimately see in the marketplace. Reason being that you have some celebrities worried about AI from a name, image and likeness perspective and we\u2019ve heard concerns from a vast array of creators (musicians, graphic artists, photographers, designers) about someone misusing an AI that has been trained on their work to impersonate their style and then using that output to compete with them in the marketplace. That doesn\u2019t seem fair. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve advocated for a federal anti-impersonation right in the U.S. that can give creators protection against these types of bad actors in the age of AI.\n\nCB: How does Adobe engage with artists and the community to gain feedback and react to AI developments and concerns?\n\nAC: Creators are at the core of who we are as a company and building a legacy of trust by supporting them through every evolution in creativity is a responsibility we take seriously. It\u2019s why we constantly engage with our community to understand their concerns. These conversations don\u2019t just guide our innovations; they ensure we\u2019re creating tools that protect, empower, and enhance the creative journey.\n\nAn example of this can be taken from the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which was designed for creators by creators. We worked closely with our creative community at every stage of development - holding one-on-one and group listening sessions to understand their pain points, gathering feedback on key features, and refining the user experience to ensure this web app enhances their creative endeavours.\n\nCB: How is Adobe protecting its users, and do you need other companies to adopt the same processes, and maybe Content Credentials as an industry standard, to ensure it works?\n\nAC: We co-founded the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) in 2019, an initiative aimed at increasing trust and transparency online. Today, the CAI boasts more than 4,000 members consisting of major industry players including global social media platforms, generative AI providers, media organisations, tech companies, camera manufacturers, civil societies and more. Adobe is also a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), a global standards group that evolves the technical specifications for Content Credentials.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen increased adoption and mainstream implementation of Content Credentials from both the public and private sectors, including by Google, TikTok, OpenAI, Meta, LinkedIn, and BBC News. We believe the more places that Content Credentials technology shows up, the more valuable they become as a tool for fostering a trustworthy digital ecosystem.\n\nContent Credentials is also supported in a range of Adobe products and properties including Photoshop, Lightroom, Express, Stock, and Premiere Pro. Importantly, we automatically apply Content Credentials to assets generated with Adobe Firefly as part of our commitment to supporting transparency around the use of generative AI.\n\nAs we navigate a new digital frontier where generative AI offers new possibilities, but also brings uncertainty and challenges with deepfakes and deceptive content, we'll see an unprecedented push for transparency in digital content as the private and public sectors recognise the critical need for an industry-wide content provenance standard. Content Credentials will play a pivotal role in this shift.\n\nTo truly protect creators and address their concerns, cross-industry collaboration between industry and government in working towards an industry-wide content provenance standard will become even more imperative. Whilst Content Credentials may not be a 'silver bullet', they are a critical tool in restoring trust online. Coalescing around this tool can ensure that Content Credentials becomes the gold standard for transparency, authenticity, and trust in the digital age.\n\nAdobe AI copyrights; a boy looks at his phone\n\nCB: Do you see added value to art with attached Content Credentials (in a similar way to the trad art's certificate of authenticity)?\n\nAC: Content Credentials redefine how value is created and shared in the digital art ecosystem, offering profound benefits to both artists and audiences. For creators, the value lies in enhanced protection, recognition, and visibility. For consumers, Content Credentials serve as a window into the art\u2019s origins and story. Audiences can gain deeper insights into the creator\u2019s identity, the creative process, and the tools or techniques used to bring the piece to life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBy connecting creators and viewers through an authenticated digital chain of custody, Content Credentials offer a dual value proposition. It protects and empowers artists while educating and engaging audiences, setting a new standard for integrity and trust in the digital age.\n\nCB: Can Content Credentials be edited or tampered with?\n\nAC: Content Credentials are designed to be a robust and secure way to label digital content by combining three key technologies: secure metadata, watermarking, and fingerprinting. While each of these techniques alone might not be completely durable, together they create a reliable and tamper-proof system.\n\nSecure metadata digitally signs information like when and where the content was created, who made it, and any edits made along the way. Watermarking adds an invisible stamp to the content that isn\u2019t detectable by the human eye or ear. Fingerprinting assigns a unique identifier to the content based on its characteristics, allowing it to be matched to the original provenance information if needed.\n\nThe unique combination of these three techniques under a single solution, Content Credentials, presents the most comprehensive solution today for digital content provenance for images, audio and video."

Now, it, and all of its ghosts, are up for sale.\n\nThere are plenty of ghosts too. From the shadow cowboy that reportedly appears all over the hotel and another cowboy named Slim the likes to whistle to a woman who used to work for the brothel that was run in the hotel and some phantom kids roaming the halls, the hotel is filled with ghostly tenants.\n\nWhich is a good thing since the haunted Olde Park Hotel in Ballinger, Texas doesn\u2019t currently take real, living renters. For the past nine years, the hotel has only been the home to tours and overnight stays paranormal research groups.\n\nAccording to the San Angelo Standard-Times, the current owners, Connie and Dan LaFave, are taking offers for the hotel until the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe new owner would be able to carry on business as normal from here on out as to a new transition and any bookings already made or events set in 2025 would be still honored,\u201d Dan wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe do love the building and everything it has per its rich history and its paranormal. Connie and I are ready to transition to something else in our lives and it is hard to sell, but we both have decided to do this,\u201d Dan wrote.\n\nHe also added, \u201cSoon, we will determine who the new owners of this great place will be. We know that if we do decide to sell it to them, they will most certainly do very special things like we have done in carrying it all forward in honoring what we have done personally and for what this historic and paranormal venue really is.\u201d\n\nThe Olde Park Hotel is just one of several in Texas to be called the most haunted hotel in the state. The Jefferson Hotel in Jefferson, Texas has also claimed that title.\n\nIn 2023, the Jefferson Hotel posted a video taken by a guest who was staying in a room at the hotel when a doll inside the room appeared to move all by itself."

It\u2019s the real-life couples of the hit 2000s paranormal romance series Twilight, based on the novels by Stephenie Meyer From who dated whom on set to who married someone with the same name as them, we found out everything there is to know about the angst teens' current relationships. But don\u2019t let their shine and sparkly fool you; getting there was a tough road for some. Keep scrolling to learn more.\n\nKristen Stewart\n\nKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in 2011\n\nIan Gavan / Stringer/Getty\n\nWhile filming Twilight, Kristen Stewart famously dated her on-screen love interest Robert Pattinson. The couple confirmed their relationship in 2010, but the rumors of their romance began a year earlier. It only took two years before their first controversy ensued.\n\nIn July 2012, Stewart was caught kissing Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders. She then apologized, saying, \u201cI'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.\u201d\n\nA year later, in May 2013, the couple split and accredited Stewart\u2019s infidelity as the reason why, causing Twilight fans all around the world to weep.\n\nLater, in 2016, Stewart opened up about her relationship with Pattinson, saying, \u201cPeople wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t real life anymore. And that was gross to me. It\u2019s not that I want to hide who I am or hide anything I\u2019m doing in my life. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to become a part of a story for entertainment value.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two remain friends to this day, and Stewart even attended Pattinson\u2019s birthday in 2023.\n\nFollowing her split with her former co-star, Stewart came out as queer in 2017 and has gone on to date several different women. Most recently, she has been romantically linked to screenwriter Dylan Meyer. The two have been together since 2019.\n\nKristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer in 2024\n\nStefanie Keenan / Contributor/Getty\n\n\u201cThe first time I told her I loved her, it was like really late, and we were in some like s----- bar,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cAnd her friends were there or whatever, and they walked out, and I was just, like, 'Oh, man, I'm so f------ in love with you.' Like, done. It wasn't, like, 'a thing,' and it also was, like, so obvious.\"\n\nThe pair are still together today and often walk red carpets together.\n\nRobert Pattinson\n\nRobert Pattinson and FKA Twigs in 2017\n\nBEN STANSALL / Staff/Getty\n\nAfter ending things with Stewart, Pattinson dated singer FKA Twigs in 2014. The pair met through their mutual friend, Florence Welch, and dated for three years, but split due to travel issues. There were also rumors that Pattison cheated.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two have remained rather close-lipped about their love affair, but in 2022 Twigs said that she was bullied during their relationship.\n\n\u201cHe was their white Prince Charming, and I think they considered that he should definitely be with somebody white and blonde and ... not me,\u201d she said. \"Say if I was wearing a red dress, they would have a [photo of a] monkey in a red dress, or if I was on a bike, they'd find a monkey on a bike.\"\n\n\"I just remember it had this massive, dysmorphic effect on me for about six months to a year, where every time I saw my pictures, in photographs, I would think, 'Gosh, I look like a monkey, and people are gonna say that I look like a monkey, so I need to really try and hide this monkey-ness that I have.\u201d\n\nFollowing his split with Twigs, Pattinson began a love affair with actress and singer Suki Waterhouse. They met in 2018, made their red carpet debut in 2022, got engaged in 2023 and welcomed their first child in 2024.\n\nRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse in 2024\n\nMonica Schipper / Staff/Getty\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think Rob\u2019s quite funny,\" Waterhouse said in a rare public comment regarding her partner. \"I light up when I\u2019m around him.\u201d\n\nPattinson and Waterhouse are still together to this day, and they\u2019re often seen on the red carpet at events.\n\nTaylor Lautner\n\nTaylor Lautner and Taylor Lautner in 2024\n\nKevin Winter / Staff/Getty\n\nTaylor Lautner has been in several high-profile relationships throughout his career, most notably with actress Billie Lourd, actress Marie Avgeropoulos and even singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Sadly, none of them worked out, though, and instead, Lautner married registered nurse Taylor Dome. The two started dating after Lautner\u2019s sister introduced them in 2018, got engaged in 2021 and then tied the knot in November the next year.\n\nDome changed her last name following the wedding, making both parties \u201cTaylor Lautner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cPackages are becoming tough. We need to figure something out because when I'm buying stuff for her, and she's buying stuff for me, we're going to have some surprises spoiled if we open the wrong Taylor Lautner package,\" the Twilight star joked.\n\n\"TSA ... they'll be, like, 'Which one of you is Taylor Lautner?' And we're, like, 'Both of us.' They're, like, \u2018Meh, this seems fishy. We're gonna send you to security.\u2019\"\n\nSo far, it seems like the name thing hasn\u2019t been a problem and the two remain happily married to this day. They often post about their outings on social media and even co-host a podcast together called The Squeeze with Taylor Lautner & Taylor Lautner. They also got matching tattoos together.\n\nAshley Greene\n\nAshley Greene and Paul Khoury in 2024\n\nUnique Nicole / Stringer/Getty\n\nAlice might have been able to see the future, but we don\u2019t think even she would have been able to see how happy actress Ashley Greene would be with her future husband, Paul Khoury. The two got married in 2018 and welcomed their first child in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFive years ago I married my best friend... 5 years later, you still give me giggles and butterflies,\u201d Greene wrote in 2023. \u201c I knew I loved you then, but I could never understand how much I would love you now. Life with you is the greatest adventure.\u201d\n\nGreene and Khoury are still together and often post glowing love letters to each other on social media.\n\nJackson Rathbone\n\nJackson Rathbone and Sheila Hafsadi in 2017\n\nLily Lawrence / Stringer/Getty\n\nJasper and Alice might not have ended up together, but actor Jackson Rathbone did end up happily married to Sheila Hafsadi. They have been married since 2020 after welcoming their son together in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are both spontaneous people. I wouldn\u2019t say we are bohemian, but we are both artistic,\u201d Rathbone said. \u201cIt was one of those things. I always said I believed in love at first sight, but I never really had that feeling before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRathbone and Hafsadi are still together as of now, but remain rather quiet on social media.\n\nNikki Reed\n\nIt turns out Nikki Reed just couldn\u2019t leave the world of brooding vampires behind because, in 2015, she married fellow teen heartthrob Ian Somerhalder.\n\nBefore that, though, she married Paul McDonald in 2011 and remained with him until 2015. The details around their relationship and split remain unclear.\n\nNikki Reed and Paul McDonald in 2014\n\nTaylor Hill / Contributor/Getty\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter that, though, Reed moved on to Somerhalder and has been with him ever since. They have since welcomed three kids together.\n\nNikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder in 2024\n\nGreg Doherty / Stringer/Getty\n\n\u201cWe live such crazy nomadic lifestyles all over the place, on planes, and [we've had] to uproot and move,\u201d Reed said in 2018. \"Now that we're a family, the whole family goes together so that Mom and Dad can both be there at every second to witness every milestone and everything that's happening.\"\n\n\"It's kind of like you pick up the whole house and move it and set the house down. We definitely are feeling right now like we miss home.\"\n\nReed and Somerhalder are still happily married and often post about each other on their respective socials.\n\nKellan Lutz\n\nKellan Lutz and Brittany Lutz in 2019\n\nJesse Grant / Stringer/Getty\n\nIn 2017, actor Kellan Lutz married Brittany Lutz. They have since welcomed two kids together.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a good dad,\u201d Brittany wrote on Instagram in September 2024. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to his kids is important to him.\u201d\n\nThe couple is still going strong, and while they don\u2019t do a lot of interviews, they do post together on social media.\n\nFor more real life couples, keep scrolling!\n\nDrama, Romance and Real Love: The \u2018Beverly Hills, 90210\u2019 Cast\u2019s Real-Life Relationships Revealed!\n\n\u2018Will and Grace\u2019 Cast: Real-Life Couples, Romances, and Marriages Revealed!\n\nInside the Real-Life Relationships of \u2018The King of Queens\u2019 Cast: Love Stories and Heartbreak"

            "article_content": "Peter Jackson\u2019s The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a monumental achievement in the history of cinema, as he applied a variety of directorial techniques he honed on small-budgeted movies and applied them to the beloved fantasy series from author J.R.R. Tolkien. While Jackson understandably utilized a variety of his skills to bring the project to life, Jackson himself has confirmed that the entire impetus for pitching an adaptation of the series was based on how his production team on 1996\u2019s The Frighteners had to purchase dozens of computers to develop the movie\u2019s visual effects, sparking inspiration in Jackson about how he could make use of the equipment. There were other factors along the way that helped motivate Jackson, but that initial spark is all due to The Frighteners.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\n\u201cOne of the things that happened with The Frighteners was our own visual effects company down here in New Zealand, called W\u0113t\u0101, expanded from having one single computer to about 35 computers, I think, is what we ended up with at the height of the effects on The Frighteners, and there\u2019s about 500 CG shots in the film,\u201d Jackson detailed on a featurette for The Frighteners 10th-anniversary DVD release. \u201cIt was during the post-production on The Frighteners that everyone was feeling very stressed, we were trying to get all these 500 CG shots done, and I was coming under a stress all on my own, because I was wondering, \u2018Gosh, what am I gonna do with all these computers when the movie is finished?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt was at that time, it was about November \u201995 while we were just in the thick of post-production that the idea of doing a fantasy film came about, that I thought, \u2018Well, what type of movie could I make that\u2019s gonna need a big computer infrastructure?\u2019 and the idea of doing The Lord of the Rings came into my mind then and the first phone calls about Lord of the Rings were made during the post-production on The Frighteners because I was starting to stress out about having all of these computers and not going to have a film to actually use them on.\u201d\n\nThanks to boundary-pushing movies like Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Dead Alive, Jackson caught the attention of American studios thanks to the impressive things he accomplished with the minuscule budgets of these passion projects. While devout horror fans were somewhat aware of Jackson, it was much harder to track down his indie efforts, as VHS was the only substantial way that American audiences could witness his work, meaning his abilities were often overlooked. Interestingly, filmmaker Sam Raimi similarly delivered audiences compelling, independent horror features in the \u201980s and \u201990s with his The Evil Dead trilogy and Darkman before making the jump to Spider-Man in 2002, effectively changing the entire landscape of comic book cinema.\n\nThe Frighteners stars Michal J. Fox as a man who had a near-death experience, allowing him to see ghosts around him. He used these skills to serve as a paranormal investigator, charging homeowners a fee for his services, though he was actually coordinating with these ghosts to pull off the \u201cparanormal hauntings\u201d these homeowners had been subjected to. This element of the premise is what caused the more comedic moments in the movie, but when an otherworldly, cloaked figure starts eradicating ghosts as well as living people, Fox\u2019s character and his ghostly allies aim to uncover the specter who is responsible for the chaos.\n\nAdding another interesting connection between the two films is that the cloaked figure in The Frighteners has a striking similarity to the Ringwraiths in Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings movies, serving as a direct nod to the movie that offered him the resources to bring to life the iconic trilogy.\n\nWhat do you think of The Frighteners?

The footage, showing shadowy figures in the clouds, has left viewers both intrigued and baffled, fueling debates across the internet.The video, shot by a passenger in a commercial plane, first shows, what seems like, two human beings standing on a cloud. Not just that, the camera then pans to show several such human-like shapes standing on clouds. The clip was posted by Myra Moore, a content creator who identifies as a paranormal expert and has since received about 5 million views. The caption of the post reads as follows, \u201cA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?\u201dIn the video, Myra explains that the video was shot by a passenger on a plane. \u201cThey were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture,\u201d she continued.Reacting to the post, one user commented, \u201cThis is crazy, is that aliens or humans in the cloud?\" However, some were a little more skeptical, \u201cWhy does the person with the camera keep panning around? Why can't they focus on those \"people\" and see if they move or see what they are doing?\u201d Some even straight-up called this a creation of AI, \u201cEveryone is getting fooled so hard by AI! If you haven\u2019t seen it in the last 30-40 years, then it\u2019s probably AI!\u201dOne user in the comment section reasoned that maybe what one can see in the video is an interplay of light, shadows, and human imagination. The human mind tries to find patterns and assigns meaning to random shapes\u2014a phenomenon known as pareidolia, where we see familiar forms, such as faces or figures, in otherwise abstract visuals. It is thus suggested, to not spread fear based on such videos until they are not authenticated."

Researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham found these ancient tracks at Dewars Farm Quarry, revealing the movement patterns of dinosaurs, including the formidable nine-meter predator Megalosaurus.\n\nThe excavation uncovered five extensive trackways, with four belonging to massive herbivorous sauropods, likely the Cetiosaurus, a large dinosaur related to the Diplodocus. The fifth trackway was attributed to the carnivorous Megalosaurus, noted for its distinctive three-toed feet.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the find is the point where tracks from the carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs intersect, prompting questions about their interaction. This discovery offers fresh insights into these ancient creatures' behaviors and habitats, underscoring the enduring allure of dinosaur science since Megalosaurus was first described in 1824.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Back in May, OpenAI said it was developing a tool to let creators specify how they want their works to be included in \u2014 or excluded from \u2014 its AI training data. But seven months later, this feature has yet to see the light of day.\n\nCalled Media Manager, the tool would \u201cidentify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video,\u201d OpenAI said at the time, to reflect creators\u2019 preferences \u201cacross multiple sources.\u201d It was intended to stave off some of the company\u2019s fiercest critics, and potentially shield OpenAI from IP-related legal challenges.\n\nBut people familiar tell TechCrunch that the tool was rarely viewed as an important launch internally. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a priority,\u201d one former OpenAI employee said. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it.\u201d\n\nA non-employee who coordinates work with the company told TechCrunch in December that they had discussed the tool with OpenAI in the past, but that there haven\u2019t been any recent updates. (These people declined to be publicly identified discussing confidential business matters.)\n\nAnd a member of OpenAI\u2019s legal team who was working on Media Manager, Fred von Lohmann, transitioned to a part-time consultant role in October. OpenAI PR confirmed Von Lohmann\u2019s move to TechCrunch via email.\n\nOpenAI has yet to give an update on Media Manager\u2019s progress, and the company missed a self-imposed deadline to have the tool in place \u201cby 2025.\u201d (To be clear, \u201cby 2025\u201d could be read as inclusive of the year 2025, but TechCrunch interpreted OpenAI\u2019s language to mean leading up to January 1, 2025.)\n\nIP issues\n\nAI models like OpenAI\u2019s learn patterns in sets of data to make predictions \u2014 for instance, that a person biting into a burger will leave a bite mark. This allows models to learn how the world works, to a degree, by observing it. ChatGPT can write convincing emails and essays, while Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, can create relatively realistic footage.\n\nThe ability to draw on examples of writing, film, and more to generate new works makes AI incredibly powerful. But it\u2019s also regurgitative. When prompted in a certain way, models \u2014 most of which are trained on countless web pages, videos, and images \u2014 produce near-copies of that data, which despite being \u201cpublicly available,\u201d are not meant to be used this way.\n\nFor example, Sora can generate clips featuring TikTok\u2019s logo and popular video game characters. The New York Times has gotten ChatGPT to quote its articles verbatim (OpenAI blamed the behavior on a \u201chack\u201c).\n\nThis has understandably upset creators whose works have been swept up in AI training without their permission. Many have lawyered up.\n\nOpenAI is fighting class action lawsuits filed by artists, writers, YouTubers, computer scientists, and news organizations, all of whom claim the startup trained on their works illegally. Plaintiffs include authors Sarah Silverman and Ta Nehisi-Coates, visual artists, and media conglomerates like The New York Times and Radio-Canada, to name a few.\n\nOpenAI has pursued licensing deals with select partners, but not all creators see the terms as attractive.\n\nManaging media\n\nOpenAI offers creators several ad hoc ways to \u201copt out\u201d of its AI training. Last September, the company launched a submission form to allow artists to flag their work for removal from its future training sets. And OpenAI has long let webmasters block its web-crawling bots from scraping data across their domains.\n\nBut creators have criticized these methods as haphazard and inadequate. There aren\u2019t specific opt-out mechanisms for written works, videos, or audio recordings. And the opt-out form for images requires submitting a copy of each image to be removed along with a description, an onerous process.\n\nMedia Manager was pitched as a complete revamp \u2014 and expansion \u2014 of OpenAI\u2019s opt-out solutions today.\n\nIn the announcement post in May, OpenAI said that Media Manager would use \u201ccutting-edge machine learning research\u201d to enable creators and content owners to \u201ctell [OpenAI] what they own.\u201d OpenAI, which claimed it was collaborating with regulators as it developed the tool, said that it hoped Media Manager would \u201cset a standard across the AI industry.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has never publicly mentioned Media Manager since.\n\nA spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool was \u201cstill in development\u201d as of August, but didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request for comment in mid-December.\n\nOpenAI has given no indication as to when Media Manager might launch \u2014 or even which features and capabilities it might launch with.\n\nFair use\n\nAssuming Media Manager does arrive at some point, experts aren\u2019t convinced that it will allay creators\u2019 concerns \u2014 or do much to resolve the legal questions surrounding AI and IP usage.\n\nAdrian Cyhan, an IP attorney at Stubbs Alderton & Markiles, noted that Media Manager as described is an ambitious undertaking. Even platforms as large as YouTube and TikTok struggle with content ID at scale. Could OpenAI really do better?\n\n\u201cEnsuring compliance with legally required creator protections and potential compensation requirements under consideration presents challenges,\u201d Cyhan told TechCrunch, \u201cespecially given the rapidly-evolving and potentially divergent legal landscape across national and local jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nEd Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that certifies AI companies are respecting creators\u2019 rights, believes that Media Manager would unfairly shift the burden of controlling AI training onto creators; by not using it, they arguably could be giving tacit approval for their works to be used. \u201cMost creators will never even hear about it, let alone use it,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut it will nevertheless be used to defend the mass exploitation of creative work against creators\u2019 wishes.\u201d\n\nMike Borella, co-chair of MBHB\u2019s AI practice group, pointed out that opt-out systems don\u2019t always account for transformations that might be made to a work, like an image that\u2019s been downsampled. They also might not address the all-to-common scenario of third-party platforms hosting copies of creators\u2019 content, added Joshua Weigensberg, an IP and media lawyer for Pryor Cashman.\n\n\u201cCreators and copyright owners do not control, and often do not even know, where their works appear on the internet,\u201d Weigensberg said. \u201cEven if a creator tells every single AI platform that they are opting out of training, those companies may well still go ahead and train on copies of their works available on third-party websites and services.\u201d\n\nMedia Manager might not even be especially advantageous for OpenAI, at least from a jurisprudential standpoint. Evan Everist, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney specializing in copyright law, said that while OpenAI could use the tool to show a judge it\u2019s mitigating its training on IP-protected content, Media Manager likely wouldn\u2019t shield the company from damages if it was found to have infringed.\n\n\u201cCopyright owners do not have an obligation to go out and preemptively tell others not to infringe their works before that infringement occurs,\u201d Everist said. \u201cThe basics of copyright law still apply \u2014 i.e., don\u2019t take and copy other people\u2019s stuff without permission. This feature may be more about PR and positioning OpenAI as an ethical user of content.\u201d\n\nA reckoning\n\nIn the absence of Media Manager, OpenAI has implemented filters \u2014 albeit imperfect ones \u2014 to prevent its models from regurgitating training examples. And in the lawsuits it\u2019s battling, the company continues to claim fair use protections, asserting that its models create transformative, not plagiaristic, works.\n\nOpenAI could well prevail in its copyright disputes.\n\nThe courts may decide that the company\u2019s AI has a \u201ctransformative purpose,\u201d following the precedent set roughly a decade ago in the publishing industry\u2019s suit against Google. In that case, a court held that Google\u2019s copying of millions of books for Google Books, a sort of digital archive, was permissible.\n\nOpenAI has said publicly that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train competitive AI models without using copyrighted materials \u2014 authorized or no. \u201cLimiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today\u2019s citizens,\u201d the company wrote in a January submission to the U.K.\u2019s House of Lords.\n\nShould courts eventually declare OpenAI victorious, Media Manager wouldn\u2019t serve much of a legal purpose. OpenAI seems to be willing to make that bet \u2014 or to reconsider its opt-out strategy.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

            "article_content": "OpenAI held a massive ChatGPT-centric event before Christmas, making several key announcements for ChatGPT and other genAI tools it currently offers. The reasoning ChatGPT model o1 and the text-to-video Sora service got public releases. OpenAI also demoed the o3 model coming later this year, released Canvas, and even made ChatGPT available via WhatsApp texting.\n\nWhat OpenAI failed to do is keep a privacy promise made earlier this year. The company announced a Media Manager feature back in May. The tool is meant to allow creators of all sorts of content to opt out of ChatGPT and other genAI models training.\n\nOpenAI said Media Manager will be available by 2025, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Not only that, but the company might not be actively working on the feature, and there\u2019s no telling when it will come out.\n\nTraining models like ChatGPT require lots of data so the AI can learn to predict what the user needs. OpenAI uses all sorts of data from the internet to train its AI, including copyright content from creators it didn\u2019t obtain access to. Several creators sued the company after finding their works were used to train the AI.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMedia Manager should be a tool that lets creators opt out of training for all sorts of media content, not just written text. OpenAI described Media Manager as a cutting-edge tool to protect user privacy:\n\nThis will require cutting-edge machine learning research to build a first-ever tool of its kind to help us identify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video across multiple sources and reflect creator preferences.\n\nWhile that sounded great on paper, we have all forgotten about it. OpenAI has not mentioned Media Manager since May, and development for the privacy tool might not have advanced. Says TechCrunch, which talked to people familiar with the project.\n\nThe blog has learned that Media Manager was rarely viewed as an important project internally. A former OpenAI employee told TechCrunch that Media Manager wasn\u2019t a priority. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it,\u201d they said.\n\nAlso, a person who doesn\u2019t work at OpenAI but coordinates work with the AI firm said they discussed the tool with the company but haven\u2019t received any updates.\n\nTechCrunch also notes that an OpenAI legal team member involved with Media Manager transitioned to a part-time consultant role.\n\nNone of this comes directly from OpenAI. Insiders who shared information might not have access to the bigger picture. But even if TechCrunch\u2019s information isn\u2019t accurate, there\u2019s still the fact that OpenAI has been quiet on the Media Manager feature for half a year.\n\nIf it were finished, the privacy tool could have easily been a \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement. At the very least, OpenAI could have updated the timeline.\n\nA more cynical view is that OpenAI is biding its time. Recent reports said that training next-gen ChatGPT versions isn\u2019t working as planned. OpenAI saw delays for GPT-5, and access to better-quality training data might be one factor impacting development. Copyrighted content that makes it into AI training data could be better quality than other types of content. I\u2019m just speculating here.\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that a Media Manager tool might be released eventually, maybe once the copyright lawsuits against OpenAI are concluded and the company knows exactly what it can and can\u2019t do when training new AI models. Who knows if Media Manager might be needed once that happens. Also, ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 upgrade might get out of development and closer to release by then.\n\nFinally, even if Media Manager were available, it would still require some work from creators to flag out copyrighted content that should not train the AI. Despite that, copyright content might be found in all sorts of places on the internet that creators would not flag. OpenAI would crawl those places and the content might still make it into training data sets.\n\nMedia Manager delays aside; regular ChatGPT users have privacy settings at their disposal to opt out of having the data in their prompts train the AI."

            "article_content": "There is very little movement in markets over the Christmas period, so this week we are looking at selling and what might affect markets in the new year.\n\nThis time of the year is quieter on tillage farms.\n\nYes, there is still work to be done, but there is time to catch up on crop records, costs and returns.\n\nKnowing the costs and returns of all your crops is essential.\n\nIn order to decide on what price to sell your grain at, you need to know your costs, so get this job done as soon as possible and decide on a price that you are happy to sell at to spread risk.\n\nThis was brought up numerous times at Tillage Day 2024 and it was clear it is a job that more farmers need to do.\n\nHaving those figures to hand and deciding on a number to sell at makes the decision easier to make once you get a text message with prices from your co-op or merchant.\n\nForward selling\n\nIn recent years, harvest prices have worked out very well for people, but that doesn\u2019t say it will happen every year.\n\nThat said, you are probably better off to either take the harvest price every year or do some forward selling every year, rather than dipping in and out of both of them, or else you may lose out badly in certain years.\n\nIf you are forward selling grain, then you should only be selling about 50% on your estimated production. You should be a little bit pessimistic with yield predictions as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you have sold grain, but don\u2019t have that grain. At Tillage Day, Donal Moloney of Tirl\u00e1n explained that farmers can sell as little as 20t at a time when forward selling grain.\n\nIf you think about that, you could be selling small amounts of grain every week or every two weeks or even once a month to get an average price from the season.\n\nThis would be spreading risk - something similar to the Boortmalt pricing system where an average price is taken every week from the middle of April to the middle of September.\n\n2025 prices\n\nLooking ahead to prices and it is very hard to know where they will end up this season. There was a lift in prices in December.\n\nTeagasc economist Fiona Thorne estimated that prices could rise by 5% in 2025 at their recent Outlook Conference.\n\nThis prediction was based on the difference between historic predicted values of French wheat prices and the actual outcomes.\n\nTeagasc estimated an increase in EU cereal production and an increase in Irish cereal yields. Looking at costs and Teagasc placed fertiliser prices down 5%, but fertiliser use up on a whole-farm basis."

            "source": "InfoQ",
            "article_content": "An app's performance is key to make users want to use it, say Meta engineers Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson. This includes making the app lightning-fast, battery-efficient, and reliable across a range of devices and connectivity conditions.\n\nTo improve Threads performance, Meta engineers measured how fast the app launches, how easy it is to post a photo or video, how often it crashes, and how many bug reports people filed. To this aim, they defined a number of metrics: frustrating image-render experience (FIRE), time-to-network content (TTNC), and creation-publish success rate (cPSR).\n\nFIRE is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, which may lead to them leaving the app while the image is rendering across the network. Roughly, FIRE is defined as the quotient of the number of users leaving the app before an image is fully rendered by the sum of all users attempting to display that image. Measuring this metric allows Threads developers to detect any regressions in how images are loading for users.\n\nTime-to-network content (TTNC) is roughly the time required for the app to launch and display the user's feed. Long loading time is another experience killer that may lead users to abandon the app. Reducing the app's binary size is paramount to keeping the binary small:\n\nEvery time someone tries to commit code to Threads, they\u2019re alerted if that code change would increase our app\u2019s binary size above a configured threshold.\n\nAdditionally, they removed unnecessary code and graphics assets from the app bundle, resulting in a binary one-quarter the size of Instagram.\n\nAs to navigation latency, this is possibly even more critical than launch time. Meta engineers carried through A/B tests to find out that:\n\nWith the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.\n\nTo ensure that no changes cause a regression in navigation latency, Meta engineers created SLATE, a logger system that tracks relevant events like triggers of a new navigation, the UI being built, activity spinners, and content from the network or an error being displayed.\n\nIt\u2019s implemented using a set of common components that are the foundation for a lot of our UI and a system that measures performance by setting \u201cmarkers\u201d in code for specific events. Typically these markers are created with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nCreation-publish success rate (cPSR) measures how likely it is for an user to successfully complete the process of posting some content. On iOS, posting a video or large photo is especially tricky, since the user could background the app after posting their content without waiting for the upload to complete, in which case the app may be terminated by the OS.\n\nHere, the approach taken by Meta was aimed at improving the user experience in those cases when posting failed. This was accomplished by introducing a new feature, called Drafts, to allow users to manage failed posts in more flexible ways instead of just providing the option to retry or abort the operation.\n\nWe discovered that 26 percent fewer people submitted bug reports about posting if they had Drafts. The feature was clearly making a difference.\n\nAnother approach was trying to reduce perceived latency, as opposed to absolute latency, showing a request has been received when the data upload completes but before it\u2019s been processed and published.\n\nLast but not least, Meta engineers saw a great improvement in app stability after they adopted Swift's complete concurrency, which, they say, does a great job at preventing data races and reducing hard-to-debug problems caused by data races."

This guide by Christian Peverelli provides a detailed roadmap to help you create and monetize a no-code AI business focused on resume optimization for job seekers. By addressing a specific problem, using no-code platforms, and targeting the right audience, you can develop a functional and revenue-generating product in a short timeframe.\n\nChristian Peverelli takes you behind the scenes of a whirlwind 3 day journey, showing how a simple yet impactful idea\u2014an AI-powered resume optimization tool\u2014was transformed into a functional, revenue-generating product. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring entrepreneur, a tech enthusiast, or just someone curious about how to bring an idea to life, you\u2019ll find actionable insights here. From brainstorming and branding to building and selling, this guide breaks down the process step by step, offering a roadmap to help you create your own no-code business.\n\nCreating an AI Business\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Identified a clear problem: Job seekers struggle with resume customization, addressed by an AI-powered resume optimization tool with a freemium model.\n\nBuilt a strong brand (\u201cGet Get Job\u201d) with professional branding elements and a user-focused landing page to attract and convert users.\n\nDeveloped the product using no-code platforms like Bolt, Supabase, and Make.com, allowing rapid creation without coding expertise.\n\nAcquired customers through LinkedIn outreach, using tools like Outbond and Smartlead, and offered discounted plans to attract early adopters.\n\nAchieved profitability within 72 hours, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, showcasing the feasibility of launching a no-code AI business quickly.\n\n1: Identify the Problem and Validate Your Idea\n\nThe foundation of any successful business lies in solving a real-world problem. In this case, the challenge was clear: job seekers often struggle to tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions. This process is not only time-consuming but also tedious, leaving many job seekers frustrated. The solution? An AI-powered resume optimization tool that simplifies and streamlines this task.\n\nThe target audience was identified as active job seekers, particularly those using platforms like LinkedIn. These individuals could benefit significantly from a tool that automates resume customization. To validate the idea, a freemium business model was chosen. This model offered basic features for free while charging $29 per month (or discounted annual plans) for premium features. This pricing strategy ensured accessibility while providing a clear path to revenue generation.\n\n2: Build a Strong Brand\n\nA strong and cohesive brand identity is critical for building trust and attracting users, especially in the early stages of a business. The business was named \u201cGet Get Job,\u201d a memorable and relevant name that resonated with the target audience. Branding elements such as a professional logo, a consistent color palette, and a user-friendly landing page were created using tools like Namecheap, Luca, and Coolors.\n\nThe landing page played a pivotal role as the primary point of interaction with potential users. It clearly outlined the product\u2019s features, benefits, and pricing structure, making it easier to convert visitors into users. A well-designed landing page is not just a marketing tool; it is the cornerstone of any successful online business, as it establishes credibility and communicates value effectively.\n\nBuild a Profitable AI Business in 72 Hours (No-Coding)\n\nEnhance your knowledge on AI business optimization by exploring a selection of articles and guides on the subject.\n\n3: Develop the Product Without Coding\n\nThanks to advancements in no-code platforms, creating a functional product without writing a single line of code is now possible. For this project, the app was built using Bolt, a no-code app builder, while automation workflows were implemented through Make.com. Supabase was used to handle backend tasks such as user authentication and data storage.\n\nThe core functionality of the product revolved around solving the identified problem. Users could upload their resumes, link job descriptions, and receive AI-generated, optimized resumes tailored to specific roles. This feature directly addressed the pain point of resume customization, offering a practical and valuable solution for job seekers. By using no-code tools, the development process was not only faster but also more cost-effective, allowing the focus to remain on delivering a high-quality user experience.\n\n4: Acquire Customers\n\nWith the product ready, the next step was to attract users. LinkedIn emerged as the ideal platform for outreach due to its large base of job seekers. Tools like Outbond and Smartlead were used for lead generation, contact enrichment, and email automation. These tools enabled personalized communication at scale, making it easier to connect with potential users.\n\nTo incentivize early adopters, discounted annual plans were offered. This strategy not only encouraged sign-ups but also provided valuable feedback for refining the product. Early customer acquisition often involves unscalable, hands-on efforts, such as personalized outreach and direct engagement. While these methods can be time-intensive, they are crucial for validating the business model and building an initial user base.\n\n5: Overcome Challenges\n\nLaunching a business in such a short timeframe is not without its challenges. Technical issues, such as database integration and automation workflow errors, required troubleshooting and persistence. These obstacles underscored the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills in the startup process.\n\nOperational challenges also arose, including managing outreach campaigns and responding to user inquiries. These tasks demanded significant time and effort but were essential for securing initial customers and establishing a foundation for growth. Overcoming these hurdles required a combination of strategic planning, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from setbacks.\n\n6: Measure Results\n\nDespite the challenges, the project achieved profitability within the 72-hour timeframe. Two sales were made, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, resulting in a profit of $238. This outcome demonstrated the feasibility of launching a profitable no-code AI business quickly and efficiently. By focusing on a specific problem and using the right tools, it is possible to achieve tangible results in a short period.\n\nTools and Platforms That Made It Possible\n\nThe success of this project was made possible by a variety of tools and platforms, each playing a crucial role in different aspects of the business:\n\nAI and Automation: Make.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.\n\nMake.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API. No-Code Development: Bolt.\n\nBolt. Database and Authentication: Supabase.\n\nSupabase. Branding: Luca, Coolors, Namecheap.\n\nLuca, Coolors, Namecheap.

Bonus bets can be split into multiple wagers. \u2696\ufe0f FanDuel legal states AZ, CO, CT, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS (retail), NC, NJ, NY, NV, OH, PA, TN, VA, VT, WA, WV, WY and Washington, D.C. \u2705 Last verified Jan. 2, 2025\n\nFanDuel promo code: How to claim your $250 sportsbook bonus\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook doesn\u2019t believe in the build-up. It delivers a gigantic welcome bonus for sports bettors before the new year is even a full day old.\n\nNew users can sign up and claim a $250 sportsbook bonus if their first $5 wager wins. That\u2019s a huge payout on what could be a bet with the shortest of odds. Follow the instructions below to claim the offer:\n\nClick our FanDuel promo code to reach the correct registration page. Choose your state and fill in the required fields. No code is necessary if you register using our link. Pick a source for your first deposit and add at least $5 to your new account. Find a bet you love and wager $5 on it.\n\nThe odds on your first bet don\u2019t matter, so you can be pickier than usual. If you win your bet, you will receive your $250 bonus in a lump sum. You can bet all $250 at once or break it into smaller bets, such as five $50 bets or 25 $10 bets.\n\nWhatever you choose, use the entire bonus within seven days or what\u2019s left over will expire.\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook existing user promos\n\nThe bonuses don\u2019t stop once you have used all of your FanDuel welcome offer. All FanDuel users can grab one of many daily promotions to enhance their sports betting experience. Here are a few examples of what is available:\n\nProfit boosts: Get enhanced odds on select betting markets.\n\nNo sweat bets: If your bet loses, receive a bonus bet to try again with house money.\n\nReferral bonus: Invite your friend, and you\u2019ll each get a $75 bonus ($50 sportsbook + $25 casino).\n\nHow to use your FanDuel bonus bets for Notre Dame vs. Georgia\n\nAlthough FanDuel requires you to win your first wager to claim the bonus, it takes away almost every other restriction. So if you\u2019re careful, you could make claiming the bonus much easier than usual.\n\nFor instance, you don\u2019t have to wager on the Notre Dame vs. Georgia point spread. Georgia is a 1.5-point favorite so the game could be close. In some cases, you could just wager on the moneyline of a big favorite. That\u2019s not as strong of a pick in the Sugar Bowl, so I wouldn\u2019t do that.\n\nInstead, look to one of the many alternate totals offered by FanDuel. The main over/under is 45.5 points, but FanDuel gives you choices at other totals with differing odds. You can choose over 16.5 points or under 74.5 points.\n\nI like taking the over at 16.5 points. The odds are so short that your winnings on a $5 wager will be negligible, but all you need is 17 combined points and you\u2019ll be swimming in your $250 bonus."

In terms of departure from normal temperatures, the coldest weather will actually be south of us, but it will be plenty chilly here.\n\nA storm system that brought rain to the area the middle part of the week will be in northern Quebec at the same time a new massive ocean storm starts developing hundreds of miles to our east this weekend. This upper-level pattern is going to pull down much colder air than we saw at the end of December and the start of the new year.\n\nWith the new year and a new month upon us, our first weekend of January is looking calm and tranquil \u2014 although it will be cold. If you\u2019re looking to partake in outdoor activities, at least you won\u2019t have to worry about any snow or ice.\n\nTemperatures on Friday will be mostly in the 30s across New England. Boston Globe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday will be the least cold day with temperatures reaching the mid- to upper 30s, but the wind will make it feel a lot colder. Morning wind chills will be in the upper teens to 20s.\n\nLook for highs only reaching around 30 degrees on Saturday and Sunday. The wind will continue to be gusty throughout the weekend, knocking wind chills back into the teens and perhaps even single digits first thing in the morning.\n\nWind chills on Saturday will keep temperatures feeling bitterly cold. Boston Globe\n\nTemperatures continue to trend down with Boston barely reaching the freezing mark on Saturday, with colder temps north and west. Boston Globe\n\nThe cold will cause an icy layer on many lakes and ponds, although it will not be at its required 4 inches or greater depth for safety just yet. Older ice is also weaker, so we have to wait for the new ice to form and grow for the greatest support.\n\nSaturday morning will also mark something we call \u201cperihelion.\u201d This is when the Earth is at its closest to the sun as our planet follows its elliptical orbit orbit. This may seem counter-intuitive since it\u2019s the coldest time of the year, but the angle of the sun is much more important than the changing distance throughout the year.\n\nBut the good news is this weekend means our sunrises start getting earlier, so now we are gaining time in both the afternoon and the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeekend breakdown\n\nSouthern New England: Look for breezy and cold conditions throughout the weekend with temperatures around 30 degrees, starting near 20 each morning.\n\nWestern Mass.: Look for partly the mostly cloudy skies this weekend with temperatures in the 20s. The winds will continue to be gusty especially in the afternoon both days.\n\nCape and Islands: Look for blustery conditions both Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures will reach near freezing but start in the 20s each morning.\n\nNorthern New England: Wind will be the main weather feature this weekend along with colder temperatures. Readings will be in the 20s during the day and single digits and teens at night."

Projects are also becoming more complex, thanks to the increasing integration of emerging technologies like AI, heightened regulatory requirements, and the necessity for adaptability in volatile economies.\n\nIt is imperative that project managers keep an eye on what is around the corner in the industry so they are prepared to take advantage of new processes or avoid pitfalls.

Interest in agile is waning, and many agilists say it is dead. Hybrid projects combine elements of one or more project approaches. For decades, project managers have pragmatically blended processes and practices based on context and specific project needs.\n\nHybrid allows project managers to move away from the binary waterfall-agile world to one where patterns of practice include lean, kanban, and DevOps. Successful project managers must make intentional choices when deciding how to execute their projects.\u201d\n\nSEE: Explore the key features and benefits of hybrid project management.\n\nTrend 2: Squad-based teams reduce bureaucracy\n\nJack Skeels, CEO of training firm AgencyAgile\n\n\u201cThe shift to squad-based teams reflects growing dissatisfaction with traditional approaches and the perceived ineffectiveness of agile as it\u2019s often implemented. Leaders and stakeholders are weary of overly complex management structures and expensive project management software tools that fail to deliver meaningful results.\n\nInstead, leaders are embracing simpler, more effective models: small, self-managed teams\u2014typically small squads of five to 15 people. These small teams embody the original spirit of agile by collaborating and getting things done quickly with innovation.\n\nThe model encourages a culture of innovation, collaboration, and responsiveness to change\u2014key traits for businesses competing in fast-paced markets.\u201d\n\nTrend 3: Move to decentralized project management\n\nMolly Beran, founder of project management consultancy Projects By Molly\n\n\u201cI expect to see a lot of organizations re-thinking their approach to creating centralized Project Management Offices. In the past few years, PMOs have been all the rage\u2014companies rush to set them up, build templates and processes, and then usually start to see them slowly wither.\n\nWhy? There are many reasons, of course, but I find that one of the most prevalent reasons is that while there is a rush to stand-up tools and processes, there are rarely enough people skilled in project management to actually use the tools and get the work done.\n\nAlso, in the rush to set up an office, it\u2019s really typical for companies to lose sight of their larger strategic or organizational priorities. In a sense, they get so caught up in creating a centralized PMO that they forget why it exists in the first place\u2014to get the work done that best aligns with the strategic priorities of an organization.\n\nI predict that in 2025 and beyond, companies will start pulling back on centralized PMOs and go back to more decentralized project management, where each department or area has in place experts who understand the core business processes, and also get asked to manage projects.\u201d\n\nSEE: Read TechRepublic\u2019s guide to the top project management certifications.\n\nTrend 4: Focus on AI literacy among project managers\n\nCornelius Fichtner, president of Project Management PrepCast and host of The Project Management Podcast\n\n\u201cProject managers should experience a \u2018rude awakening\u2019 as they recognize the limitations of their current generative AI interactions. The difference between successful and struggling projects hinges primarily on the project manager\u2019s depth of AI understanding.\n\nMany project managers forget that they not only need to use AI on their projects, but they will also be asked to lead projects intended to bring AI capabilities to various departments in their company. They need a really broad and solid understanding of what AI is and can do in order to serve stakeholders from marketing and finance as these departments are augmented with AI.\u201d\n\nSEE: 9 Best AI Project Management Tools for 2024\n\nTrend 5: Accelerated job training through AI\n\nJustin Tan, IT Project Management Office leader at Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\n\u201cImagine AI systems that can instantly generate comprehensive project plans based on the context and conditions, predict potential risks with greater accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and provide contextual decision support that historically required years of professional experience.\n\nJunior professionals without extensive traditional experience will leverage such AI-powered platforms to access institutional knowledge and best practices, effectively compressing years of learning into actionable recommendations\u2014accelerating learning and project execution capabilities.\n\nFrom my experience playing a key role in leading digital transformation initiatives, the most successful organizations will be those that strategically integrate AI not as a replacement for human intelligence, but as a collaborative tool that amplifies human potential.\u201d\n\nSEE: Read more artificial intelligence coverage from TechRepublic.\n\nTrend 6: Resource management software grows in importance\n\nMichele Badie, Professional Development Strategist at Skills Recharged\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue skills-centric resource management discussions, and action plans to connect the right skills to the right tasks while ensuring teams thrive and stay on task. Real-time tools\u2014for example, resource planning software, AI-driven allocation, employee well-being, and collaboration and communication tools\u2014will support making resource allocation seamless.\n\nAt the same time, project managers, as integral parts of the process, will focus on balancing workloads to prioritize mental health and job satisfaction. In 2025, there will continue to be an amplified focus on not just getting the work done\u2014it\u2019s about ensuring your people avoid decision fatigue or burnout and succeed in their roles, too.\u201d\n\nSEE: TechRepublic Premium\u2019s Mental Health Policy.\n\nWill project managers be replaced by AI?\n\nAI is unlikely to replace project managers entirely, but it is reshaping their roles. Research indicates that while AI can automate administrative tasks like scheduling, data collection, and reporting, it lacks severely in other human elements that are essential for effective project management.\n\nThese human elements include making decisions and empathy, which assists with team motivation and conflict resolution\u2014two things project managers do almost daily.\n\nProfessor Adam Boddison, the Chief Executive of Association for Project Management, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cHybrid work environments demand stronger digital communication and leadership skills, while sustainability and diversity initiatives are becoming integral to organisational strategies. Project management is, in effect, future-state planning.\n\n\u201cWith APM research showing that over 50% of businesses anticipate an increase in the number of projects they undertake over the next three years, the importance of the project profession is clear. The role of the skilled project professional will be pivotal across all industries.\u201d\n\nIt has been predicted that 25 million new project professionals will be needed by 2030 to keep up with industry demand. Check out TechRepublic\u2019s guide on how to become a project manager to find out whether the role would suit you."

            "article_content": "The legal battle between Elon Musk and OpenAI has intensified, with the billionaire expanding his lawsuit to include federal claims of unfair competition. In a bold move, Musk has also added Microsoft, a key investor in OpenAI, to the list of defendants, alongside other prominent names in the tech world.\n\nA Rift Over OpenAI\u2019s Mission\n\nElon Musk has long criticized OpenAI for veering away from its original mission as a nonprofit organization focused on making artificial intelligence accessible for public benefit. Musk claims that, back in 2015, OpenAI\u2019s founders, including Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, convinced him to co-found and fund the organization under the premise of creating a nonprofit entity to counterbalance tech giants like Google.\n\nMusk alleges that OpenAI promised to make its AI technologies available \u201cfreely to the public,\u201d a commitment he now accuses the organization of abandoning. This dissatisfaction led Musk to resign from OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018. Since then, he has been vocal about the close ties between OpenAI and Microsoft, frequently raising concerns about the startup\u2019s trajectory toward profit-driven operations.\n\nIn August, Musk revived his legal action against OpenAI after withdrawing it briefly in July. The latest amendment to his lawsuit escalates the dispute, drawing additional parties into the fray.\n\nMicrosoft in the Spotlight\n\nThe updated lawsuit, filed in federal court in Oakland, California, accuses Microsoft and OpenAI of illegally trying to monopolize the generative AI market, estimated to be worth $157 billion. Musk\u2019s legal team contends that their actions were designed to eliminate competition, with exclusive licensing agreements stifling rivals.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Musk has also named Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder and a former OpenAI board member, and Deannah Templeton, a former vice president at Microsoft, as defendants. According to the filing, \u201cNo company in history has transitioned from a nonprofit organization to a $157 billion market-dominating force so swiftly.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to void OpenAI\u2019s licensing agreements with Microsoft and demands that both entities relinquish what Musk terms \u201cill-gotten gains.\u201d OpenAI dismissed the claims, calling them \u201cunfounded and disproportionate.\u201d Microsoft, which has reportedly invested $14 billion in OpenAI, declined to comment.\n\nAllegations of Antitrust Violations\n\nThe amended lawsuit also accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of breaching antitrust laws by tying investment opportunities to restrictive agreements that excluded competitors. It argues that their licensing deals constituted an unapproved merger, further consolidating their influence in the burgeoning AI market.\n\nIn addition to Musk\u2019s xAI company, the lawsuit lists Shivon Zilis, a former OpenAI board member and current executive at Neuralink, as a co-complainant. Zilis, who stepped down from OpenAI\u2019s board in 2023 after voicing concerns over internal agreements, is described in the filing as an \u201cinjured employee\u201d under California corporate law. Her complaints reportedly align with Musk\u2019s assertions about the organization\u2019s direction.\n\nMusk\u2019s Expanding Influence in Politics\n\nAs the legal saga unfolds, Musk\u2019s role in the political arena is also growing. The billionaire has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to co-lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. The department\u2019s goal is to reduce regulatory excess, eliminate unnecessary spending, and streamline bureaucracy\u2014a mission aligned with Musk\u2019s ethos of disruption and innovation.\n\nMusk\u2019s political influence, bolstered by his financial support for Trump\u2019s campaign, could have implications for his ongoing battles with OpenAI and Microsoft. Leveraging his elevated position, Musk may seek to influence tech policy and regulation, potentially shaping the future of AI development and governance.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAs this legal and political drama unfolds, the stakes are high not just for Musk, OpenAI, and Microsoft, but for the entire artificial intelligence industry. The case raises critical questions about the balance between innovation, ethical responsibility, and market dominance. For now, the spotlight remains on Musk, whose fight against OpenAI continues to reshape the conversation around AI and its potential impact on society.\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nRate this post"

Read More\n\nSyrian opposition fighters celebrate after the Syrian government collapsed in Damascus, Syria, on December 8, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nThe Ukraine-Russia war that began in February 2022 led to a series of conflicts for various reasons in different parts of the world, including Israel, Gaza, Syria, Sudan and Myanmar, taking a huge toll on not only the stakeholders, but the world at large.\n\nWill 2025 continue to witness the rage or will be there an end to this violence? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nrelated stories\n\nWhat Is The Status Of The Gaza War?\n\nGaza Strip, which is small territory along the Mediterranean Sea, became the hotbed of violence in October 2023 when Palestinian extremist group Hamas unleashed attacks on Israel, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities in the area.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said. Israel\u2019s military said it \u201celiminated\" Hamas fighters.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has warned that Hamas will \u201csuffer blows of a magnitude not seen in Gaza for a long time\" if it doesn\u2019t release the remaining hostages and stop firing at Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military has stated quite often that it only targets militants and has blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army said it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nSome 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been displaced, many of them multiple times, due to the war.\n\nThe US and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in November issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former defence chief Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe war has impacted Israeli citizens. More than 82,000 Israelis moved abroad in 2024 and 33,000 people immigrated to the country, Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics said. Another 23,000 Israelis returned after long periods abroad.\n\nBut there is a chance that the war could end this year. Donald Trump had told Netanyahu that he wanted the conflict to end before he returns to the White House on January 20. After he was declared a winner, Trump had said in his address that he wants all wars to end.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will keep hold of Gaza for the \u201cforeseeable future\" after the war ends. He also wants the Palestinian Authority to take a role in Gaza\u2019s administration.\n\nJosef Federman, Associated Press\u2019 news director (Israel-Palestinian territories-Jordan), said there are signs that the war is in its final stages. \u201cBut even if it ends, I don\u2019t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that\u2019s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think.\"\n\nIs Putin Ending The Ukraine Conflict?\n\nExperts predict that Russian President Vladimir Putin could up the ante against Ukraine as he would be set to reclaim the territories that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told the Mirror that Putin is unlikely to be satisfied with a peace deal imposed by the West and aim for further expansion, targeting post-1997 NATO states.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, Putin will advance his strategic plan to undermine and force post-1997 NATO states, including Poland, Finland, and the Baltic nations, to leave the alliance,\" Glees warns. He told the Mirror that this \u201cbig grab\" could cause a global war.\n\nWith Trump promises his electorate to end the Ukraine war within a day by negotiating a peace deal, reports suggest his plan may embolden Putin rather than deter him. Trump proposed deal includes freezing the current front lines, establishing a buffer zone, and delaying Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership by 20 years.\n\nAs per Kyiv Independent, Putin had said Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and disavowed its goal of joining the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin has also demanded that Ukraine acknowledge Crimea and Sevastopol as Russian territory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,\" Putin had said at the time.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, and since then, Moscow has made steady gains in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops have taken over 30 square kilometres of Kyiv\u2019s territory.\n\nUkraine had responded to Russia\u2019s offensive by using US long-range Army Tactical Missile System. Though experts insist that Kyiv being given permission to use these missiles is not a game changer, Moscow has responded by lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term was due to end in May 2024 has been extended due to martial law. He would need to be re-elected for Russia to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, Putin had said.\n\nSamya Kullab, Associated Press correspondent in Ukraine, told the Guardian that the situation is far different from when the war began. \u201cThe jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly,\" Kullab wrote.\n\nEuropean Union leaders believe Ukraine needs to hold on and maybe placate Trump to open ideas for negotiations with Russia. The EU will have to continue to sanction individuals and companies in Russia.\n\nWho Is In Charge In Syria After The Government Collapse?\n\nIn Syria, protests began against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, who came to power in 2000. Pro-democracy protesters during the peak of Arab Spring in 2011 took to the streets in Syria, calling for the ouster of the dictator. But the movement was crushed by Assad\u2019s forces, leading to the establishment of small militias and armed opposition groups from the Syrian military.\n\nAs anti-establishment forces grew, the Syrian allies stepped up support. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s proxy Hezbollah helped the armed rebel groups, while Russia bolstered the Syrian Air Force with warplanes. Soon, al-Qaeda started taking interest in the cause of Syria\u2019s opposition forces. By 2014, extremists, including ISIS swept the country.\n\nThe US then created the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 comprising Kurdish fighters \u2013 to eliminate ISIS without confronting the Syrian regime. The SDF fought against the ISIS and ended their territorial existence in Syria. In 2020, Russia and Turkey agreed to a ceasefire in the opposition-held region of Idlib.\n\nIn 2024, the war was triggered by a coalition of rebel forces calling themselves the Military Operations Command. They swept through the villages outside Aleppo\u2014the second largest city in Syria \u2013 and eventually seized Damascus \u2013 the capital city.\n\nAssad has vowed that Syria will continue \u201cto defend its stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their supporters\". The defence ministry said it was preparing to launch a counteroffensive. \u201cJoint Syrian-Russian warplanes\" have intensified precise strikes on rebel positions, killing and wounding dozens, it said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts have already expressed scepticism over Assad\u2019s chances. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank told CBS, \u201cAleppo seems to be lost for the regime. And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"\n\nThey cited the fact that Russia was heavily distracted by the war in Ukraine and that Iran and Hezbollah were left weakened by their conflict against Israel.\n\nThe experts said the rebels had been biding their time for years. \u201cThis has to do with geopolitics and local opportunity,\" Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told The Washington Post. \u201cThe rebellion at large had regrouped, rearmed and retrained for something like this.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden had called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\" but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\" and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\" but the US would assess their actions.\n\nExperts predict that West Asia could see massive changes in 2025. A US official told CNN that developments in Syria mark the collapse of \u201cIran\u2019s artifice\" across the region.\n\nWhatever happens in Syria will have a major impact on its neighbours Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, Iran lost its pillars in the Axis of Resistance. After the heavy blow that Hezbollah suffered at the hands of Israel, the fall of Assad is a fatal strike on Iran\u2019s influence efforts in the Middle East,\" Danny Citrinowicz, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East Programs, told Council for Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nWhat\u2019s The Status Of Civil War In Sudan?\n\nThe Sudanese civil war between two military factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in September 2024. It started as a power rivalry between the military heads of the SAF and the RSF, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hamdan Dagalo respectively. What began as a conflict in the capital city of Khartoum has spread to Omdurman, Bahri, Port Sudan, El Fasher and the Port Sudan cities, as well as the Darfur and Kordofan states.\n\nThe war is taking place as both warring parties are adamant about gaining ground and legitimising their power. The SAF, which came to power through a coup in 2021, claims to be the legitimate government, with the UN just about recognising them. However, the RSF has territorial gains around the capital and other war zones. It opposes the SAF\u2019s efforts to represent Sudan internationally, claiming legitimacy. The RSF, a former Arab militia known as Janjaweed, seeks alliances from several Arab countries to support its claim to power.\n\nSudan has been under the UN arms embargo, since the 2004 Darfur crisis, which has been now been extended for another year. However, the embargo has not blocked the flow of weapons. A Human Rights Watch report in July claimed that the warring parties have been using armed drones, anti-tank guided missiles, truck-mounted multi-barrel rocket launchers, and mortar munitions produced by companies registered in China, Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the UAE.\n\nAround nine rounds of peace talks led by the US and Saudi Arabia have been held, but all failed in the initial stage. The latest round of US-led peace talks was held in Geneva, Switzerland, on August 14, 2024. But, neither of the warring parties attended.\n\nAny new administration ruling Sudan would be a challenge to the internationally recognised and army-led national government which was forced out of Khartoum last year and now operates on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. A group of civilian politicians and armed group leaders have agreed to set up a \u201cpeace government\", RSF members told Reuters.\n\nThey said it would be civilian-led, independent of the RSF and set up to replace the government in Port Sudan which they accused of prolonging the war.\n\nThe civil has impacted several regions, with more than 2 million people seeking shelter in neighbouring Chad, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The refugee camps are overflown and have raised concerns in Europe that many will attempt to reach the continent. In February, dozens of Sudanese drowned when a migrant boat capsized along the Tunisia-Italy route. A lack of law and order has triggered ethnic clashes along the South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea borders. More than 100 deaths were reported in ethnic violence in the Abiey region, a disputed land between Sudan and South Sudan, according to the UN.\n\nThere is a fear that the military rivals would divide Sudan, leading to a similar situation in Libya. Unlike Ukraine and Gaza, the Sudanese war has not gained international traction, but the repercussions have been the same \u2014 fatalities, fear and destroyed livelihood.\n\nWhere Does Myanmar Stand In 2025?\n\nThe ongoing civil war in Myanmar, since the military toppled the civilian government in 2021, has killed more than 50,000 people and displaced around 3 million.\n\nThe fighting between the junta and armed resistance groups in the first two years of the war led to a stalemate while 2024 saw the military on the back foot. With the active Ukraine and Middle East wars, violence in Myanmar conflict has been received global attention.\n\nIn February 2021, the Myanmar\u2019s military staged a coup to overthrow the civilian government\u2014on the same day the parliament is set to swear in the winners of the 2020 election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won by a landslide. As a result, international condemnation and pro-democracy protests swept across the country, with the junta responding with a brutal crackdown. Nearly 500 were killed in the first two months of the coup.\n\nIn May 2021, the National Unity Government (NUG), comprising ousted lawmakers, protesters and ethnic minorities, announced its armed wing \u2013 the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF). But in August, Min Aung Hlaing named himself the Prime Minister, and announced a potential extension to the state of emergency.\n\nIn 2022, resistance forces become more united, with many PDF units and ethnic armies forming partnerships to launch joint attacks against junta troops.\n\nIn October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of ethnic armies, launched \u2018Operation 1027\u2019, seizing control of key areas from the military, marking a key victory for the resistance and a turning point in the war.\n\nIn January 2024, China brokered ceasefire between junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the junta announced mandatory conscription for all men between 18 and 35 years old and all women between 18 and 27 in February.

A catastrophe around the world was predicted to take place in 2025, as according to Baba Vanga. On the other hand, Nicholas Aujula, 38 years old, is also known to have given very dire predictions that came true when he said COVID-19 will erupt in 2018, the hypnotherapist from London shared his visions for what might happen in 2025.Aujula confirmed to be a believer in reincarnation, based on which the experiences gathered for centuries direct his psychic development. He described death as transformation, not something that ends or marks the disappearance of the soul. The process of death allows the soul to go forward by taking on a new form. This lets him, Aujula added, experience things before it occurs and explain it to humankind.Aujula has forecast that the year 2025 will be one of worldwide turmoil. According to him, religious and nationalist violence will start the Third World War. In his opinion, political murders have become commonplace, evil, and violence prevail over the world, and compassion and peace are as rare as grains of sand. Such predictions present a very grim picture of a world mired in conflict and suffering.Apart from political instability, Aujula feels that science will make giant leaps, particularly in medical technology. He feels that organs will be grown in the laboratory and this will be a breakthrough in medical science. But this will be balanced with natural disasters, he says, where heavy rain will cause widespread flooding, displacing millions of people and destroying homes. He further warns that flooding of whole cities by rising sea levels will exacerbate the calamity even worse than the cause created by environmental change.According to Aujula, the political meltdown of the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is an omen, while inflation keeps steadily on the increase across the entire globe. Meanwhile, amidst the pandemonium, he expects Prince William and Prince Harry will again reconcile once in a blue moon. In this regard, their estrangement will also soon be rewarded. All these prophesies hint at a mixture of political predictions with personal ones around the international scene.Nicholas Aujula claims that his psychic ability has its root in a profound experience he had as a teenager. He says at the age of 17, he had a dream in which he was shown things that were to happen by an unknown figure. He asserts this experience initiated him into psychic prediction. Aujula's prophecies have gained fame over the years, and several of his prophecies have already been seen to be correct, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, Donald Trump winning the presidency, and the COVID-19 pandemic.Aujula also claims that he was in a coma for some time after waking up from it, during which he started experiencing visions of his past lives. He believes these experiences have contributed to his ability to predict future events. He says that he has lived a previous life as an ancient queen of Egypt, a tailor in China, a nun in the Himalayas, and even as a lion in Africa. Such is his faith in reincarnation, the premise for his predictions: \"The soul never dies,\" he claims. \"It just comes back to be reborn in some form.\""

            "article_content": "The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act is designed to regulate the behaviour of major digital firms with significant market power in the U.K.\n\nThe legislation grants the Competition and Markets Authority new powers to impose requirements on tech companies with \u201cStrategic Market Status,\u201d reminiscent of the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d organisations that must abide by the E.U.\u2019s Digital Markets Act.\n\nHowever, while these laws share similarities, the new legislation is less one-size-fits-all: Under the DMCCA, the CMA can apply bespoke regulations, so-called \u201cConduct Requirements,\u201d to companies with SMS to address their specific issues.\n\nIssues might relate to:\n\nThe DMCCA was created in response to a report published in 2019 by the Digital Competition Expert panel, chaired by Jason Furman an economic policy professor at Harvard University and former chief economist to U.S. President Barack Obama. It contained recommendations to open up digital markets in the U.K.\n\nWhile the DMCCA was greenlit in 2020, due to various delays, it was only passed by Parliament in April 2023 and given Royal assent in May 2024. It is expected to come into force in January 2025.\n\nSEE: Google Abusing Dominant Position in Ad Tech Sector, Says U.K. Government\n\nWhat is the aim of the Act?\n\nThe DMCCA aims to improve competitive conditions in digital markets by enabling interventions that encourage investment, innovation, and growth in all U.K. tech companies, ultimately providing consumers with access to the best possible technologies for them.\n\nThe CMA stated in a press release that the legislation will enable it to investigate Google, Apple, and other large tech firms\u2019 potentially anticompetitive practices \u201cmore holistically.\u201d The rules \u201cwill build on and leverage its experience in areas it has already studied, such as mobile ecosystems, which includes app stores.\u201d\n\nIn a January 2024 interview, Sarah Cardell, CEO of the CMA, said: \u201cThe new regime is specifically designed to keep pace with developments in fast-moving digital markets, complementing our existing competition and consumer protection powers.\n\n\u201cThe DMCC Bill will establish a very targeted approach to address the substantial and entrenched market power of a small number of firms. This will ensure that challenger firms can bring forward genuinely disruptive and exciting new innovations that will create great new products for consumers.\u201d\n\nWho will the Act impact?\n\nAfter a formal investigation, the CMA will designate \u201ca very small number\u201d of firms as having SMS and, therefore will be subject to the DMCCA. These firms must have:\n\nA \u201csubstantial and entrenched market power in a digital activity that is linked to the UK.\u201d\n\nA \u201cposition of strategic significance.\u201d\n\nA global turnover of more than \u00a325 billion or a U.K. turnover of more than \u00a31 billion.\n\nSMS designations will be reviewed a minimum of every five years. According to Cardell, between three and four will be launched in the first year of the new regime.\n\nIn August, the CMA rejected Google\u2019s proposed policy changes regarding purchases made within apps listed on its Play Store, which had spurred an investigation. This suggested that the company would be one of the first to achieve SMS because, if the CMA accepted the changes, it would be limited in what actions it could take under the DMCCA.\n\nWhat will the Act enable the U.K. government to do?\n\nThe DMCCA gives new enforcement powers to a new group established inside the CMA called the Digital Markets Unit. It counts existing CMA directors and a former Ofcom exec as members.\n\nThe DMU will draft a unique set of \u201cconduct requirements\u201d for each company that has SMS. They must abide by these behaviours even before exhibiting anti-competitive practices to prevent them from ever occurring. This approach differs from other competition laws, where remedies are delivered after an investigation uncovers a violation.\n\nSEE: Regulator CMA to Scrutinize Microsoft and Other Cloud Service Providers in the UK\n\nAs well as conduct requirements, the DMU can make \u201cpro-competition interventions\u201d that will actively address a company\u2019s adverse effects on competition that stem from its disproportionate market power.\n\nExamples of how the DMU might support healthy competition in digital markets include:\n\nPreventing bundling or tying of products or services.\n\nPreventing self-preferencing of products or services.\n\nMandating competitor access to data or functionality.\n\nRequiring interoperability of products or services.\n\nRequiring \u201cchoice screens\u201d that allow users to select their preferred default apps or services over the company\u2019s own.\n\nRequiring transparency concerning aspects of companies\u2019 algorithms.\n\nRequiring fairer trading terms.\n\nFurthermore, the DMU will require SMS companies to report any merger valued at least \u00a325 million and a U.K. connection.\n\nWhat are the penalties for non-compliance?\n\nUnder the DMCCA, the CMA is empowered to impose penalties for failures such as non-compliance with enforcement or final orders. Businesses and individuals may be required to produce testimonies or other documentation to aid the DMU\u2019s work. Cardell said the CMA has legal obligations to maintain confidentiality regarding information and whistleblowers.\n\nFor fixed penalty amounts, businesses can face fines of up to \u00a330,000 or 1% of their turnover. For penalties calculated at a daily rate incurred by individuals, the maximum is \u00a315,000 or 5% of total turnover per day of non-compliance.\n\nSEE: Data (Use and Access) Bill: What Is It and How Does It Impact UK Businesses?\n\nCardell said that the CMA \u201chope(s) that in many cases we will be able to secure timely and beneficial changes without resorting to formal action,\u201d and instead resolve disputes by engaging directly with SMS firms.\n\nWhat are critics saying about the Act?\n\nDespite mostly positive feedback in a government consultation in late 2024, the Act has not been met with universal acclaim. Critics are concerned that, instead of complying with the CMA, tech companies will simply exclude the U.K. from the rollout of new products.\n\nEvidence of exclusion has already taken place in Europe. For example, Apple will not be making its new suite of generative AI capabilities, Apple Intelligence, available on devices in the E.U. initially, citing \u201cregulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nSEE: Apple Intelligence EU: Potential Mac Release Amid DMA Rules\n\nRegulatory pushback may have also contributed to the delayed arrival of Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot and Meta withholding its future AI products from Europe.\n\nThere are concerns that the CMA could use its power to arbitrarily create bespoke regulations for different companies, making it more difficult for them to comply. But, Cardell said that the principles the Act is based on fit under four themes; firstly, taking a targeted, evidence-based and proportionate approach.\n\nThe other themes are ensuring the regime complements the CMA\u2019s existing tools, engaging with various stakeholders, including Big Tech, and promoting competition to deliver better user outcomes. However, choice screens, interoperability, and sideloading can actually worsen the user experience through a phenomenon known as feature creep.\n\nThe Act can prevent any potentially anticompetitive merger where one party has a 33% market share in the U.K. and a turnover of around \u00a3350 million, and the target company is U.K.-based. According to law firm Linklaters, \u201cit will be hard in most cases to establish that an acquirer does not have a 33% share on some cut of the market or permutation of supply that the CMA could use to establish jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, the CMA provisionally found competition concerns in the mobile browsers market stemming from Apple and Google\u2019s duopoly. It recommended mitigations that could be imposed under the DMCCA when it comes into force. However, Apple told TechRepublic that such mitigations \u201cwould undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Ever since Microsoft first introduced its Arm-based Copilot Plus laptops in June, I\u2019ve been wondering when we might see Copilot Plus features appear on desktop PCs. Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

            "article_content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a guest post from Ang Troy, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nMost IT organizations have cloud services in place or have made conscious decisions regarding its adoption. Such decisions may include adopting the cloud quickly and wholly, to proceed methodically with cloud services or to delay for a period of time.\n\nIn any of these strategies, IT organizations face major obstacles building, deploying, consuming, managing, securing and integrating cloud services.\n\nThe adoption of cloud computing is multidimensional, and it must be run like a multiyear program, not a fixed-duration project. As a result, the complexity of cloud adoption requires at least one accountable architectural leader to guide the organization through the transformation. This is the task of a role that many IT organizations are now finding to be mandatory: the enterprise cloud architect.\n\nMany organizations can clearly point to their lead enterprise cloud architect, but others have yet to formally name this individual or have piled the cloud responsibilities onto an already overburdened enterprise architect. Organizations that are the most successful have formally assigned cloud architecture responsibilities to ensure that a single, accountable architect is in charge.\n\nWhat is an enterprise cloud architect?\n\nAn enterprise cloud architect is responsible for the cloud computing initiatives in an organization and for directing the architectural aspects of the cloud team across all aspects of IT and the business.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect should be the foundation of a cloud center of excellence, or what will become the CCOE \u2014 the enterprise architecture function that governs the organization\u2019s approach to the cloud.\n\nCommon alternative names for a CCOE include: the cloud business office, the cloud transformation office, the cloud brokerage team and the cloud enablement team.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is usually a senior individual contributor who serves as the leader of the CCOE \u2014 or, if there is no cloud EA function, then as the leader of cloud initiatives.\n\nOften, the role of the enterprise cloud architect is largely self-directed, and day-to-day responsibilities are usually fluid. The specific tasks vary, depending on the level of the organization\u2019s cloud maturity and the maturity of its CCOE.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are typically not \u201chands-on.\u201d They will make decisions, but hand off responsibility for their technical implementation to a cloud engineering function. Cloud technical architects may be hands-on, but they are associated with the cloud engineering function, not the CCOE.\n\nWhere cloud sits in the organization\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is the foundation of the CCOE, and may be the only member of this hub in some organizations.\n\nCompanies may not have a structured center of excellence in name, and may rely on the enterprise cloud architect to effectively assume the role of this center. This is a common and acceptable practice, though Gartner recommends building out the CCOE with additional members.\n\nRegardless of the organizational design, the enterprise cloud architect has six key relationships:\n\nAdvisory-level access to senior IT leaders, either directly or through the EA team Direct and collaborative access to senior EA teams Direct and collaborative access to domain architecture teams Collaborative access to technical architects and teams Collaborative access to central function architects and teams Collaborative access to business unit representatives to discern business needs for specific solutions\n\nSkill sets of enterprise cloud architects\n\nDue to the broad applicability of cloud computing in an organization, it\u2019s unlikely that any individual will possess all the skills that the enterprise cloud architect role demands. However, the enterprise cloud architect should possess as many of the desired skills as possible.\n\nWhere a specific skill is lacking, the enterprise cloud architect should be able to collaborate or engage the relevant, resident experts in the organization. For example, if the enterprise cloud architect does not have a skill or strength in IT service management (ITSM), that individual needs to build a strong relationship with an ITSM expert to drive objectives to completion.\n\nAt the core, enterprise cloud architects are enterprise architects. Therefore, they need to have the competencies of good enterprise architects in order to drive business outcomes, empower business partners and develop and build effective architecture disciplines\n\nCloud computing is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d; it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow.\u201d Adopting cloud services is similar to a complex IT program that has no clear end in sight. Guiding cloud adoption requires strong leadership, not just at an executive level, but also at an architectural level.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are paramount to the eventual success of cloud adoption. Organizations should not delay placing the right individual into this crucial IT role."

Her discovery this week puts an end to one of Great Britain\u2019s oldest missing person cases.\n\nFox, now 68, disappeared from Coventry in 1972. On Sunday, West Midlands police released a grainy photo of her from around the time she vanished to the public asking for help one more time. The police stated in their plea that Fox had been living with her parents when she disappeared and could have been in a relationship with a man at the time. They also suggested that she may have moved out of the area.\n\n\u201cWe searched through every piece of evidence we could find and managed to locate a photo of Sheila,\u201d said Detective Sergeant Jenna Shaw, a member of the West Midlands police cold case investigation team.\n\nJust a few hours later, the 52-year-old mystery had finally been solved. Sheila Fox was alive and well and living in another part of the country.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, members of the public reached out to police with information that led to her being found.\n\nCoventry woman who vanished 52 years ago found alive and well https://t.co/7AoZVIUQyD\n\nMystery of Sheila Fox\u2019s disappearance at 16 solved after fresh police appeal A woman who went missing 52 years ago has been found alive and well after police release\u2026 https://t.co/cYMYt2RIuX \u2014 The Protector (@The_Protect0r_) January 1, 2025\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to announce the conclusion of one of West Midlands Police\u2019s longest-running missing person investigations,\u201d a police spokesperson said. \u201cA single photo of Sheila from around the time of her disappearance was found by officers investigating and published on our website and social media. Within hours of the appeal, members of the public got in touch with information which led the team to her.\n\n\u201cSheila was confirmed to be safe and well and living in another part of the country, finally resolving one of the longest running missing person cases we have investigated.\u201d\n\nLast year, a teen boy who vanished almost 30 years ago and was thought to be dead was found in a secret well under a neighbor\u2019s house located just 200 meters away from his own home.\n\nHe had been abducted and held captive until the victim\u2019s family was finally tipped off by the alleged captor\u2019s brother."

            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Ajith, astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, has said.\n\nHe was at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium (RSCP) in Kozhikode on Thursday (January 2) to deliver a lecture demonstration on \u2018Universe: yesterday, today and tomorrow\u2019. It is the first in the \u2018Cosmic Snapshots\u2019 series of lectures being organised by the RSCP.\n\nMr. Ajith pointed out that the concept of a primordial atom, proposed in the early 20th century by Georges Lemaitre, who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, was just a \u201cstory\u201d and not a scientific fact. According to Lemaitre, the universe began with an explosion from a single particle at a specific moment in time. \u201cThe primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. At some point, the universe shrank into one tiny entity. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity with quantum physics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ajith traced the history of our understanding of the universe, starting with Nicolaus Copernicus, who first suggested a sun-centered universe, and Galileo Galilei, who proved it through observations. \u201cGalileo\u2019s discoveries changed how we saw the universe and sparked the age of enlightenment and the Renaissance, leading to modern science and technology,\u201d he said. German astronomer Kepler improved Copernicus\u2019 ideas, discovering that planets move in elliptical orbits. Isaac Newton later proposed that the same force making an apple fall also keeps planets revolving around the Sun.\n\nMr. Ajith highlighted that Newton\u2019s laws of motion are still used today, especially in rocket science. He explained how the sun-centered universe concept evolved, revealing the Sun as just a small part of the Milky Way. Later, astronomers debated whether Earth was part of a single galaxy or many. Edward Hubble then developed a telescope to measure the distance to distant galaxies. Mr. Ajith also mentioned Einstein\u2019s theory, which described gravity not as a force, but as the effect of space-time, a concept he introduced to explain how gravity impacts space and the flow of time."

            "article_content": "Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity has revolutionized our understanding of gravity and the universe. However, it leaves some unanswered questions, particularly about singularities and black holes.\n\nRecent studies suggest quantum mechanics could help resolve these mysteries and offer new insights into the fundamental nature of space-time and black holes.\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein to explain how gravity works.\n\nInstead of thinking of gravity as a force that pulls objects toward each other, like Isaac Newton suggested, Einstein proposed that gravity is the result of massive objects bending the space and time around them.\n\nImagine space and time as a stretchy fabric, and when something heavy, like the Earth or the Sun, sits on it, the fabric bends around it.\n\nThis bending is what we experience as gravity. So, objects like planets and moons move in curved paths because they are following the curves in this \u201cfabric\u201d created by mass.\n\nOne of the most mind-blowing predictions of general relativity is that time isn\u2019t the same everywhere.\n\nTime actually moves slower near a strong gravitational field, like near a planet or a star, and faster in areas with weaker gravity.\n\nThis effect is known as time dilation. It\u2019s something that satellites in space have to account for because they experience time a little differently than we do on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding singularities \u2013 the basics\n\nThe elegant framework of general relativity encounters a critical limitation at singularities \u2013 points in space-time where matter collapses to infinite density, and the curvature of space-time becomes infinitely sharp.\n\nThese singularities arise under extreme gravitational collapse, as shown by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose. When a massive star exhausts its fuel and collapses under its gravity, the result can be a singularity.\n\nAt a singularity, the fundamental laws of physics, as we know them, no longer work. Concepts like time, space, and the behavior of matter lose their meaning, rendering physical predictions impossible.\n\nThis unpredictability would challenge science\u2019s foundation, which relies on consistent, testable laws to explain the universe.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing singularities is, therefore, a major challenge in modern physics.\n\nResearchers aim to find ways to reconcile this breakdown, often looking to quantum mechanics or other advanced theories to fill the gaps left by general relativity.\n\nBlack holes and cosmic censorship\n\nBlack holes, nature\u2019s enigmatic phenomena, may conceal singularities. Their defining feature, the event horizon, prevents anything, including light, from escaping.\n\nAccording to Penrose\u2019s cosmic censorship conjecture, singularities resulting from gravitational collapse remain hidden behind these event horizons, preserving the predictability of physics elsewhere in the universe.\n\nDespite its elegance, cosmic censorship remains unproven. Scientists have found no definitive counterexamples, making it one of the most significant open problems in mathematical physics.\n\nQuantum mechanics and black holes\n\nWhile general relativity focuses on large-scale structures, quantum mechanics governs particles and atoms.\n\nCombining these frameworks to understand black holes has proven complex. Recent research published in the journal Physical Review Letters suggests that Penrose\u2019s conjecture is supported by quantum mechanics.\n\nPhysicists have long speculated about \u201cquantum black holes,\u201d where quantum effects play a significant role. These black holes raise questions about how cosmic censorship applies in the quantum realm.\n\nA potential answer lies in developing a theory of \u201cquantum gravity,\u201d which integrates quantum mechanics with space-time. However, such a theory remains elusive.\n\nAdvances in quantum cosmic censorship\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces new complexities such as negative energy, a phenomenon allowed in quantum mechanics but absent in classical physics.\n\nPenrose\u2019s theorem assumes that all matter has positive energy, so the existence of negative energy introduces scenarios that the theorem does not address.\n\nTo explore these complexities, researchers use a hybrid approach called semi-classical gravity. In this model, the space-time structure still obeys Einstein\u2019s general relativity, but the matter within it is treated according to quantum mechanics.\n\nThis allows scientists to study how quantum effects influence the behavior of space-time and black holes.\n\nFrom this perspective, quantum mechanics might play a role in keeping singularities hidden. The concept, called quantum cosmic censorship, proposes that quantum effects could reinforce the \u201cclothing\u201d of singularities by black hole event horizons.\n\nThis means that quantum mechanics may prevent singularities from becoming observable, thus modifying their behavior and preserving the predictability of the universe.\n\nThe idea builds on Penrose\u2019s original cosmic censorship conjecture but extends it into the quantum realm, offering a potential bridge between classical and quantum physics.\n\nThe energy of space-time\n\nA key to understanding quantum cosmic censorship lies in the Penrose inequality. This mathematical relationship links the mass of space-time to the area of black hole horizons, assuming cosmic censorship holds. In quantum systems, a similar inequality could provide insights.\n\nIn 2019, researchers proposed a quantum Penrose inequality. Building on this, the new study introduced a refined version that applies even in strong quantum effects.\n\nThe research shows that the energy of space-time relates to the combined entropy of black holes and quantum matter, which thus maintains the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nStrengthening theories with quantum mechanics\n\nThe new quantum Penrose inequality strengthens the idea of cosmic censorship. While not a definitive proof, it shows that quantum mechanics reinforces the principles governing black holes and singularities.\n\nThis advance bridges classical and quantum physics, and paves the way for deeper insights into the universe.\n\nAs space-time might end at singularities, quantum mechanics ensures we remain shielded from such extremes, preserving the predictability of our universe.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
