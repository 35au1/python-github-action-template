The previous record was 5.65 inches set on Nov. 1, 1901.\n\nMore flash flooding is possible with more rain and storms in the forecast for Sunday in the Roswell region of eastern New Mexico, the National Weather Service stated.\n\nRoswell, NM flooding rescue efforts\n\nThe New Mexico National Guard said that its troops and other agencies rescued nearly 300 people in the overnight hours, including at least one swift water rope rescue and 38 people who were taken to hospitals.\n\nSearch and rescue efforts continued Sunday morning as water levels remained high in the downtown area, the city of Roswell said in a statement. Flood waters entered many houses and other buildings.\n\nMany vehicles got stuck in flash flood waters with some vehicles swept into the river channel. Other motorists waited to be rescued on top of their vehicles that were covered by water, Roswell authorities reported.\n\nAll roads leading to and from Roswell had been closed due to heavy flooding overnight, New Mexico State Police said.\n\nRescue operations taking place involve the Roswell police and fire departments, the Chaves County Sheriff's Office, county volunteer fire departments and New Mexico State Police and the state's National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard is using light/medium tactical vehicles, known as LMTVs, capable of driving in up to four feet of water to transport residents to safety. There were 57 guardsmen in Roswell as of Sunday morning, the National Guard said in a statement.\n\n\"We feel for the New Mexicans affected by this latest flooding in our state,\" Maj. Gen. Miguel Aguilar, the NM National Guard's adjutant general, said in a statement. \"Because of the previous flooding in Ruidoso, we have the experience and were ready for this. We've worked all night, and continue to work with swift water rescue teams and other partner agencies to help our fellow citizens get to safety.\""

        "article_content": "The holiday season is approaching faster than we're ready for it. Come Christmas, I'll be ready to take a break and travel. This year, I'm going to Montreal and Qu\u00e9bec City.\n\nI started planning for a holiday vacation in September, so I had two to three months to save for it. No matter your time frame, however, you can turn to artificial intelligence for savings advice for your next vacation.\n\nI chose to use ChatGPT to help budget for this vacation, given my generally good experiences with it as an AI \"coach\" in other parts of life. (Though not great as a complex financial advice tool, it's better for simpler, more general advice.)\n\nIf you're using ChatGPT to help plan your vacation, you could also ask questions beyond finances -- like where to go, when to travel and how to find the best deals and affordable options for your budget.\n\nAI, it's adventure time.\n\nPrep your prompt\n\nFor ChatGPT to give good savings recommendations, you need to feed it as much context as possible, including your goals, dates and clear parameters. Specifically, you should share the destination, trip length, desired budget and some info on your current financial situation.\n\nIf you have a financial tracking app, you can download the past three months of your spending activity and upload it into ChatGPT. If you don't, then this could be a good time to start a personal budget.\n\nHere are some budgeting apps to consider, CNET's expert tips on savings and advice on how to stick to your saving goals, as well as some mistakes to avoid when you're saving money.\n\nAlternatively, though it requires more manual labor than using a budgeting app, you could upload the past 30 days of your financial activity into a spreadsheet and group it into categories.\n\nJust always be wary of sharing sensitive personal or financial information with AI tools due to security risks. To avoid ChatGPT knowing too much financial information about me, I'm using estimates for this example.\n\nPrompt #1: \"I'm planning a vacation to Montreal and Qu\u00e9bec City in December. I want to go for the week between Christmas and New Year's (December 26 \u2013 January 2). I want to surprise my wife with the gift for her birthday. I expect the trip will cost approximately $3,000. I want to book in November, so I have two months to save.\n\nHere are some ballpark numbers: I earn $70,000 per year after tax. My monthly take-home pay is approximately $5,830. I aim to put aside 30% of my income for long-term saving and investing, which comes to $1,750, leaving $4,080.\n\nMy monthly expenses include:\n\nRent: $1,315\n\nGroceries: $600\n\nDining out/ordering in: $400\n\nPhone: $125\n\nGym: $33\n\nYoga classes: $80\n\nSubscriptions: $32\n\nLet's allow a buffer of $300 per month for miscellaneous expenses (toiletries, clothes, gifts, Amazon etc.) and spontaneous events, and I'm left with $1,200 per month. Can you help me save more money in the next two months?\"\n\nMake sure you also include your minimum monthly payment for your credit card and any other debt you need to pay down.\n\nChatGPT gave me several strategies to save, including ordering in and dining out less, reducing grocery spending, pausing my yoga classes while saving for this goal, cutting my subscriptions temporarily and limiting spontaneous purchases. Here's some of what it suggested:\n\nScreenshot by Amanda Smith/CNET\n\nBe sure to double check all of ChatGPT's numbers because it's frequently wrong. Choose ChatGPT as a first step, but don't rely on it for financial advice.\n\nGet more granular\n\nYou can get even more granular advice by uploading your restaurant and UberEats receipts to see where you can save on ordering in or asking ChatGPT what types of meals you're spending the most money on (and try to make them yourself at home instead).\n\nOnce your vacation is over, you could also save all the receipts from the trip, load them into ChatGPT and spot spending trends to factor into future trips.\n\nAsk for travel tips\n\nI also wanted to know if ChatGPT had any handy tips for traveling to Montreal/Qu\u00e9bec City during the holidays. The advice was pretty generic, such as booking early and avoiding tourist traps, but it did suggest checking out Passeport MTL for discounted attractions.\n\nI continued to prod to see what ChatGPT could provide non-locals, and it gave me ideas like the cheapest neighborhoods and restaurants to dine in, the BYOB spots to avoid alcohol markups and to drink tap water in Qu\u00e9bec City, given the excellent water quality.\n\nAI won't give you all the answers, but it will inspire ideas on savings -- both before you leave and while you're on vacation. You could even download the ChatGPT app to answer your money and Montreal questions while on the go.\n\nJust remember that whatever info you put into ChatGPT won't necessarily remain confidential. It will be used to train the AI model, so it provides better answers in the future, unless you disable your chat history (though OpenAI still saves it for 30 days). Reputable budgeting apps have a lot more security and may provide better answers than AI at this point.\n\nRead more: Do You Hate Your Budget? Try This Instead"

        "article_content": "AI is transforming many professions and industries, generating considerable hype for Big Tech, and serving as an undeniably powerful tool for research. Setting aside the challenges associated with AI, like hallucinations and how it will impact the job market, it's a massively consequential new area of tech.\n\nSo as you might expect, this potentially revolutionary tool is already being integrated into social media. There are plenty of ways that AI is completely changing how we use these platforms and interact with their apps.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most interesting of those tools.\n\nSEE ALSO: YouTube Music is testing an AI-powered \u2018Ask for music any way you like\u2019 feature\n\nChat with Meta AI in Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp\n\nFor many people, tools like ChatGPT are incredibly useful in day-to-day life, whether it be for research purposes, generating email responses, or just chatting. But you don't have to subscribe to ChatGPT or download any additional apps to chat with an AI-based chatbot. Meta has built Meta AI, its ChatGPT equivalent, directly into all of its major social media services. You can use it directly from the Facebook Messenger app, the Instagram app, or even WhatsApp, chatting with it like you would with any other person.\n\nThe Meta AI chatbot is based on Meta's Llama large language model, a model that Meta is constantly evolving and improving. Unlike models from other companies, Llama is open source (or at least Meta claims it is), and it's gotten a whole lot better over just the past year. Best of all, you don't have to pay for anything to access it. Simply open up one of Meta's messaging platforms and start chatting with the search bar at the top. You can also, for instance, add Meta AI to a WhatsApp conversation, and everyone involved in the chat can see its answers.\n\nAI filters and features in TikTok\n\nTikTok is known for its filters, voice changers, and more \u2013 and the company has been building AI tools to help supercharge your TikTok videos for years now. Filters \u2014 the popular manga filter for instance \u2014 use object-recognition, or change your voice while still sounding completely natural, or add 3D objects to a space captured by your phone\u2019s camera. These are all based on AI, and they\u2019ve yielded some of the most interestingly creative videos on the platform yet. If you\u2019re a creator on TikTok, it\u2019s worth giving them a try. Who knows? They could radically enhance your content.\n\nSnapchat AI Snaps\n\nSnapchat isn't being left out of the AI push. Snapchat launched My AI quite a while ago, allowing you to chat directly with Snapchat's self-built bot. On top of that, the company is using image generation tools to make snaps even more creative. AI snaps allow you to transform snaps or create new ones using AI.\n\nYou'll have to be a Snapchat+ subscriber to take advantage of this feature. If you're a subscriber, you can hit the AI button in the toolbar, then type a prompt or select a preset to create a whole new image. It takes a few seconds for the image to be generated, but it's a neat way to add a little uniqueness to your snaps.\n\nAI translation in Instagram Reels\n\nSoon you'll be able to watch Instagram Reels filmed in other languages as if they were originally filmed in your own language. Instagram is experimenting with a new tool that will use AI to not only translate content in a Reel but also dub and lip-sync the translated text in a voice that simulates the speaker's original voice. If the technology is effective enough, it will make it seem as if there's no translation applied to the Reel at all, just that it was filmed in whatever language you speak. In other words, you won't have to rely on translated captions to be able to follow along with content from creators that don't speak your language.\n\nThe feature isn't out just yet, but Meta is conducting small tests with it, translating Reels between English and Spanish, and it plans to add more languages and more widely release the tool soon."

        "article_content": "The Fenton History Center is helping community members get into the Halloween spirit with two Halloween Spirit Tours set for Oct 26.\n\nThe tours are presented and run by Kaycee Colburn, a Fenton board member, artist, paranormal investigator and spiritual intuitive. Colburn comes from a background of working with the paranormal community, including at places such as the Dunkirk Lighthouse, other similar museums to the Fenton, and recreational locations such as the Haunted Hinsdale House.\n\nThe first tour will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Fenton, 67 Washington Street. The cost for the first tour is $30 for members and $35 for non-members. The second tour is a special Halloween tour from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. for adults 18 and up. The cost for the second tour is $40 for members and $45 for non-members. Additionally, guests are encouraged to come in costume for the second tour, which Colburn said helps to bring people into a different mindset.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the paranormal vibe to the area, see if we can trigger any spirits and enhance the experience for the guests,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the Fenton is haunted, we leave that up to the guests and hope to give them a fun experience.\u201d\n\nColburn said the paranormal is something that is very popular these days and the tour can help give people insights into what they might see on television, along with allowing them to choose for themselves if the paranormal is or is not for them. She added that the tour is good for this time of year when the paranormal is already popular and people are looking for Halloween related things to do.\n\n\u201cPeople are already interested in the Fenton on its own and now they can come in the dark and see it in a different light, which gives a cool Halloween feeling,\u201d Colburn said.\n\nColburn encouraged participants to bring a flashlight, dress warmly, and be open minded, saying that there are a lot of theories surrounding the paranormal and that it is not for everyone. She said the tours are for people to come have fun and are very educational about the paranormal.\n\nThe Fenton has done other Spirit Tours throughout the year, and Colburn thought it was something that could possibly be done again next year after having received good responses this year to previous tours. She said some participants have requested the tours be longer or be overnight, which is something she said they are not currently able to do, but that overall there has been a positive response.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out of the house,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else quite like it locally.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Tours are set to offer a safe Halloween, family friendly, fun event to let people learn more about the paranormal and spiritualist movement. Colburn said the tours are a way to bring information in and discuss the paranormal where in today\u2019s society that cannot always happen as it is labeled as creepy.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where the paranormal was not seen as creepy, including right here in Jamestown,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cSo being able to talk about it this way is cool.\u201d\n\nRegistration for both Oct 26 Spirit Tours is available on the Fenton History Center\u2019s website, fentonhistorycenter.org, under the events tab."

You must take two materials that have the properties that you want and, like making a baby, you must see how to combine them to get exactly the offspring that you want.\n\nMeta (formerly, Facebook), often bashed for cashing-in on data, has now given a meta gift to mankind: tomes of data \u2014 for research into functional (meta) materials.\n\nThe global giant has just released copious amounts of data about behaviour of materials at the atomic level, under its Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) initiative, for free.\n\nThis data can help scientists combine different materials with different desired properties to create something new. Examples of functional materials that can tackle climate change include new catalysts for renewable energy storage, carbon neutral fuels, new sorbents for direct air capture, etc.\n\nCreating such materials is somewhat similar to discovering a drug molecule for disease by trying out different combinations of molecules or making a dish of desired taste, texture and flavour from millions of ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, making meta materials involved playing trial-and-error with millions of data points from thousands of materials. But now, there is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can deliver the goods, however, AI is data hungry.\n\nMeta has provided this food for AI. The OMat24 dataset is a collection of data generated from simulations and calculations on different inorganic materials. This dataset contains information on 118 million atomic structures, whichhas information on three parameters \u2014 total energy (the overall energy of the material\u2019s structure), forces (acting on each atom) and cell stress (indicating how the material could deform under certain conditions.) All this was calculated using \u2018density functional theory\u2019, a quantum mechanics-based method for predicting material properties .\n\n\u201cThe search space of possible materials is enormous and remains a significant challenge for both computational and experimental approaches to material science,\u201d says a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper by scientists at Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group. \u201cIdentifying promising candidates through computational screening with machine learning models offers the potential to dramatically increase the search space and the rate of experimental discovery,\u201d says the paper, written by Luis Borroso-Luque et al.\n\nFAIR scientists took over 400 million core-hours of computing to get the data of 118 million structures labelled with total energy, forces and cell stress. (One CPU core used for one hour is one core-hour.) These parameters give an idea of the stability of materials under given conditions.\n\nNow that there is data on over 118 million atomic structures, one can train an AI model to come up with the best combination of any of them for a desired material."

        "article_content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The 2024 Guardians already want to get to work toward 2025.\n\nJust minutes after their surprising, thrilling run through the playoffs came to an end in a 10th-inning Game 5 loss to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series, the sentiment from several players in a mostly quiet, dejected clubhouse was the work toward next season begins \"tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Guardians insisted for about seven months they could do something special, that they were better than the outside expectations, which mostly pegged them to be a below-.500 team. They were mostly right, as they finished the 2024 postseason three wins shy of the World Series.\n\nThey're hungry for more.\n\n\"No one expected that outside of the people in this clubhouse,\" said starting pitcher Matthew Boyd. \"For a group that I think was the youngest average age in Major League Baseball this year in this clubhouse, to experience that with so many guys in their first couple seasons, it's very powerful and it sets an expectation in the best way possible.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\n\"And knowing the character of these guys, it's cliche in how it sounds, but it starts tomorrow, because this feeling sucks.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the offseason and then the 2025 spring training, the Guardians will have Stephen Vogt in his second year as the club's manager and a young roster that is mostly returning.\n\nHere's everything you need to know heading into the offseason.\n\nWhich Cleveland Guardians players are set for free agency in the 2025 MLB offseason?\n\nStarting pitcher Shane Bieber\n\nStarting pitcher Matthew Boyd\n\nStarting pitcher Carlos Carrasco\n\nStarting pitcher Alex Cobb\n\nCatcher Austin Hedges\n\nRelief pitcher Anthony Gose\n\nBoyd might have really increased his price tag with his impressive showing in October. The Guardians raved about Boyd, both on the field and as a clubhouse presence. Boyd raved about how the Guardians helped him tap into some potential he knew was there. But it'll all come down to price.\n\nAustin Hedges was repeatedly called the glue who held the Guardians clubhouse together. It's likely that his tangible value to the Guardians cannot be quantified. As David Fry said after the Game 5 loss, Hedges could go without a hit, and he'd still be a valuable member of the clubhouse for his veteran leadership.\n\n\"I've told so many people this year, that guy could get zero hits and he's underpaid,\" Fry said. \"What he does for a clubhouse, I don't think there's a number that could be put on it.\"\n\nHedges leaves a lot to desire at the plate. But his defensive work and real value behind the scenes cannot be understated after the Guardians went on such a surprising run. Hedges was credited with being a key part of all of it by several players. Then again, the Guardians will have Bo Naylor back, and Fry should be able to catch again in 2025. But bringing Hedges back and having the extra depth, flexibility and veteran leadership would make a lot of sense.\n\nShane Bieber 2025 offseason outlook, contract, free agency\n\nThe Shane Bieber situation is one to watch.\n\nBieber looked to be rounding back into his Cy Young form, but his 2024 season was cut (very) short, and Tommy John surgery ended his season. It'll likely keep him out for a few weeks or even months into 2025 as well.\n\nIt'll certainly bring his initial price tag down compared to what it could have been in free agency, but the Guardians are likely still priced out unless Bieber is intent on staying in Cleveland to continue his rehab and his work with Cleveland's top-of-the-line pitching department. It's possible Bieber will sign a one- or two-year deal and hope to show he can earn a mega-contract after that. The odds are that it won't be in Cleveland.\n\nGuardians arbitration-eligible players 2025\n\nThe Guardians have nine players eligible for arbitration heading into 2025. The players are listed below along with their 2025 arbitration salary projection via MLB Trade Rumors.\n\nFirst baseman Josh Naylor ($12 million)Center fielder Lane Thomas ($8.3 million)Starting pitcher Triston McKenzie ($2.4 million)Relief pitcher James Karinchak ($1.9 million)Left fielder Steven Kwan ($4.3 million)Relief pitcher Nick Sandlin ($1.6 million)Relief pitcher Sam Hentges ($1.4 million)Relief pitcher Eli Morgan ($1 million)Starting pitcher Ben Lively ($3.2 million)\n\nNaylor and Thomas are in their final year of arbitration eligibility, and both can become free agents after the 2025 season. It's possible that if the Guardians were to make some trades involving veterans, Thomas and/or Naylor could be included, but there are no indications that will be the case just yet. They also may not want to separate the Naylor brothers.\n\nKwan is only at 3.0 years of service time, which is why his salary is a bit lower. Arbitration salaries tend to increase as players get closer to free agency, at least in general. Players become free agents when they eclipse 6.0 years of MLB service time.\n\nKarinchak missed the entire 2024 season (at least in the majors). McKenzie spent most of it in Triple-A Columbus. Hentges is set to miss most of the 2025 season after needing shoulder surgery.\n\nTeams do have the option to non-tender arbitration-eligible players, which would make them free agents.\n\nAfter Tanner Bibee, Guardians have major question marks with 2025 starting rotation\n\nPerhaps the most intrigue with the roster involves the starting rotation, which is a total reversal from what Cleveland has been accustomed to the last several years.\n\nTanner Bibee stepped up to a large degree to lead the rotation, and the Guardians believe he could have Cy Young-contender seasons in his future.\n\nAfter Bibee and Gavin Williams, questions abound. Will Bieber return or leave in free agency? And even if he did return, when can he pitch again? Can McKenzie rediscover his command? Could Logan Allen rework his way back into the rotation? Will Boyd and Lively be back? What about Cobb? Can Joey Cantillo \u2014 who was especially emotional after the ALCS Game 5 loss \u2014 earn a spot every fifth day?\n\nIf the Guardians were to dip into the free agent pool, depending on what their internal options do, bolstering their rotation with a veteran or two could be the way to go. It worked wonders last year, as Boyd and Lively gave the Guardians tremendous returns on investment.\n\nTop MLB free agents 2025\n\nJuan Soto just sent the Yankees to the World Series with his 10th-inning home run in Game 5 of the ALCS, but as of right now he's set to headline the list of free agents around the league this winter.\n\nGuardians top prospects who could make an impact in 2025\n\nThe 2025 season could be to feature a few headliners among the Guardians prospect ranks.\n\nTop prospect Travis Bazzana, the No. 1 overall selection in last June's draft, could potentially hit the major leagues in his first full season in pro ball. Bazzana is a second baseman, but he should be able to easily move positions if he hits well enough to force his way to the majors.\n\nThe Guardians could also get their first glimpse of No. 2-ranked prospect Chase DeLauter in a major-league setting. DeLauter had a tremendous spring in 2024, and could make an impact in right field in Cleveland in 2025.\n\nThe Guardians continue to monitor Daniel Espino's rehab. Espino has an extremely high ceiling thanks to some elite velocity and movement, but he also has an extremely low floor due to his injury history.\n\nWhen does MLB free agency start?\n\nPlayers who are eligible will become free agents the day after the World Series ends. At that time, teams can sign their own free agents. Players can't sign with a new team until 5 p.m. five days after the World Series ends.\n\nWhen is the MLB option deadline?\n\nTeams must exercise player, club or mutual options within five days after the end of the World Series.\n\nWhat is a qualifying offer in Major League Baseball?\n\nA qualifying offer is a one-year deal equal in value to the mean salary of MLB's 125 highest-paid players. This year, that total is set for $21.05 million.\n\nTeams can extend a one-year qualifying offer to their own departing free agents within five days of the conclusion of the World Series. A player must have never received a qualifying offer before, and he must have spent the entire 2024 season on that team's roster.\n\nIf a player rejects the offer and then signs with a new club in free agency, the former team will receive draft pick compensation. The new team that signs the free agent is subject to the loss of at least one draft pick.\n\nWhen does Guardians spring training start?\n\nThe Guardians' first Cactus League game is set for Feb. 22 against the Cincinnati Reds. That game will have some extra intrigue, as Terry Francona is now the Reds manager. Players and catchers normally report around Valentine's Day, but those dates have not yet been set.\n\nWhen is Guardians 2025 Opening Day?\n\nThe Guardians are set to open the 2025 season March 27 in Kansas City. Their home opener is scheduled for April 8 against the Chicago White Sox. This year, the Guardians won't have to work around a total solar eclipse."

The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms.

Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022.
