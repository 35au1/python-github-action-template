        "article_content": "An Air Force base in Indiana has become the latest hotspot for mysterious UFOs after residents spotted swarms of fast-moving, glowing orbs in the skies.\n\nDozens of people in Kokomo, which sits just 13 miles outside of Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base, reported seeing hovering flickering lights that vanished into thin air.\n\n'What is that,' shouted one local who filmed the lights. 'I think those are UFOs and I really don't feel comfortable going to sleep tonight.'\n\nThe uncanny sightings, most reported on October 7, echo recent UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia where officials reported seeing 'flashing red, green, and white lights 'moving at rapid speeds.'\n\nThe mysterious objects in Indiana, however, were shared online where experts have weighed in to determine the source.\n\nSome suggested the lights were flares dropped from planes, possibly military aircraft, but one witness who shared doppler weather radar evidence of a 'huge rectangle' UFO with a 'clearly defined vapor shock wave' on October 8.\n\nRed 'walking' swarms of UFOs - along with one fast, zig-zagging, gleaming white UFO - have terrified and confused residents of Kokomo, Indiana this October\n\nNo explanation has been publicly provided by US Air Force personnel for the UFOs, which appeared with the reddish-orange that hovered in the sky or the white orb that zig-zagged in a fast maneuver.\n\n'I don't understand what those are,' Christina Sharp said in a TikTok as young children nearby were heard marveling at the glowing reddish-orange lights.\n\nOne anonymous local submitted a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) on October 8 of what may have been a related event.\n\nThe person stated that a brief incursion on doppler weather radar showed what looked like a large rectangle UFO speeding nearby, estimated to be about half as big as Disney World.\n\n'I've seen many easily explained radar anomalies over the years,' the witness said, 'but never a huge rectangle with a clearly defined vapor shock wave and trail.'\n\n'Judging by the image size, rectangle would be approximately 20 miles in length,' the witness added.\n\n'Compressed vapor trail appears to be in excess of 150-miles long.'\n\nWhile it's unclear if this bizarre radar return relates to the previous night's wave of strange lights in the sky, several seasoned analysts of UFO videos told DailyMail.com that Kokomo's citizens most likely saw military flares.\n\nOne anonymous witness who submitted a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) witnessed a baffling and potentially related event: a brief incursion on doppler weather radar (above) of what looked like a large rectangle UFO speeding nearby, estimated to be about half as big as Disney World (20 miles long). The radar UFO was seen the morning after\n\n'These look very clearly to be military flares,' said Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to tech start-up Enigma Labs, where he helps investigate witness submissions to the group's growing database of UFO sightings.\n\n'The tell-tale signs,' Rojas explained, 'are the lights being in a row and lighting up and disappearing in succession.'\n\nIn addition to the Grissom base to the north, Rojas noted several other USAF bases surrounding Kokomo that may have been responsible for the late night lightshow.\n\n'Kokomo is around 50 miles away from Camp Fort Wayne [Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base],' he added.\n\n'Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton is also about 150 miles away. These could be from either location.'\n\nRojas, who served for many years as the official spokesperson for citizen-led Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), said that he has personally witnessed and videotaped just how eerie military flares can look under the cover of darkness.\n\nWhile it's unclear if the bizarre radar return relates to the previous night's wave of strange lights in the sky, one seasoned analyst of UFO videos told DailyMail.com that Kokomo's citizens most likely saw military flares: Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to tech start-up Enigma Labs\n\n'I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area and they often drop these flares while doing exercises at the Barry Goldwater Range,' he said. 'Sure enough they are also often mistaken for UFOs and sometimes the media will call me for a comment.'\n\nRojas, who has co-founded a new nonprofit to look into 'unidentified aerial phenomena' UAP Discovery, said the night sky can obscure more obvious signs of flares, like smoke or the aircraft that dropped the flares.\n\n'Witnesses have argued that smoke can be seen from flares, but that is typically not the case,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I made this video to show that smoke often can not be seen,' he said. 'My video is similar to most of the ones being alleged to be UFOs. I was about 150 miles from the flares when I took this video.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the public affairs specialist at the Grissom base and will update this article if they reply.\n\nThe strange cases in Indiana come just weeks after reports surfaced about the UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to takedown the infamous Chinese spy balloon back in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex- Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that the episode last December was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

On March 13th 1997, thousands of people saw a stream of mysterious lights bathe the night sky across Arizona and Nevada for three hours. Being the largest and most reported UFO in history, it was only a matter of time before the incident inspired a movie adaptation.\n\nPhoenix Forgotten opens with Sophie discovering footage of her brother, who went missing during the Phoenix Lights sighting 20 years ago. Sophie starts analysing the video, hoping to learn the truth about her brother's disappearance.\n\nRather than being a straightforward found-footage feature, Phoenix Forgotten keeps cutting between the unearthed tapes and Sophie's own investigation, which is a great way to amplify the tension. The initial tape ends as the brother discovers a charred corpse, so the audience is desperate for Sophie to uncover the rest of the footage to learn more.\n\nEven though the found-footage angle has been done to death, few films in the genre seem more authentic than Phoenix Forgotten. The scratched frames and analogue defects make the footage look like it originated from a VHS camcorder, making it easier to remain invested in the story."

        "article_content": "What Did the Pentagon Say About the Existence of UFOs & Aliens?\n\nThe Pentagon has addressed the topic of UFOs and aliens again, and it\u2019s the same line we\u2019ve heard for decades. The government has been treating the subject with increasing legitimacy over the last few years. Still, officials continue to be extremely skeptical of the existence of extraterrestrials. Unfortunately, even with the formation of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which coordinates efforts to investigate UFO sightings across government agencies, no definitive evidence of aliens has been released.\n\nPentagon maintains that there is no evidence of aliens visiting Earth\n\nAt a recent Pentagon press conference, press secretary Major General Pat Ryder addressed a question concerning the government\u2019s current stance on extraterrestrials.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Jeff Schogol of Task & Purpose asked, \u201cGiven the news cycle, you could announce anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life, and no one would care. So, I\u2019m just going to take the shot. What do you got on UFOs, aliens, etc.?\u201d\n\nIn response, Ryder stated, \u201cThe truth is out there, Jeff and the truth is, we have no evidence to indicate extraterrestrial life has visited the planet.\u201d\n\nDespite the formation of the AARO in 2022, all the evidence it\u2019s examined has been explained by natural phenomena or \u201cauthentic, sensitive national security programs,\u201d which were misinterpreted as being UFOs. However, its efforts to investigate claims are ongoing.\n\nRyder\u2019s recent response is the same one he gave in March 2024 when the last AARO report was released. In response to accusations that the military was hiding information from Congress about UFOs or extraterrestrials, he stated, \u201cWhat we found was that claims of hidden programs are largely the result of circular reporting by a small group repeating what they heard from others and that many people have sincerely misinterpreted real events for mistaking sensitive U.S. programs as UAP or being extra-terrestrial exploitation.\u201d\n\nSo, for now, the search continues.\n\nOriginally reported by Jason Faulkner on Mandatory.\n\nThe post What Did the Pentagon Say About the Existence of UFOs & Aliens? appeared first on ComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV & Streaming News, and More."

It also offers a library feature that tracks your previous searches for you to pull back up at a later date. You can also quickly access the app through various keyboard shortcuts.\n\nBut while the desktop app itself is free to download, you will need to subscribe to Perplexity\u2019s $20-per-month (or $200-per-year) Pro plan in order to actually use it. That $20 garners you additional benefits and capabilities including up to 600 \u201cPro Searches\u201d per day and your choice of AI model to use, as well as the ability to analyze uploaded files and images. The Perplexity web app is still free to use, mind you, and offers unlimited Quick Searches and as many as five Pro Searches per day, which offer more in-depth responses than a Quick Search would.\n\nThis announcement comes a week after the company rolled out two additional new features: Internal Knowledge Search and Spaces. Internal Knowledge Search enables the AI to search both the web and through the user\u2019s provided files to form more coherent and accurate answers. Spaces is a ChatGPT Canvas\u2013 or Claude Artifact-style collaboration area that previews responses to the user\u2019s queries outside of the chat itself.\n\nThe Perplexity Mac app is the fourth iteration of the company\u2019s AI, with the web app and Android and iOS apps all arriving last year.\n\nOn the other hand, Perplexity has been repeatedly accused of unethical behavior, unauthorized data scraping, and outright copyright infringement. The company is currently being sued by News Corp over allegations that it scraped data from the Wall Street Journal and New York Post in violation of copyright law."

        "article_content": "Apple Intelligence is the product of more than a year's worth of tireless testing. Here's what Apple engineers used to ensure the quality of their AI software.\n\nFor Apple, 2024 was undoubtedly the year of artificial intelligence. The company has long been working on machine learning features, with its most recent operating systems ushering in an entirely new set of AI-powered enhancements. They are known collectively under the moniker of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile the generative AI tools themselves were announced in June, at WWDC 2024, only a handful of them made their public debut with the first developer betas of iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1. Since then, Apple has rolled out more and more of the AI-powered enhancements with subsequent beta releases.\n\nAt the time of writing, the iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 updates are nearing the end of beta testing, while the first developer beta of iOS 18.2 has only just arrived. Months after the big announcement, some Apple Intelligence features are still only available on beta versions of Apple's operating systems.\n\nAccording to people who spoke with AppleInsider and accurately revealed many Apple Intelligence features months ahead of launch, the company spent a year working on its in-house generative AI tools before they were finally released to the general public.\n\nDuring development, Apple tried to keep the full scale of its AI endeavors a secret. Individual AI projects received their own codenames, as was the case with the email categorization feature, known as Project BlackPearl.\n\nApple Intelligence as a whole, however, was known by the codename Greymatter \u2014 an unmistakable reference to a type of tissue found in the human brain. Some of Apple's internal test applications also had names that concealed their overall purpose.\n\nDuring the development of Apple Intelligence, Apple used at least two dedicated test applications and environments to test its AI software.\n\nApple used multiple test applications during the development of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nThe two apps in question are known as 1UP, a reference to the ever-popular Super Mario series by Nintendo, and Smart Replies Tester. The name of the latter is self-explanatory, given that AI-powered Smart Replies have since made their way into release versions of Apple's operating systems, in the Mail and Messages applications.\n\nWe were told that internal distributions of iOS 18.0 and macOS 15.0 Sequoia featured many of the underlying Apple Intelligence frameworks used in the publicly available betas of iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1.\n\nThe frameworks were necessary for testing and were included alongside the standard development and configuration utilities found in Apple's internal-use operating systems.\n\nDifferent AI-related features could be toggled through feature flags, with the use of the Livability application. 1UP and Smart Replies Tester, the two known AI applications, were used by Apple's engineers to test the different aspects and use cases of Apple Intelligence.\n\n1UP \u2014 Text-generation testing with AI models\n\nFound even in the earliest internal-use builds of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, the 1UP application was used for testing text-related generative AI features. The application itself featured a variety of different test options and parameters, which could be adjusted as needed.\n\nThe 1UP app featured tests related to text-generation, and references to the Ajax large language model.\n\nPeople familiar with the application have told AppleInsider that it contains direct references to Apple's long-rumored in-house LLM or large language model, known as Ajax, which can function on-device.\n\nThe 1UP app features multiple test options, organized into different sections. One of the tests involves text generation. This part of the app was used to test \"autoregressive text generation from a prompt,\" people familiar with the app told us.\n\nIt allowed its users to choose between different AI models, including the aforementioned on-device Ajax LLM. The application also featured a setting to adjust the maximum number of generated tokens, which could be set anywhere from 30 to 100, the default being 48.\n\n1UP \u2014 Document analysis, topic analysis, and text understanding\n\nBased on what we were told, it's apparent that Apple placed significant focus on AI's document and file understanding. Some tests found within the 1UP app were focused on document and text analysis. Whether the user input consisted of raw text, a PDF, or a Word document, Apple's software was supposed to identify key information within the text, such as phone numbers, addresses, languages, and text author, if applicable.\n\nA mockup of the 1UP user interface, based on the information provided to us by people familiar with the app.\n\nWeb history from Safari and conversations from Messages could also be analyzed for keywords, or \"topics,\" as they were known within the app. This could include words that repeat often or those that appear to be the focal point of a text. Apple-specific terms are also recognized, and key sentences are isolated.\n\nThe app was also capable of cross-referencing the information found in a text or document with the user's information. For instance, whether or not a phone number was saved in the user's Contacts, or if an event was found in the Calendar.\n\nThe significance of the 1UP tests, and the clues about Apple Intelligence\n\nThe 1UP tests offered hints as to what would eventually become Apple Intelligence features, such as the upgraded Siri with personal context, and Writing Tools. With Apple Intelligence, it's possible to edit texts and generate text-based summaries of the user's conversations, where key details such as names, dates, and locations are highlighted.\n\nApple's own AI prompts also revealed that the company explored multiple levels of summarization, including summaries consisting of only 10 or 20 words. AppleInsider paraphrased many of these prompts before they were ever made public.\n\nThe tests within the 1UP are indicative of what Apple wanted to do with Safari as well, which was to have its AI use the information from web pages the user visits. This idea eventually led to the Intelligent Search feature, now known as Highlights.\n\nText generation and document analysis are now handled by ChatGPT rather than Apple's AI\n\nWith the first developer beta of iOS 18.2, Apple notably improved Siri through integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Requests and queries that Siri is unable to process are handed over to ChatGPT, albeit only with direct user approval.\n\nTests in the 1UP app seem to mirror the functionality made possible by ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2.\n\niOS 18.2 also introduces a new splash screen outlining some of the key features made possible via ChatGPT integration, such as text generation in Writing Tools and document analysis.\n\nThe 1UP app features tests for virtually the same things, indicating that Apple had perhaps wanted to accomplish ChatGPT-like features independently, through its own AI models.\n\nAlong with the 1UP app, Apple used another internal application known as Smart Replies Tester.\n\nSmart Replies Tester \u2014 evaluating AI-generated responses\n\nWith iOS 18.1, Apple introduced AI-assisted Smart Replies, which are available in Mail and Messages. This feature makes it significantly easier to draft a response to an email or message within Apple's built-in apps.\n\nInternally, Apple used a dedicated app to test Smart Replies. It instantly generated multiple replies based on the input text.\n\nOn an iPhone, Smart Replies appear as response suggestions above the keyboard in Mail. Apple Intelligence can generate responses to direct questions the user may be replying to, but it is often less useful in other situations.\n\nSmart Replies Tester was seemingly built to test just that, how well Apple's AI can generate a response, and how quickly. The app measured the response generation time in milliseconds.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the internal application consists of multiple test menus where users can input text, and instantly receive several AI-generated Smart Replies. This occurs entirely on-device, and the responses change as soon as the input text is altered in any way.\n\nSmart Replies can be found in the Mail app on iOS 18.2.\n\nThe app also can be used with an image captioning model, which is downloaded separately. Mass image captioning was possible as well. As for similar features in the iOS 18.1 beta, the Photos application now contains a greatly improved search functionality, which lets people locate images containing specific objects or locations with relative ease.\n\nWhile Smart Replies Tester is distinctly AI-related, other internal applications also offer insight into Apple's approach and way of thinking in regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nMegadome \u2014 Your personal context, all in one app\n\nAnother of Apple's internal apps, Megadome serves as the perfect visual aid for Siri's upcoming personal context feature, powered by Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Megadome app aggregates user data and organizes it into different categories.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the Megadome application can gather relevant user information, sort it into categories, and present it in the form of neatly organized cards.\n\nThe app can display the most important details about its user, including their full name, significant locations, relationships, groups, contact information, organizations, installed software, and much more. Megadome seemingly gathers this information from system applications the user has interacted with.\n\nThis information can also be viewed in the form of a so-called \"Reality Graph,\" which visualizes the relationship between entities and locations in the form of a diagram.\n\nWhy Apple made Megadome, and the features it mirrors\n\nWhile the idea of an app that knows everything about you might seem nightmarish at first glance, the app is merely an internal-use tool, not something made for the general public. Its existence ultimately makes sense when things are taken into context.\n\nApple's Megadome app offers some insights about the company's thought process.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri will gain the ability to process natural language. The virtual assistant will also have a firm grasp of the user's so-called personal context, as a result of the AI upgrade.\n\nThis means that Siri will be able to understand facts about the user's life \u2014 the different people and places important to them. In many ways, the Megadome app is an embodiment of this idea. Apple wanted to build a tool that could understand the important aspects of someone's life, and use these details to help the user.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of Apple Intelligence?\n\nApple's internal applications often serve as an accurate indicator of things to come in the near future. Although they may feature various puns, memes, and obscure inside jokes, the company's test apps reveal quite a lot about in-development features.\n\nApple's test applications often contain tidbits about upcoming features, such as the ones powered by Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile names such as 1UP, GreyParrot, and Megadome don't mean anything to the average user, almost everyone has used the Calculator or tested Apple Intelligence in one form or another.\n\nThis phenomenon is hardly anything new. Even back in 2020, the internal-use app known as Gobi painted a pretty good picture of what would eventually become App Clips. Should any information about future test apps come to light, we will most likely be able to infer something about an upcoming feature."

She runs her own consulting business, teaches at Brandeis University, and launched two apps to help small businesses and content creators.\n\n\u201cA lot of the clients that we have are very small and they definitely don\u2019t have the staff or the resources to have a full communications team,\u201d said Adriana Lacy, Cofounder and CEO of Adriana Lacy Consulting.\n\nWith a small team around herself, Lacy and her employees jumped into the AI world to help add more of what we all want---time and money. Her team created two apps---one, called Social Chime, helps with social media management.\n\n\u201cSo with this app, not only can they manage their social media profiles, but they can also use AI to help them with caption writing AI to help them with generating images, to really just help them increase their workflow.\u201d\n\nWith 4.9 billion people on social media, according to Forbes, businesses are searching for ways to make themselves stand out. Lacy explained how her app worked, including using the AI assistant button to write out a post and within seconds, a caption spits out. She said this helps drive traffic to a site, using minimal time and money. Her other app compiles data from multiple sources and issues daily reports.\n\n\u201cWhat I see with a lot of smaller business owners is they may never, you know, check their sales or their advertising on a daily basis, and they might just be losing out on money or on customers because they\u2019re not staying ahead of this and being able to deliver them,\u201d said Lacy.\n\nLacy says AI can help businesses make more informed decisions, but she\u2019s also focused on the ethical use of AI and double-checking what it spits out.\n\n\u201cEven though it is, you know, machine-controlled machine outputs, these outputs were created by humans,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cSo of course there\u2019s always biases that are baked into these models that can disadvantage people.\u201d\n\nAs a Forbes 30 under 30 honoree, she hopes her influence can break some barriers in the field of AI.\n\n\u201cYou look at some of the biggest AI companies right now, they\u2019re all run by men,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a really great time to have more women in the field really thinking and just providing more diverse perspectives.\u201d\n\nLacy created the apps to serve as a lifeline for small businesses that can\u2019t afford social media management tools that cost hundreds of dollars. Her Social Chime and Insight Analytics apps start at $33 a month.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW"

Did you hear that?\u201d McLean reacts.\n\nIt\u2019s someone working upstairs, mostly likely.\n\nBut maybe not.\n\nPresentation House Theatre is one of the oldest buildings on the North Shore and, according to the Vancouver Paranormal Society, likely one of the most haunted.\n\nResearchers from the society are preparing to share the findings of their investigation into spirits who still dwell in the theatre at a one-night show scheduled for Oct. 29.\n\nGhosts in the machines\n\nLeah McLean and Mike O\u2019Dell of the Vancouver Paranormal Society scan for paranormal activity at North Vancouver\u2019s Presentation House Theatre. The group will present their findings at a one-night show on Oct. 29. | Paul McGrath / North Shore News\n\nSearching for proof of an afterlife here on earth doesn\u2019t involve a s\u00e9ance or a Ouija board. Instead, paranormal researchers prefer more sophisticated tools \u2013 night vision cameras and infrared spectrum lighting, proximity sensors that emit light if something interrupts the electromagnetic field around them, devices that scan radio frequencies for unexplainable interruptions.\n\nThe most important piece of equipment though is a simple digital voice recorder that the investigators say is capable of capturing voices that our naked ears can\u2019t hear. More than passively listening or scanning for activity on their instruments, investigators like McLean speak out to the seemingly empty room and find answers only when they\u2019re analyzing their recordings at home.\n\nAll of it is based on the theory that, even after a person has died, there remains a spirit that is tangible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all made up of energy, right? And that energy of ours is housed in our body, but when we no longer have a body, we\u2019re in a spirit form. We\u2019re just energy,\u201d Kelly Berge, president of the Vancouver Paranormal Society, explains.\n\nRather than attributing every flicker of light or bit of static on the radio to a presence from beyond the dead, they first look for corroborating evidence from their other instruments.\n\nOther times \u2013 rarely \u2013 our own senses are enough to do the job.\n\nBerge said she\u2019s always felt since she was just a kiddo that there was something more beyond the corporeal. As she was peering into her closet one night when she was about 10, she got all the proof she\u2019d need for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cI saw a floating opalescent skull. You know when you do that thing where you rub your eyes and you look again, and it was still there,\u201d she said. \u201cI never slept in that room again, but that experience stuck with me.\u2026 I always knew I wanted to figure this out.\u201d\n\nTypically, at least three or four of the non-profit\u2019s team of 11 volunteers are out every weekend carrying out investigations on behalf of clients who\u2019ve requested them. Importantly, the team never charges a fee of any kind, Berge notes.\n\nMost of their work comes from residential homeowners who want to know what\u2019s making things go bump in the night, but it\u2019s the public buildings with long histories that offer the most promise.\n\nThanks to rumours already swirling about it in the community, Presentation House Theatre had long been near the top of the list of places that the team was itching to get into, Berge said.\n\nPresentation House Theatre\u2019s haunting inhabitants\n\nPresentation House Theatre in North Vancouver. | Alanna Kelly / North Shore News\n\nThe building itself dates back to 1902 when it was built as a school. It later became the City of North Vancouver\u2019s municipal hall, a police station and jail, and offices for the city\u2019s engineering department before finally becoming a museum and arts facility in the 1970s.\n\nAraceli Ferrara, marketing co-ordinator for Presentation House Theatre, said she began hearing about the building\u2019s ghosts on her first day of work, and she\u2019s tagged along with the investigators on all of their visits.\n\nActors have reported feeling a strange presence while backstage. One of the technicians has heard the sound of footsteps sprinting toward him while working alone late at night. Once, after one of his gloves went missing on the job, it turned up the next day folded neatly in the middle of the set. And everyone gets \u201cbad vibes\u201d from the third floor, Ferrara said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen a few things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been here past midnight. I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have made five official visits to the theatre since 2023, with more planned in the future.\n\n\u201cEvery time we come, we get more and more confirmation that there\u2019s something here. So, we just keep coming back,\u201d said McLean, one of the Paranormal Society\u2019s volunteers.\n\nUntil the recent investigations, the most authoritative source on paranormal activity at Presentation House Theatre was the word of Cecil Halsey, the building\u2019s caretaker for more than 25 years. Halsey, who sometimes slept in the 122-year-old building, was well acquainted with Frank, one of the most frequently encountered spirits there.\n\nBerge said they found plenty of evidence that Frank is still there and that he is \u201ckind of inappropriate.\u201d\n\nHe likes whisky, they learned, and among the phrases they captured him saying were \u201cbad and beautiful\u201d and \u201cshut up, bitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are usually the same personality in death and spirit as they were in life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just being a jerk. He\u2019s being who he was in real life, but he\u2019s not going to harm me. He\u2019s not going to harm the staff.\u2026 It\u2019s not like those TV shows where everything is demonic and all that. That\u2019s extremely, extremely rare.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean though that wayward spirits can\u2019t still send a chill down the spine of even a seasoned paranormal researcher. On their last visit to Presentation House, the batteries in the team\u2019s cameras all died simultaneously and unexpectedly. Moments later, Berge saw an apparition in the very seats where Presentation House\u2019s guests pay to sit.\n\n\u201cI saw a black shadow figure, very stark, crouch down and lean into the aisle chair, and then it was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was something that shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also another spirit of a younger girl on the third floor, according to the team. And it appears as though there's someone new to keep Frank company: the old caretaker Halsey died in 2019, but he identified himself, albeit faintly, to the investigators at the theatre, Berge said.\n\nI ain\u2019t afraid of no ghosts\n\nLeah McLean and Mike O'Dell, investigators with the Vancouver Paranormal Society, listen for activity in North Vancouver's Presentation House Theatre. | Alanna Kelly / North Shore News\n\nWhether it\u2019s in a home or place of business, more than anything after an investigation, clients get some peace of mind, Berge said.\n\n\u201cPeace of mind, and (knowing) they\u2019re not crazy. They weren\u2019t making this up in their heads. They did experience these things, as did we, and that is a huge thing,\u201d she said.\n\nKnowing you have a spirit present is one thing. But ghosts, she added, are not in need of \"busting.\" Instead, some frank communication (no pun intended) is probably what\u2019s most needed \u2013 letting the spirit know that the living inhabitants of today have a right to be there and that everyone can coexist harmoniously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the client a tool to be strong and to take their power back in their home. And quite often, when that happens and they\u2019re feeling more settled, the activity tends to settle down a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the things I always say is ghosts are people too. They\u2019re just further along in the journey than we are, but we\u2019re going to be there someday, right? So we have to come with the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nDo you believe?\n\nRunning into skeptics comes with the territory, and Berge acknowledges none of the evidence they\u2019ve collected will be enough to meet some people\u2019s standards. But, she added, those who are committed to their closed-mindedness are robbing themselves of the possibility that there may be something else \u201cout there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t certify it as haunted, because we\u2019re dealing with a science that isn\u2019t recognized by mainstream science, right? So the jury\u2019s still out, because there is no definable proof,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced it over hundreds of investigations, but they still just make up their mind so they\u2019re not open. And that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAnd more people are closer to believing in the paranormal than might be prepared to admit, suggests Mike O\u2019Dell, another of the Vancouver Paranormal Society's volunteer investigators.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s skeptics out there \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 and people who don\u2019t believe in this, and that\u2019s fine.\u2026 But for me, it\u2019s when I can\u2019t apply logic or science to something that makes me go \u2018hmm,\u2019 and if I can\u2019t explain something, then that\u2019s the definition of paranormal,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say 99 per cent of the time, it\u2019s just an entity or an energy that wants to be acknowledged, wants to communicate, wants to say \u2018Hi,\u2019 and just wants to live in peace.\u201d\n\nThis is a busy time of year for the Vancouver Paranormal Society. Around Halloween, people are more willing to explore the big questions that ghost stories pose about the nature of mortality. Or they just want to have some good, clean seasonal fun and have the wits scared out of them in the process.\n\n\u201cPeople, especially around Halloween, are very interested in the paranormal. They want to know if it\u2019s true or not. They want to have that little bit of a thrill and some people may have had their own experiences,\u201d Berge said.\n\nBecause of that innate desire to know the unknowable, Ferrara said she expects the Haunted Histories show to be a hit for the true believers, the skeptics and those caught between worlds.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest in death. I know it\u2019s macabre, but, because there\u2019s a stigma around it, we don\u2019t talk about it as openly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to delve into something that you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHaunted Histories: An Evening with the Vancouver Paranormal Society runs Tuesday, Oct. 29, 7:30 p.m. at Presentation House Theatre. Tickets are available at phtheatre.org/box-office/.\n\n[email protected]\n\ntwitter.com/brentrichter\n\n- video by Alanna Kelly, Glacier Media"

        "article_content": "A major discovery in Iraq\u2019s historic Babylon Governorate is a significant breakthrough in better understanding the evolution of the ancient city.\n\nThere are parts of the excavation site that date back to the Sasanian Empire of the 3 rd through 7 th centuries, but a majority of the best-preserved parts of the site are remnants of the Old Babylonian era of over 3,000 years ago.\n\nthrough 7 centuries, but a majority of the best-preserved parts of the site are remnants of the Old Babylonian era of over 3,000 years ago. In addition to physical structures remaining from the ancient civilization, there were plenty of individual artifacts discovered, including ancient seals and cuneiform tablets.\n\nFor most archaeologists, discovering a single ancient artifact is probably a thrilling experience. Finding three? A monumental moment. 10? A dream come true.\n\nWhat about nearly 500?\n\nIs there a feeling that can even capture the magnitude? To find out, you\u2019d have to ask Quhtan Abbas Hassan Aboud, the lead on an archaeological excavation in Iraq\u2019s Babylon Governorate. In mid-October, the team\u2014working on a dig in the Al-Fayadiya district\u2014discovered a major section of ancient Babylon that spans two periods of the city\u2019s development. The find contained 478 artifacts from both periods, including ancient seals, cuneiform tablets, and more, according to Archaeology Magazine.\n\nThe team separated the discovery into two sections (A and B), according to a statement from the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. Section A covered about 6,000 square meters of the excavation site, and within it, archaeologists found remains that represented two distinct time periods. The top layer dates back to the Sasanian period, which stretched from 224 to 651 A.D. during the reign of the Sasanian Empire\u2014one of the last pre-Islamic empires of Iran.\n\nUnfortunately, because they\u2019ve spent a millennium and a half much closer to the surface of the soil, the ruins of the empire suffered plenty of erosion and deterioration. So, while the discovery is key in tracing the history of ancient Babylon, it pales in comparison to what the archaeologists found underneath it.\n\nThe second layer of Section A was much more well-preserved and much, much older\u2014experts traced it back to the Old Babylonian era, which stretched from 1894 to 1595 B.C.\n\nHowever, the excitement around Section B far outshone that for either layer of the first section. Section B was notably larger than Section A, at about 9,000 square meters, and contained a massive bounty of Babylonian antiquities. The whole section dates back to the same era as the lower layer of Section A, and\u2014in addition to the individual artifacts like pottery and cylindrical seals\u2014Aboud\u2019s crew was able to map out what they believed to be residential homes.\n\nRelated Story Archaeologists Find New Ancient Board Game Tablets\n\nTwo housing units that the archaeologists uncovered contained multiple, various-sized rooms that could have served as living spaces, work areas, or storage, providing significant insight into the living habits and conditions of Old Babylon\u2019s common residents.\n\nThe smaller, individual pieces of history\u2014the pottery, writing tablets, seals, and more\u2014that were part of the discovery are just as important as the structures unearthed in the area. The cylindrical seals, for instance, were in pristine condition despite being over 3,000 years old. Once used to sign documents and denote ownership, seals were an important person item and were often ornately decorated. While they served a functional purpose, they also now serve as crucial pieces of the history of aesthetics and symbolism\u2014not just in Babylon, but across ancient Mesopotamia and the rest of the world.\n\nJust as important a find are the various cuneiform tablets. The logo-syllabic writing style is one of the earliest in civilized history, and translations of the ancient Babylonian tablets are essentially windows into the civilization\u2019s commerce, government, and other facets of life. They provide a direct path to better understanding the ancient city.\n\nBut then again, so does the entire discovery. How lucky."

        "article_content": "A New Deep Sea Remotely Operated Vehicle Coming to USM\n\nThu, 10/24/2024 - 10:54am | By: Gabriela Shinskie\n\nThe University of Southern Mississippi (USM), a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute (OECI), will soon be operating a new medium-size remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the Gulf of Mexico. To meet the growing demand to conduct fundamental research, discovery, and inform restoration efforts on the deep seafloor and water column, NOAA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently announced they will fund the design and build of two ROVs. These vehicles will begin construction in 2024 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. One of these vehicles will be operated by USM, and WHOI\u2019s National Deep Submergence Facility will operate the other.\n\nThese vehicles aim to work on a wider range of oceanographic ships than is currently possible. Many ROVs are designed to only operate on one or two ships, which can limit research scope, and access to deep sea technologies. Dr. Leila Hamdan, USM Associate Vice President for Research, notes, \u201cAnything that creates a barrier to technology access can potentially be a barrier to discovery. The decision to fund and build these ROVs shows a commitment by NSF and NOAA to lift barriers and create increased access for the ocean science workforce of the future.\u201d\n\nAlong with increasing the ability for scientists across the nation to conduct advanced, ROV-supported exploration, these vehicles will generate new growth for the ocean-based blue economy workforce. \u201cTo operate these vehicles successfully, we will need skilled staff to maintain and operate them. What better place to seek such skills than from our students in the Ocean Engineering program at USM\u201d.\n\nDr. Robert Leaf is Director of USM\u2019s School of Ocean Science and Engineering, which offers the Ocean Engineering Bachelor of Science program and a joint Ocean Enterprise Engineering Pathway program, allowing students pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Ocean Engineering opportunity to stay a fifth year to earn a Master\u2019s in Business Administration.\n\nLeaf notes \u201cThis is an incredible time to be a student at Southern Miss. An investment like this will unlock doors for them to have rewarding careers in research, discovery and blue technology for decades to come.\u201d\n\nThe NOAA-funded ROV is planned to operate in the Gulf to support the Mesophotic and Deep Benthic Communities restoration project, a multi-year study that aims to restore vital seafloor habitats damaged by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The project is multidisciplinary and includes a large network of academic, not-for-profit, and government organizations working together to restore deep-sea habitats, a very challenging task.\n\n\u201cThis ROV is going to be instrumental to the restoration effort and will open doors to discovery for scientists across the Gulf region and beyond\u201d, said Hamdan. The vehicle will operate from USM\u2019s Roger F. Wicker Center for Ocean Enterprise.\n\nClick here to learn more about the mROVs."

        "article_content": "Pamela and Peter Deibele sit at a wrought-iron table in the cozy al fresco area of Emily\u2019s Garden restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, vibing on the chill sounds coming from a DJ, the small bites and wines being passed around by servers, and the afterglow from a rainstorm two hours before.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s charming,\u201d Pamela says. \u201cIt reminds me of an Italian garden. It\u2019s like a little courtyard that\u2019s hidden. And the bocce ball, of course. Who doesn\u2019t want to play bocce ball?\u201d\n\nThe Fort Lauderdale couple are at a family-and-friends party for Emily\u2019s Garden, an eatery that blossomed in the former space of O-B House in Himmarshee Village downtown, next to the Museum of Discovery and Science.\n\nAround the perimeter of the outdoor space is a burger station with grills and a trailer offering gourmet coffee, all a part of vendor collaborations at the venue with more to come.\n\nOwned by the Mele brothers \u2014 the family behind the boutique chain of Pummarola Pizzeria Napoletana restaurants \u2014 Emily\u2019s Garden has a unique concept.\n\n\u201cWhat we plan to do here is put together some great artists in the food industry,\u201d explains Larry Mele. \u201cSo we got the best coffee, which is On The Run Coffee Bar and pizza, the best pizza from Pummarola. We have a guy from Miami called Burgermeister, who does an incredible burger.\n\n\u201cAnd we have, in the kitchen from Boca Raton, Patio Tapas & Beer, and breakfast and lunch with chef Diego [Pasqualicchio, of River Caf\u00e9], who is an Italian chef \u2026 Fernando Mato is the executive chef supervising all vendors.\u201d\n\nThe idea is for diners to enjoy varied fare.\n\n\u201cSome people can eat a burger, we have pizza, we have coffee, tapas and wine \u2026 300 different wines,\u201d Davis Mele adds. \u201cIn a couple of months, we\u2019re ready to sell drinks, a full bar. For me, it\u2019s like Disney World.\u201d\n\nAnother brother, Loris Mele, is a certified pizzaiolo and the pizza master for both Emily\u2019s Garden and the Fort Lauderdale location of Pummarola, which is right around the corner. He predicts people will visit their newest venture for more than the menus: \u201cPeople will come not only for the food and drink, but also to be in a place together \u2026 enjoying all of the different cultures.\u201d\n\nThe Neapolitan band of brothers opened Emily\u2019s Garden in September, but have been working since April on the new concept \u2014 morphing the 120-seat outdoor area from gravel to a combination of stone-paved and artificial turf. Inside, which has seating for 30 guests, the walls are festooned with the works of local artists and thrift-store-chic photos.\n\nThat small indoor dining area, designed to evoke a lounge or living room, is equally important, according to general manager Clint LeFevre.\n\n\u201cYou might be here with four people, but those four people are free to mix and mingle with the other people that we have out here,\u201d he says from beside the small bocce ball court, before gesturing toward the building. \u201cThen we have inside, where it\u2019s a little bit more of, I guess, an introverted way of socializing. It\u2019s more like the four people that you have at your table.\n\nBertha Hurtado, owner of On The Run Coffee Bar, speaks with a customer.

(Scott Luxor/Contributor) Expand\n\n\u201cThe music that we have outside also plays through our speakers on the inside, so it\u2019ll be set at more of an ambient level, as opposed to entertainment level,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo if you want to come in and sit down and have a bottle of wine and read a book, you could do that in there with the music in the background. It\u2019s still a really comfortable place. However you choose to socialize, we want to be your place to do that.\u201d\n\nBertha Hurtado, who owns On The Run Coffee Bar, recalls the first time Larry Mele showed her the space: \u201cAs soon as I walked in, his energy was just so genuine. He introduced me to Emily\u2019s Garden, and I honestly, genuinely fell in love with the concept. It\u2019s beautiful. I saw tremendous potential right away, there was no question, there was no doubt in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe concept will work, the Meles insist, because their business model allows them to manage Emily\u2019s Garden as well as their Pummarola restaurants throughout the tricounty area. There are also two locations in Spain, in Ibiza and Barcelona. The seven Mele brothers run the brand.\n\n\u201cWe are a big family,\u201d Davis Mele says. \u201cWe\u2019re busy, but I think Pummarola has a secret \u2026 We allow up to 60% of any concept that we build to be owned by the employees. So just like Pummarola here [in Fort Lauderdale], I think employees own 70%. So we kept 30% and therefore it\u2019s not a problem finding employees because they are partners.\u201d\n\nThe Meles may be a big family, but it has no one named Emily. So what\u2019s with the restaurant\u2019s moniker?\n\nWell, it comes from a dog. To be exact, the dog of former property owner Amanda Mercede.\n\nLarry Mele explains: \u201cThere was a big developer who wanted the property, but she was very attached to it. It was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m not gonna sell it to them. I\u2019ll sell it to you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe only thing she insisted on was that they keep the garden space. The Meles went one step further.\n\n\u201cThe owner of this property had a dog, Emily, very sweet. It\u2019s a dalmatian,\u201d Larry Mele says. \u201cSo I say, look, I\u2019ll call it Emily\u2019s Garden.\u201d\n\nEmily\u2019s Garden is located at 327 SW Second St., Fort Lauderdale.

        "article_content": "Chicago is well-known for its tall buildings, deep-dish pizza, and rich history, but there\u2019s something else getting a lot of attention its exciting startup scene. Over the last few years, Chicago has become a hot spot for people with fresh ideas, bringing in entrepreneurs from around the world who want to kickstart their businesses.\n\nBut what makes Chicago\u2019s startup scene different from places like Silicon Valley or New York? Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes this city stand out.\n\nLots of Support for Entrepreneurs\n\nOne of the best things about starting a business in Chicago is the amount of support entrepreneurs get. In some cities, new businesses are on their own, but not here. There are tons of resources, like incubators, accelerators, and shared workspaces, designed to help startups grow.\n\nPlaces like 1871 provide mentorship, office space, and chances to connect with others, which helps people build their businesses. Chicago\u2019s universities, like The University of Chicago and Northwestern University, also offer programs to teach young people how to become entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd when it comes to funding, Chicago has a lot of investors and venture capital firms that want to support new businesses, so entrepreneurs don\u2019t have to go far to find financial backing.\n\nA Diverse and Inclusive Startup Community\n\nChicago\u2019s startup scene stands out because it\u2019s open to everyone. Unlike other cities where certain groups might dominate, Chicago welcomes people from all backgrounds. This focus on diversity brings different perspectives and new ideas to the table.\n\nOrganizations like Chicago Blend help promote diversity in the tech and startup industries, offering resources to support underrepresented groups. This inclusive atmosphere makes the startup culture more creative and innovative.\n\nA Strong Community\n\nIn some cities, startups see each other as competition. But in Chicago, there\u2019s a strong sense of community. Entrepreneurs often work together, share ideas, and help each other succeed.\n\nEvents like Chicago Startup Week and Techstars Startup Weekend bring people together to learn, network, and collaborate. It\u2019s common to see more experienced entrepreneurs mentoring newer ones, sharing advice and offering support.\n\nThere\u2019s also a tradition of giving back in Chicago. Entrepreneurs who have been successful often invest in local businesses, mentor new founders, and create programs to encourage more people to start their own ventures.\n\n4. Solving Real-World Problems\n\nChicago\u2019s startups focus on solving real issues that affect people\u2019s daily lives. Instead of chasing the next big trend, many entrepreneurs in the city work on businesses that improve things like transportation, education, and healthcare.\n\nFor example, SpotHero, a parking app, and VillageMD, a healthcare company, are just two examples of businesses that aim to make life easier for people in the city and beyond. This approach gives Chicago a reputation for being a place where people tackle real challenges.\n\nAffordability and Access\n\nStarting a business in cities like New York or San Francisco can be super expensive. But in Chicago, things like rent, office space, and employee salaries are much more affordable. This gives startups more breathing room financially, allowing them to focus on growing their businesses without breaking the bank.\n\nChicago\u2019s location also makes it easy to connect with clients, investors, and partners across the country and around the world. Thanks to its transportation system and O\u2019Hare International Airport, Chicago is well-connected to major cities globally.\n\nHard Work Pays Off\n\nChicagoans are known for their strong work ethic, and this mindset is a big part of the city\u2019s startup culture. Entrepreneurs here aren\u2019t just in it for quick success they\u2019re willing to put in the hard work, face challenges, and keep going even when things get tough.\n\nThis determination and grit help Chicago startups stand out. They\u2019re not only innovative but also resilient, able to handle ups and downs and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nConclusion: A City of Opportunity\n\nChicago\u2019s startup scene is unique because it\u2019s supportive, diverse, community-focused, and centered on solving real problems. It\u2019s also more affordable than other big cities, making it a great place to start a business.\n\nWhether you\u2019re just starting out or looking to grow your business, Chicago offers everything you need to succeed. It\u2019s a city full of opportunity, where entrepreneurs can thrive and turn their ideas into reality. So, if you\u2019re ready to launch your next big idea, Chicago might just be the perfect place to do it."

        "article_content": "Atlanta, Georgia, is known for its history, southern hospitality, and a booming music scene, but lately, it\u2019s making waves as a top spot for startups. More and more young people are choosing Atlanta to launch their business dreams. So, what\u2019s so special about Atlanta\u2019s startup scene? Let\u2019s break down why this city is attracting entrepreneurs and why it\u2019s a great place to start a business.\n\nA Diverse and Welcoming Environment\n\nOne of the things that make Atlanta stand out is its diversity. People from all different backgrounds and cultures live and work here, and that includes the startup community. Places like Atlanta Tech Village and the Russell Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (RCIE) provide resources, mentoring, and networking to help everyone succeed, no matter where they\u2019re from.\n\nAffordable Cost of Living\n\nCompared to big cities like New York or San Francisco, Atlanta is way more affordable. Rent, food, and other living expenses are lower here, making it easier for young entrepreneurs to focus on building their business instead of worrying about paying the bills. This lower cost of living allows startups to put more money into growing their company instead of just making ends meet.\n\nSupport from Local Universities\n\nAtlanta is home to top-notch universities like Georgia Tech, Emory University, and Morehouse College. These schools are huge supporters of the local startup community. Georgia Tech, for example, offers programs that help young entrepreneurs develop and grow their ideas. For anyone working in tech, business, or science, being close to these universities is a big advantage. They provide access to resources, mentors, and innovative research that can help a startup thrive.\n\nA Thriving Tech Scene\n\nAtlanta is also becoming a tech hotspot. Big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and NCR have a presence in the city, bringing in tech talent and creating a strong ecosystem for startups. Programs like Techstars Atlanta and the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) give startups the funding, mentorship, and office space they need to succeed. For tech entrepreneurs, Atlanta is full of opportunities to make their mark.\n\nPlenty of Investors\n\nEvery startup needs funding to grow, and Atlanta is attracting more and more investors. Venture capital firms and angel investors are increasingly looking at Atlanta as a great place to find new businesses to invest in. While it may not have as much funding as Silicon Valley, Atlanta\u2019s investors are known for being more approachable, especially for new startups. Firms like BIP Capital and Panoramic Ventures are on the lookout for promising entrepreneurs with great ideas.\n\nA Collaborative Community\n\nIn some cities, the startup world can be super competitive, but in Atlanta, there\u2019s a strong sense of collaboration. Entrepreneurs help each other out, sharing ideas, resources, and connections. Organizations like Startup Atlanta and Hypepotamus host events where people can meet, learn, and support each other. This teamwork creates a friendly and encouraging environment for young startups.\n\nFocus on Making a Difference\n\nA lot of startups in Atlanta aren\u2019t just about making money they want to make a positive impact on the world. Businesses like Goodr and Rubicon Global are tackling social and environmental challenges, like reducing food waste or improving recycling. This focus on social entrepreneurship has drawn in a new generation of entrepreneurs who want to change the world while building a successful business.\n\nGreat Quality of Life\n\nBeyond the business opportunities, Atlanta is simply a great place to live. The city has beautiful parks like Piedmont Park and the Atlanta BeltLine, where people can relax and enjoy the outdoors.

        "article_content": "Avast One Gold for Mac MSRP $179.99 Score Details \u201cAvast One for Mac offers powerful, free antivirus software with virus scans and browser blocking.\u201d Pros Excellent malware protection record\n\nUser-friendly app\n\nCustomizable plans\n\n24/7 live support\n\nFree app includes a VPN Cons Big price increases on renewal\n\nFree VPN has a 5GB/month cap\n\nAvast is an antivirus software developer that supports macOS, and the Avast One package includes extra cybersecurity features that go beyond simple malware scans. Antivirus, ransomware protection, malware blocking, and more are available in free and paid subscription plans.\n\nA few months ago, I reviewed Avast One for Windows and found it to be a good solution. However, the Mac is a very different computer with unique hardware and software, so I tested Avast One for Mac to find out if it\u2019s a good fit for Apple\u2019s system and one of the best antivirus apps for your Mac.\n\nSpecs\n\nAvast One Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 5 (individual), 30 (family) Support Chat, email Price $180 Free version? Yes\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nAvast One\u2019s website describes its free tier as Basic, but the documentation refers to it as Avast One Essential. Either way, it\u2019s powerful antivirus software that protects your Mac for free. You get a malware scanner and browser protection to block malicious downloads. A free VPN is included but the monthly data is restricted to 5GB. Avast One offers one of the best free Mac antivirus apps available.\n\nIf you subscribe, more features are unlocked, and you can pick from three price tiers and a few variations. Avast One Silver starts at $36 annually with a choice of more protection, privacy, or performance features. Renewal costs are significantly higher than the first year, jumping to $80 in year two and beyond. You can get all three feature packs at once with the $60 Avast One Gold ($130 renewal).\n\nAvast One comes in family plans as well. For $84/$180, Avast One Silver Family increases the number of supported devices from the standard five to a generous 30, enough for everyone to enjoy protection. Avast One Gold Family costs $114/$280 to cover 30 devices.\n\nThe top tier is Avast One Platinum for $120/$300, a relatively minor increase from Avast One Gold Family that adds identity protection, dark web monitoring, and $2 million in identity theft insurance.\n\nDesign\n\nInstalling Avast One was simple, and much easier than my experience with McAfee\u2019s antivirus for Mac. After downloading the installer, a Finder window opened with a message to double-click it. After agreeing to the terms of use and allowing the required permissions, the installer placed itself in the trash and launched Avast One for setup.\n\nI started with the free version, Avast One Essential, initially skipping the sign-in option. The app guided me to enable Avast access in System Settings, opening the appropriate tabs along the way. After a few clicks, everything was ready in about a minute.\n\nI got a friendly message saying \u201cEverything looks good,\u201d but lacking enough details to convince me. I scrolled down to the shortcuts and found an option to run a system scan. The app updated its virus data, checked my browser caches, and scanned for malware. In the final step, it suggested file cleanup, giving me an option to upgrade to use this feature. I declined and moved to the next shortcut, the VPN.\n\nAfter allowing a pop-up approval request from macOS, the free VPN was switched on. It\u2019s capped at 5GB per month, which isn\u2019t enough for daily use, but could be useful for occasional checks or vacation planning.\n\nThe free app shows all the features in the explore tab, but some are locked until I subscribe. Still, plenty are available in Avast One Essential. The system scan checks for malware and includes a VPN, which is capped at 5GB per month.\n\nThe account tab shows my subscription level \u2014 currently none \u2014 and has subsections to set preferences, browse help documents, check the community forums, get support, or uninstall the app. It\u2019s refreshing to see an easy way to uninstall since removing antivirus software is sometimes difficult.\n\nFeatures\n\nAvast for Mac enjoys a near-perfect malware protection record in ongoing evaluations from the independent security research lab AV-Test. In fact, there were only two instances when Avast fell below a perfect six out of six.\n\nIn September 2020, a minor miss dropped AV-Test\u2019s rating to 5.5. The more notable flaw was from six years ago when Avast for Mac failed in 3.7% of the 241 malware tests performed in December 2018.\n\nEvery other quarterly test since December 2017 has been perfect. That\u2019s an impressive protection record that\u2018s almost as good as market leaders Bitdefender and Norton.\n\nWhile I trust AV-Test\u2019s results, I still wanted to spot-check for myself. I visited Wicar\u2019s malware test website to see how good the free web blocker was. Avast One Essential recognized all 13 browser exploits and malware downloads, blocking the danger at every turn.\n\nI tried again with the VPN switched off, and each threat was blocked without using any monthly data to safeguard my browsing. The free app is very good, a generous gift to the often overlooked Mac community.\n\nSwitching the VPN back on, I loaded BrowserLeaks website to check if my IP address was visible. The IP address and location shown were different from mine, so Avast\u2019s free VPN did its job.\n\nWith my Avast One Essential testing complete, I upgraded to Avast One Gold to continue with the subscriber version. That removed all locks on the explore tab, so I used the disk cleaner to free up over 4GB of app caches, trash, and log files.\n\nThere are plenty of extras that help with privacy, protection, and cleaning my Mac. The most important paid features are the uncapped VPN with an option to choose a server in another country to avoid geoblocking and live chat support.\n\nSupport\n\nAs an Avast One Gold subscriber, I requested priority support on the website via live chat. At first, I got a chatbot that misunderstood my question about how Avast One works. A multiple-choice selection let me switch to a live agent who immediately took over. After being speedy at first, the second response was much slower, and I had to repeat what I told the chatbot.\n\nIt was a bit frustrating, as if the agent didn\u2019t understand my question. I asked for another agent but they tried again to answer. After my second request to transfer, I was told to hold.\n\nUnfortunately, no one else was available, so I tried simplifying my question. That worked, and I got the answer I expected \u2014 Avast One protects my browser from malware and also scans my computer. I also asked some VPN questions and received prompt and accurate replies.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, suddenly the answers came quickly and with higher quality. I suspect the misunderstanding was a side effect of trying to help too many customers at once. That\u2019s the nature of live support, and it will always vary.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with Avast\u2019s support via live chat.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nAccording to Avast\u2019s privacy policy, Avast One\u2019s free app might show targeted ads. In my brief test, I didn\u2019t see any, but I quickly switched to a paid plan to complete the review.\n\nThe end-user license agreement allows Avast to send you promotional offers to upgrade to a higher-priced subscription. After three months on Avast\u2019s mailing list, I haven\u2019t noticed many emails, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be concerned about.\n\nHowever, Avast has had some privacy issues in the past. Google removed the Avast browser extension in 2019 for spying on Chrome users.\n\nAfter five years of behaving kindly, Avast has well-rated security extensions in the Chrome Web Store. I think it\u2019s safe to let those worries fade away.\n\nAvast One protects your Mac and MacBook\n\nIf you like the sound of Avast One\u2019s subscription plans but want to save money, check our guide to the best antivirus deals. Sometimes Avast has sales that cut first-year costs even lower. Still, the costs will skyrocket to more than double the first year when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nAvast\u2019s parent company, Gen Digital, also owns Norton Security. Norton 360 for Mac has a better subscription package at lower prices, so that\u2019s a better choice if you\u2019re paying for protection.\n\nAvast One Basic (Essential) is a nice, free antivirus that could provide everything you need. It includes prevention and protection just as powerful as what\u2019s in the paid version. If you want more, our guide to the best antivirus software breaks down features and costs to help you make an informed purchase."

        "article_content": "OnePlus knows how to make some of the best Android phones around, but its software has historically lagged behind Samsung, Google and Apple. That's been even more the case since these companies began to embrace the AI feature trend, with OnePlus deliberately avoiding major discussions of AI features. But things may be about to change.\n\nOxygenOS 15, the OnePlus-flavored skin of Android 15, is entering open beta from October 30th, but I've been lucky enough to try it out on a OnePlus 12 early. And it looks like OnePlus has more than caught up with the competition.\n\nA fully-fledged suite of AI features has been added to the incoming software update, but there are more upgrades and improvements besides that. So even if generative writing and image editing tools aren't your thing, you'll likely find something to enjoy in the changes OnePlus has made to its interface, animations or even just the software's overall size.\n\nThe OnePlus 13, the company's next flagship phone, isn't expected to arrive outside of China until the start of 2025, and it'll probably be another few months after that before we'll see another budget Nord handset. But with this update on the way, perhaps existing OnePlus owners will be happy to keep their current phone going, knowing that they're not being left behind.\n\nLighter and more agile\n\nEven before you make your first tap in the revamped OxygenOS 15 interface, it's given you a benefit. Thanks to optimization efforts and the removal of unnecessary files (such as default wallpapers you're not using), OnePlus has removed 5GB, or about 20%, from the storage footprint of OxygenOS 14, giving the user that space back for storing things they need and care about.\n\nWhen you do finally wake up the phone, you'll first want to check out the new lock screen options, described as \"Flux themes\". These are designed to have beautifully smooth transitions from always-on-display to lock screen to home screen, and while it doesn't make a huge practical difference, it is nice to see the animations move smoothly between one another as you open up your phone.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nSmooth animations is one of OnePlus' main talking points this year, especially when it comes to opening, closing and switching between apps. OxygenOS 15 features a new \"Parallel Processing\" graphics system, which allows apps opening and closing (and their associated animations) to overlap. It's a solution to a very minor complaint (jittery animations when swapping rapidly between apps) but it certainly works as a party piece for OnePlus.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

You can only open two apps at a time, rather than the Open or Pad 2's three, but you still get the all-important ability to expand and shrink both apps as you see fit, and tap between them to multitask without compromising on in-app space. It's much better for immediate work or copy/pasting across apps than any other system I've tried, and I'm delighted to find it on a smaller, more accessible device.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\niPhone-inspired improvements\n\nAs seems to be the trend among Android skins these days, OxygenOS 15 now offers an iOS-style split between the notifications shade and quick settings, which you access by swiping down from the top of the phone on the left side or the right. I never had a problem with the traditional Android all-in-one style, and that is still offered for those who prefer it. But it is weird how this is an interface style OnePlus and other brands are now all adopting, seven years after the iPhone X first introduced it.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nAnother iPhone-esque feature is the new Live Alert pop-ups for ongoing activities, like playing music or running a timer. It lives around the central punch-hole camera on the OnePlus 12, like a smaller version of the Dynamic Island it's aping. I do like this change, as it gives you immediate access to an ongoing task no matter where else you go on the phone. And if it's annoying you, you can swipe on the bubble to dismiss it.\n\nAlso on the topic of iPhones, OnePlus is trying to bridge the gap with its rival through the upcoming Share with iPhone feature. By downloading a to-be-release \"O+ Connect\" app, you'll be able to send your files to your friends with iPhones as easily as you can to those with Android phones.\n\nI didn't get to try this one, but if it works as OnePlus says, then it's going to be a big moment for iPhone-Android relations, making it far simpler to send things to one another directly rather than through a messaging app or Google Drive.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nAI, the OnePlus way\n\nOnePlus still isn't devoting its phone to AI in the same way that other brands have, but its new software adds a lot of the basic AI-driven services we have seen from other recent smartphones, plus some unique ones to let OnePlus flex its software talents.\n\nOn the photography side, the OnePlus Photos app now contains Image Unblur and Reflection Eraser tools for fixing up common problems with images. But another addition is Detail Boost, which is there to sharpen a cropped-in image with generative AI. It doesn't seem great if your image has text in it (see the street sign in my sample) but for larger, simpler elements, it does add back some of the definition lost in the crop.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nFor your productivity needs, you can now summarize writing, read it out or get some help with editing it with the AI Summary, AI Speak and AI Writer tools. These are available anywhere in OxygenOS 15 by swiping in from the side of the screen to access the relevant toolbar. The AI Writer tools can reformat your text, change its tone or just check your spelling and grammar, but there are also generative writing options to try too. This can either write something entirely new for you, such as a reply to a message, or be used to add to existing text, say if you need a few more words to round out a briefing.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nIf you save a lot of documents to your phone, then the new Intelligent Search for local files will work especially well for you. The home screen search menu will be able to look through the text of indexed files to help you find answers you're looking for without opening them. And for questions that have answers beyond the scope of your phone's storage, Circle to Search is available too, if you were jealous of Samsung and Google keeping it to themselves for the past 10 months.\n\nOxygenOS 15: Outlook\n\nOne last feature before we round things up \u2014 the all-important new software easter egg. If you type 1+= in the Calculator app, you get a special animation displaying the company motto.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nI'm glad that I didn't have to mention this little addition until the end, since OnePlus has made plenty of meaningful changes to OxygenOS to make it a more futureproof Android skin. I still want to see this running on a OnePlus 13 before I make up my mind in full, but I like what I'm seeing so far.\n\nSamsung has yet to fully reveal its new Android 15 skin, One UI 7, and Google's no doubt cooking up some new features for future Pixel Feature Drops, so OnePlus' new software may start looking outdated faster than it might like. But right now we've got a proper three-horse race on our hands when it comes to Android phones, which must give OnePlus' faithful Never Settlers some comfort that they've bet on the right brand."
