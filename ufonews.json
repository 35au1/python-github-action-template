            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more-modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York / New Jersey / Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still less than 20, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, less than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine-chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deep fakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a new cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C. the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. it\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios\u2019 were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\"\n\nAn official for the Department of Defence stated that while there is no suggestion 'malicious intent' in regards to the mysterious sightings, they 'don't know' the origin.\n\nNally has also shared his belief that aliens are able to quickly enter and exit Earth's atmosphere via a series of 'portals', with one of these being situation between the Irish towns of Athlone and Slane.\n\nAdvert\n\nCarl Natty claims the sightings are for another reason (The Morning Show)\n\nWhich certainly contradicts the widely held idea that aliens would make first contact with mankind by plonking themselves down on the White House lawn, but hey, the real world doesn't always revolve around the US.\n\nHowever before you start stockpiling tins of beans and multipacks of loo roll, Nally is keen to remind us that there are greater threats to humanity than aliens.\n\n\"f you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nAdvert\n\nGlad to see we've all got our priorities in order."

Throughout several weeks of these sightings, numerous similar reports of UFO activity have gone unexplained by authorities.\n\nCornwallLive reports there have been unexplained lights seen in the night sky in St. Cleer, Porthtowan, and Newquay. The latest UFO encounter was filmed by a dog walker at around 7:18 p.m. last Monday.\n\nAccording to the witness, the UFO hovered in the sky for about 10 minutes before slowly moving south. They were able to capture some video footage of the UFO as they were approaching the Royal Airforce Base in the area.\n\nThe dog walker said they believe the UFO they saw is linked to another recent sighting in Newquay. The sighting in Newquay occurred on the same day, Dec. 9 at around 6:30 p.m.\n\nThat UFO sighting was caught on video by a woman named Monique Lyle, who described what she saw from her balcony as \u201clike something out of a science fiction movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw the object, I was completely taken aback,\u201d she said. \u201cI often stargaze, so I\u2019m familiar with the night sky, and I knew immediately that this wasn\u2019t a star or any usual phenomenon like an aircraft. It was bright, changing colors, and seemed unusually close to town.\u201d\n\nAnother recent UFO sighting in the area by photographer Chris Piper occurred in St. Cleer on Dec. 15. He captured what he described as a \u201cblue or white object\u201d in some video he had taken of the full moon that evening.\n\n\u201cI was photographing the lunar halo and it wasn\u2019t until I showed [the pictures] to my friend that he noticed the blue dot hovering around the moon,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhen I looked back at the motion pictures, it appeared to be moving.\u201d\n\nWhile all of these UFO sightings in and around Cornwall have gone unexplained, as have many of the supposed drone sightings in the United States, one expert believes they could all be a precursor to an alien invasion."

(KPTV) - UFOs, drones, mysterious lights in the air, there have been multiple unexplained sightings here in Oregon over the last week, but do they have a logical explanation? The Director of Oregon\u2019s Department of Aviation seems to think so.\n\nAccording to ODAV officials, more often than not, lights in the sky are supposed to be there and their origins are from Earth.\n\nLast week a video taken by a life flight pilot flying near Eugene Oregon got a lot of national attention. The pilot described seeing a red light flying incredibly fast and in a corkscrew pattern tens of thousands of feet in the air. Initially, it was written off as a mystery.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nFOX 12 Now is joined by James Szubski of Margie's Outdoor Store in Bingen, Wash. They receive and file reports on UFO sightings in the Northwest.\n\nBut now the director of Oregon\u2019s Department of Aviation, Kenji Sugahara, said there are several explanations of what those lights could have been.\n\n\u201cOff the coast of Oregon there is a military training ground so the Air National Guard tend to do a lot of missions out there that might not appear on ADSP which is the beacon that some planes have,\u201d Sugahara said.\n\nSugahara also pointed out Oregon is home to three UAS drone testing sites in Pendleton, Tillamook and McMinnville, which is close to where these pilots reported these mysterious lights.\n\n\u201cPilots are humans as well they can see things that they might not be able to process or understand,\u201d Sugahara said. \u201cIn Tillamook especially they have balloons that go thousands of feet high as a part of their testing that could be unfamiliar to not only the general public but also to trained professional pilots.\u201d\n\nSugahara wanted to remind the community that it is a state and federal crime to shoot at or point a laser at an aircraft, manned or not. Anyone who is concerned about something flying overhead should instead call 911.\n\n\u201cWhen they are drones that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are there for nefarious purposes if you see them and they have lights on they are there for them to be seen,\u201d Sugahara said.\n\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX.

Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe app had \"10+\" downloads on Google Play and one rating on the Apple App Store as of Wednesday. It is billed as a \"unique place where people from every background, race, and walk of life come together in a place of community and purpose\" and offers users prayer and spiritual guidance from an AI version of the 54-year-old Carpenter.\n\nA video demonstration shared online by Protestia features Carpenter using the app to request \"Pastor Ron\" to pray for recovery from an illness.\n\n\"I love to have my own personal pastor,\" Carpenter tells the camera as he demonstrates how the app responds with an automated message in Carpenter's voice. The pastor ended the short video by urging his followers to \"stay tuned\" to find out more information.\n\nPowered by Innovatix AI, the app also requires users to sign up for a $49 monthly plan to access \"unlimited\" calls and messages with the AI pastor.\n\nCarpenter's personal website also features an apparent link to the Advanced Archive app, which appeared broken as of Wednesday afternoon. The site does not reference the Advanced Archive app anywhere else.\n\nCP reached out to Carpenter for comment. This story will be updated if a response is received.\n\nThe mainstreaming of AI has already changed how some pastors approach their sermons, with some churches opting to try ChatGPT and other large language models to generate their messages for Sunday mornings.\n\nPastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills has warned against the rise of AI among churches, saying that the level of deception in the Church is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as technology rapidly advances.\n\n\"I don't say this to scare you; I say this to prepare you,\" Hibbs said in October 2023. \"There is a level of deception coming both in and out of the Church that is going to rock the world. It has to. God promised it would come. It would be an indicator of the last days.\"\n\nHibbs warned when it comes to AI, \"we are now starting to see things come to pass where you don't know if what you're looking at is true or not.\"\n\n\"You can't even tell anymore if that person's voice is assigned to the actual individual. Is that really Billy Graham's voice, or is that really this actor's voice or that singer's voice? Or is it artificial intelligence?\n\n\"How are you going to know truth from error?\" Hibbs asked.\n\nStressing the need for discernment among believers, Hibbs implored his congregation to \"more than ever, read the Bible.\"\n\n\"Pray to God. Stop listening to what people are saying. Judge everything you hear against the Bible.\""

            "article_content": "Some of OpenAI\u2019s announcements for its \u201c12 Days\u201d event of ChatGPT novelties were easy to guess. The full release of ChatGPT o1, ChatGPT Search going public, and the official Sora rollout are some of the things you could have seen coming. But the 1-800-ChatGPT toll-free number that OpenAI announced on Wednesday is something that definitely wasn\u2019t on my list.\n\nI did not see ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode getting regular phone call support, which is what the 1-800 number will do for you. It\u2019s an incredibly gimmicky feature that will do more for OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT marketing department than for users.\n\nThe 1-800 number will give you 15 minutes of free chat with the AI per month in the US and Canada. It works from any kind of phone, including old flip phones and rotary home phones. OpenAI demoed both during the short livestream. But the more exciting feature is having ChatGPT support in WhatsApp.\n\nYou can use the same number to talk to ChatGPT in the popular chat app. There are no limits, and the phone works worldwide. That\u2019s less gimmicky than calling a phone number to talk to ChatGPT, and I think it\u2019s a big attack on Meta\u2019s Meta AI.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMeta AI is a ChatGPT-like product from Meta. The company formerly known as Facebook bundled Meta AI with all its social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. If you use any of these apps, you have access to Meta AI right now, or it\u2019s coming soon. Meta couldn\u2019t give Meta AI a worldwide release, as some markets require special attention. That\u2019s the EU, of course.\n\nOnce Meta AI becomes available, you can\u2019t disable it. You can avoid using it in any of those apps, but Meta AI is now built into all of Meta\u2019s social networks.\n\nBringing ChatGPT into WhatsApp via the 1-800-ChatGPT number is easily an attack on Meta AI, one that Meta can\u2019t really respond to. Suddenly, WhatsApp users can talk to the AI they might prefer right inside WhatsApp instead of the one available by default.\n\nJust look at the demo OpenAI offered. The user moves between a chat with a person to a chat with ChatGPT to ask a question. They could ask Meta AI the same question, as the Meta AI search/composer field is seen right at the top of chats in WhatsApp.\n\nYou can now talk to ChatGPT by calling 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) in the U.S. or by sending a WhatsApp message to the same number\u2014available everywhere ChatGPT is. pic.twitter.com/R0XOPut7Qw \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 18, 2024\n\nTo chat with ChatGPT in WhatsApp, save the 1-800 number in your contacts. Then, type your questions and prompts, and the AI will answer.\n\nAs a longtime ChatGPT user, I\u2019ll never chat with the chatbot via WhatsApp. I\u2019ll use the standalone ChatGPT apps or the website. However, plenty of smartphone owners are still new to the AI game. They might be aware of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Meta AI, but they might not use any of them. The WhatsApp integration gives OpenAI another way of promoting its AI services to consumers who aren\u2019t using AI chatbots.\n\nThe WhatsApp access might be the gateway drug that gets them to install the ChatGPT apps. From there, they might consider premium access for the AI. And it\u2019ll all happen in an app that comes with built-in Meta AI access.\n\nWill it actually work? We\u2019ll have to wait and see whether OpenAI shares any stats on 1-800 calls and WhatsApp engagement. At the very least, it\u2019s a great marketing tactic worth pursuing.\n\nAs for the actual WhatsApp chats with ChatGPT, the privacy implications aren\u2019t clear here. You\u2019d use the service without an account. Also, WhatsApp chats should be end-to-end encrypted so the chat content is only visible to the two parties.\n\nBut one party is an AI that might have instructions to export some of those chats to OpenAI for safety reasons or to improve the service. After all, the toll-free number warns you that the call might be recorded.\n\nAlso, the WhatsApp service can potentially give OpenAI access to plenty of phone numbers that can be targeted with ChatGPT promo texts. It might never happen; I\u2019m speculating here. But OpenAI will want to increase its customer base, so that\u2019s one way to do it.\n\nOpenAI could also match some of those numbers to existing ChatGPT accounts. But again, if you have a ChatGPT account, you wouldn\u2019t really want the WhatsApp experience."

Kentucky Coal Museum\n\nA Coal Miner's Home exhibit at the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum features furnishings found in many coal miners' homes.\n\n231 Main St. Benham, 40807; Tuesday-Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. and Sunday 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no place is more qualified to portray the realities of life in a coal mine than Benham, Kentucky. Once a coal camp, this tiny eastern Kentucky town is now home to the Kentucky Coal Museum. The museum encapsulates what life as a coal miner would have been like. Given the significance of coal mining in the commonwealth's history, the preserved history of the industry that countless Kentuckians devoted their careers to may be of interest to Kentuckians from all over.\n\n2. Vent Haven Museum\n\nA room filled from floor to ceiling with ventriloquist dummies at the Vent Haven Museum in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky. June 30, 2020\n\n33 West Maple Ave., Fort Mitchell; Open by appointment only May 1 through Sept. 30.\n\nIn the northern Kentucky city of Fort Mitchell resides the \"world's only museum dedicated to ventriloquism,\" according to the Vent Haven Museum's website. While many people may balk at the idea of entering a building occupied by more than 1,200 dummies and related memorabilia dating back to the 19th century, the museum's founder, W.S. Berger, spent decades collecting the items. Berger died in 1972, and the museum opened in 1973 after he formed a charitable organization to ensure his collection stayed intact.\n\n3. Great American Dollhouse Museum\n\n344 Swope Drive, Danville; Wednesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith more than 200 dollhouses, model buildings and box rooms that capture astonishing detail with their designs and furnishings, the Great American Dollhouse Museum is a window into worlds from several U.S. time periods and regions, including the Colonial period, the Old West, and modern eras, according to the museum's website. Other sections of the museum include a miniature scene mimicking a 1910s town, and a fantasy-inspired sections replete with mythical creatures like elves, witches and trolls.\n\n4. International Paranormal Museum and Research Center\n\nA section of the International Paranormal Museum and Research Center dedicated to aliens.\n\nClosed until spring of 2025 for relocation.\n\nThe International Paranormal Museum and Research Center in Somerset is a hub for people interested in the inexplicable phenomena that grip the imagination of humankind \u2014 from ghosts to cryptids to aliens. The organization investigates these subjects and collects artifacts found along the way to display to the public.\n\nThe museum is in the process of moving out of its home of seven years and anticipates reopening in Spring 2025, though its new location has not yet been announced. Rest assured, if you've yet to experience this attraction, the museum's management is confident they'll come back better than ever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Dinosaur World Kentucky\n\n711 Mammoth Cave Road, Cave City; Open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're young or young at heart, you can help your imagination soar back to the time of the dinosaurs by heading to Cave City. Dinosaur World is an outdoor museum with hundreds of life-sized dinosaurs on display that also offers a host of educational activities that allow children to search for and examine fossils and minerals.\n\nContact reporter Killian Baarlaer at kbaarlaer@gannett.com or at @bkillian72 on X.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Weird museums: 5 unique Kentucky museums to visit in 2025"

After digging a little deeper, they found two more teeth just below the surface. Realizing the find might be something special, the homeowner called in experts, and soon a full excavation was underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the teeth and held them in my hands, I knew they were something special,\u201d said the homeowner. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that our yard had something so important for science.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers uncovered a well-preserved jaw belonging to an adult mastodon, an ancient relative of today\u2019s elephants. The jaw will now be studied to figure out how old it is, what the mastodon ate and what its life was like during the Ice Age.\n\n\u201cThis jaw is an amazing discovery,\u201d said Dr. Robert Feranec, an expert from the New York State Museum. \u201cFossils like this help us learn about ancient ecosystems and give us clues about how the world has changed over time.\u201d\n\nA backyard in Orange County, New York, became the site of an incredible discovery of a complete mastodon jaw -- the first find like it in New York in more than 11 years.

In fact, about one-third of the 150 mastodon fossils found in New York have come from this area.\n\nDr. Cory Harris from SUNY Orange said they hope to keep digging in the area to see if there are more bones waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cThe jaw is the most exciting part, but the toe and rib fragments might also help us learn more about this animal,\u201d Dr. Harris explained.\n\nThe jaw will eventually be displayed at the New York State Museum in 2025, after scientists finish their research, according to Michael Mastroianni, a leader at the museum."

            "article_content": "ZDNET\n\nIBM is zooming along with new open-source Granite Large Language Models (LLM) releases every few months. Granite 3.1 is the latest generation model, building upon the success of Granite 3.0. The model offers enhanced capabilities and performance optimized for business applications.\n\nAlso: Gemini Advanced users can now access Google's most experimental model\n\nThe family of Granite 3.1 models boasts an impressive 128K token context window, a substantial increase from their predecessors. This expansion allows the models to process and understand much larger amounts of text -- equivalent to approximately 85,000 English words -- enabling more comprehensive analysis and generation tasks. By comparison, OpenAI's ChatGPT 3, which ignited the AI revolution, could handle only 2,000 tokens.\n\nOutperforming the competition\n\nBig Blue claims its new Granite 8B Instruct model outperforms its rivals, such as Google Gemma 2, Meta Llama 3.1, and Qwen 2.5, on HuggingFace's OpenLLM Leaderboard benchmarks.\n\nAlso: Want generative AI LLMs integrated with your business data? You need RAG\n\nThe Granite 3.1 family includes dense models and Mixture of Experts (MoE) variants. IBM states its Granite 2B and 8B models are text-only dense LLMs trained on over 12 trillion data tokens. The dense models are designed to support tool-based use cases and for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), streamlining code generation, translation, and bug fixing.\n\nThe MoE models are trained on over 10 trillion tokens of data. IBM claims these models are ideal for deployment in on-device applications with low latency.\n\nImproved graphics and language capabilities\n\nThe new release also introduces image-in/text-out functionality, broadening the models' applicability for businesses working with graphics.\n\nGranite 3.1 also offers improved foreign language proficiency. Alongside English, it can now work with a dozen languages, including German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, Czech, Italian, Korean, Dutch, and Simplified Chinese. In short, if you have an international business, IBM has an LLM you can use.\n\nAs before, the new Granite LLMs are licensed under the Apache 2 open-source license. IBM also maintains its commitment to openness by disclosing the training datasets and providing comprehensive documentation on model development and performance.\n\nAlso: Generative AI brings new risks to everyone. Here's how you can stay safe\n\nIf you're worried about intellectual property issues and AI, IBM offers an uncapped indemnity for third-party IP claims related to the use of its models. You may not be concerned about such potential legal problems yet, but I assure you that you will be.\n\nPowerful, trustworthy AI for enterprises\n\nGranite 3.1 models are available on IBM's Watsonx platform; cloud service providers like Google Vertex AI; and AI platforms including Hugging Face, NVIDIA (as NIM microservices), Ollama, and Replicate.\n\nThe release of Granite 3.1 is poised to accelerate AI adoption in enterprise settings. By combining these models with proprietary data using techniques like IBM's InstructLab, businesses can potentially achieve task-specific performance rivaling larger models at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAs the AI landscape evolves rapidly, IBM's Granite 3.1 represents a significant step forward in providing enterprises with powerful, efficient, and trustworthy AI tools to drive innovation and solve complex business challenges."

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

            "article_content": "The Global Dairy Trade (GDT) took a bit of a wallop this week, with the index dropping by 2.8%, which was higher than expected.\n\nThe main reductions was for powders, with whole milk powder (WMP) dropping by 2.9% and skim milk powder (SMP) dropping by the same.\n\nBoth anhydrous milk fat (AMF) and butter fell also by 3.8% and 0.6% respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s the first significant drop in the GDT for months, with the last time the index falling significantly being in July. Since then, it has been rising steadily, with just one or two small reductions.\n\nThe overall index remains in a very good place, with prices historically high relative to 2023 and the pre-pandemic years.\n\nIn Europe, prices seemed to settle this week, particularly for butter, with the market nudging up by \u20ac55/t. When considering the decline in prices in recent weeks this is a really good result.\n\nAverage butter prices are now \u20ac7,185/t and while significantly lower than they were three weeks ago, it\u2019s a good price if it extends into the new year and beyond.\n\nWMP and cheddar are much more stable in Europe, with WMP up \u20ac10/t and cheddar down \u20ac10/t. SMP has been under a bit more pressure in the European market and at the GDT, as it fell by \u20ac30/t this week in Europe and is currently trading at \u20ac76/t behind the GDT price, indicating limited appetite in Europe for skim.\n\nAs dairy markets wind down for Christmas, next year\u2019s outlook is less certain, but futures are predicting prices to come down for almost all categories."

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world races towards 2025, Developer examines what lies ahead for software development in the new year.\n\nAmong the most pressing trends for 2025 are AI development simplification, the integration of cross-functional engineering teams, and the evolution of DevSecOps practices. These shifts promise to redefine how companies approach innovation, security, and efficiency in their development pipelines.\n\nAI-powered development simplification\n\nAvthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale, predicts a significant transformation in the tech stack landscape by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe traditional tech stack will continue to collapse,\u201d Sewrathan notes, highlighting advancements driven by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development. This shift is anticipated to empower engineers of all skill levels to create impactful AI applications with ease.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, the traditional tech stack will continue to collapse, fueled by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development,\u201d Sewrathan explains. \u201cCompanies that deliver frictionless, accessible solutions with low barriers to entry will empower engineers to create impactful AI apps, no matter their level of expertise.\u201d\n\nThis democratisation of AI app creation is expected to increase competition within the industry as more developers gain access to advanced capabilities. Consistency and reliability in AI applications are also set to become paramount.\n\n\u201cAs AI apps become central to everyday interactions in 2025, consistency and reliability will take precedence,\u201d Sewrathan observes.\n\nDeveloper role evolution\n\nIndu Keri, General Manager and Head of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud at Nutanix, envisions a new era of software development starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cSoftware development and engineering is already being democratised with tools like Copilot,\u201d Keri says.\n\nBy combining GenAI with low-code solutions, code will be abstracted to the point of irrelevance. AI will generate applications rather than code, enabling developers to step into strategic roles.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day for developers will change drastically,\u201d Keri notes. \u201cNo longer hamstrung by grunt work, developers will step into an up-leveled, strategic role\u2014communicating with decision-makers about how tech can solve business problems.\u201d\n\nThis evolution, Keri argues, complements developers\u2019 best qualities \u2013 creativity and innovation \u2013 and challenges them to grow into leadership roles within their organisations.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, engineers at any level will be able to create an AI app through the widespread availability of APIs and models,\u201d Sewrathan adds. \u201cBut the differentiators will be consistency, usability, and customer impact.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI and DevOps automation\n\nThe hype around agentic AI will reach boiling point in 2025 as organisations bundle specialised agents for different stages of software delivery, including code generation, testing, and quality assurance. This orchestrator-driven approach will drive a more intelligent approach to DevOps automation.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, says: \u201cInstead of having one, basic GenAI assistant, organisations will bundle together specialised agents for the different stages of software delivery\u2014such as code generation, testing, and quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne agent will act as the orchestrator, directing the others and producing more accurate insights into the end-to-end process.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Coutinho of OutSystems highlights that agentic AI will answer many, but not all, business problems: \u201cFor the last few years, businesses have tried to throw GenAI at all of their problems. The result: GenAI is a remarkable solution for many use cases, but not everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn AI tool is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. Just because tech titans are pushing agentic AI right now doesn\u2019t mean you should scrap simpler solutions. Align your AI strategy with your organisation\u2019s needs, rather than the latest shiny object.\u201d\n\nIntegration of cross-functional engineering teams\n\nMoving beyond AI development, the prediction for cross-functional engineering teams is another area of significant change. Reynolds outlines a future where standalone DevOps teams are phased out in favour of more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, organisations will move away from standalone DevOps teams towards more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines,\u201d Reynolds explains.\n\nThis shift towards unified cross-functional teams is expected to eliminate the remaining silos between software delivery teams and accelerate innovation at a whole new level. To support these integrated teams, organisations will increasingly adopt unified platforms providing capabilities across the entire software delivery lifecycle\u2014from CI/CD to chaos engineering and cloud cost management.\n\nIn line with these platform shifts, Reynolds emphasises the importance of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) that enable engineers to self-serve the solutions and data they need.\n\n\u201cTo maximise the value of these platforms,\u201d Reynolds advises,\u201c[organisations] will expose these capabilities through IDPs.\u201d\n\nEvolution of DevSecOps practices\n\nThe software development landscape is also witnessing a significant evolution in DevSecOps practices.\n\nDylan Thomas, Senior Director of Product Engineering at OpenText Cybersecurity, predicts that, by 2025, DevSecOps will evolve beyond the \u201cshift-left\u201d paradigm to embrace a more mature \u201cshift everywhere\u201d approach.\n\nThis shift will require organisations to apply the right tools at the right stages of the DevSecOps cycle, improving efficiency and effectiveness in security practices.\n\n\u201cLightweight analysis in IDEs will help developers catch issues early,\u201d Thomas elaborates. \u201cAutomation integrated into pull requests and CI/CD pipelines will ensure a cohesive \u2018integrate once\u2019 approach for core functions such as SAST, SCA, and increasingly DAST, particularly for API security testing.\u201d\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline the development process while enhancing overall security.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) maturity\n\nOne of the critical components in this evolving landscape is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nGovernment mandates are driving organisations to adopt SBOMs at scale, requiring them not only to generate these documents but also to make them actionable.\n\nWhile producing SBOMs in standard formats is now routine, the real challenge lies in translating raw data into meaningful risk-based insights.\n\nDevSecOps practices will mature, leveraging tools like VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) to add critical context to SBOMs\u2014reducing inefficiencies in vendor-consumer relationships and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s role in managing complex data types\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s extension capabilities are also anticipated to play a significant role in managing complex data types in one place.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, PostgreSQL will solidify its position as the go-to \u2018everything database\u2019\u2014the first to fully integrate AI functionality like embeddings directly within its core ecosystem,\u201d says Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale.\n\n\u201cThis will streamline data workflows, eliminate the need for external processing tools, and enable businesses to manage complex data types in one place.\u201d\n\nAs companies move towards integrated solutions that can handle diverse datasets without relying on standalone or specialised databases, PostgreSQL is leading the charge towards this future state.\n\nDiverse app stores will reshape mobile distribution\n\nThe app store ecosystem is poised for a significant shift as mobile carriers are expected to regain their influence over app distribution.\n\nMatt Tubergen, EVP of Global Strategy & Partnerships at Digital Turbine, said: \u201cThe app store ecosystem is set to shift away from an Apple and Google duopoly to an open landscape as mobile carriers regain the power to connect consumers with apps.\u201d\n\nEmerging regulatory changes are also playing a critical role in leveling the playing field. These include bans that prevent tech giants like Google from incentivising app store preloads, which allow carriers and device manufacturers to preload their own apps on new devices.\n\nThis newfound autonomy positions carriers as pivotal players in alternative app distribution.\n\n\u201cThis renewed autonomy positions carriers as critical players in alternative app distribution, enabling organic growth for alternative app stores,\u201d Tubergen notes.\n\nCarriers are expected to offer developers better revenue opportunities than those provided by Apple and Google, while consumers will benefit from a more diverse selection of apps.\n\nTubergen points out that \u201cthe new, open app store economy will prioritise the needs of developers and users, shifting away from the current model that only serves Apple and Google.\u201d This shift promises a competitive and decentralised landscape where developers gain more control over their revenue streams.\n\nConsumers are expected to enjoy access to a wider variety of apps curated and tailored to their preferences. With third-party app stores gaining influence and major players like Epic Games and Microsoft advocating for inclusivity, the global app distribution model is likely to expand and mirror the thriving alternative stores seen in Asia.\n\nThis evolution promises an inclusive, innovative, and consumer-focused mobile distribution ecosystem.\n\nEmergence of xOps\n\nThe convergence of DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps into a new \u201cxOps\u201d paradigm is expected as more traditional applications adopt AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u2018AI-aware\u2019 Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities,\u201d explains Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai.\n\nIncreasing security challenges\n\nWhile AI-generated code can significantly increase developer efficiency, it also introduces security risks due to increased volume of code that must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors.\n\n\u201cWhile research has shown that generative AI can halve the time it takes developers to complete coding tasks, the increased volume of code being produced must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors,\u201d warns Holt.\n\n\u201cThis will increase security risk and lead to additional toil in the later stages of delivery, wiping out any efficiency gains from AI-generated code.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in supply-chain attacks. This is likely to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAaron Costello, Chief of SaaS Security Research at AppOmni, observes: \u201cThe past few years, we\u2019ve seen a steady uptick in supply-chain attacks on SaaS through compromised third-party applications. As a result, organisations are placing these integrations and their requested access levels under far more scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy research into data exposures has shown that often no initial foothold is needed for threat actors to gain access to the sensitive data they want. The combination of undocumented legacy API endpoints, over-privileged public access, and gaps in vendor logging capabilities will continue to provide a dangerously effective option for threat actors to execute hit-and-run style attacks.\u201d\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nDespite the increasing security challenges, a failure to secure software could have ever more serious repercussions. In light of increasing awareness and demand for reliable software systems, developers must prepare for heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, comments: \u201cIn the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, there will be an increase in regulatory pressure around poor-quality software.\u201d\n\nGlobal regulators are expected to introduce more stringent standards that extend beyond existing frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). This response is driven by a growing sentiment among consumers; a recent survey conducted by Harness found that ~74% of consumers believe there should be regulations holding companies accountable for poor-quality software updates leading to IT outages.\n\nTo navigate these impending regulatory changes, organisations supporting critical infrastructure \u2013 such as banking, healthcare, and energy services \u2013 must proactively enhance their software testing protocols.\n\n\u201cThey will need well-defined response plans to ensure they can recover quickly when the unexpected happens,\u201d Reynolds notes. Implementing modern software delivery practices is crucial, including feature flags and canary deployments, which enable continuous improvement in code quality and more stable release cycles.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, organisations not only bolster software resilience but also enhance trust and brand loyalty among consumers. As regulations evolve to emphasise software reliability akin to cybersecurity standards, being proactive will be key to supporting business growth and staying ahead of regulatory measures. This approach not only mitigates risks but positions companies favorably in a landscape where quality is increasingly synonymous with competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the predictions for 2025 paint a picture of an industry bracing for radical transformation\u2014driven by advancements in AI development, cross-functional engineering teams, and mature DevSecOps practices. These changes promise to accelerate innovation while enhancing security and user experience across industries.\n\nSee also: PostgreSQL becomes developers\u2019 choice for AI and real-time apps\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

Marts will also close next week for Christmas holidays.\n\nCows\n\nAs with prime cattle, there is plenty of demand for good-quality cull cows, especially younger animals.\n\nBase quotes have moved up 4p/kg to 400p/kg for O+3 grading animals, with deals of 410p to 430p/kg on offer for good-quality suckler types.\n\nNI sheep: deals at 700p/kg for lambs\n\nThe live trade for fat lamb remains strong, with exporters and agents for Irish factories very active for heavy lots, pushing prices well above \u00a3160 and topping \u00a3171.\n\nAt the plants, the best quote is 680p/kg, but deals are being reported at 700p/kg to match the live ring.\n\nIn Gortin, heavy lambs were a strong trade, with 25kg to 27kg making \u00a3163 to \u00a3170, 24kg to \u00a3155.50 and 23kg to \u00a3143.\n\nKilrea sold a big show of 1,850 lambs from 630p to 684p/kg, no change on last week. Light lambs at 19kg made \u00a3130, 18.5kg at \u00a3126.50, 24kg sold to \u00a3161.50 and 23kg to \u00a3154.50.\n\nIn Markethill, 1,160 lambs sold from 630p to 687p/kg, little change on last week. Saintfield sold 600 lambs from 620p to 700p/kg in a steady trade. Texels at 32kg made \u00a3171, with 25.5kg Charolais at \u00a3160. There was a big run from \u00a3147 to \u00a3160. Lighter sorts at 20kg made \u00a3124.\n\nIn Ballymena, store lambs were a strong trade. Mules hit \u00a3162 and \u00a3140, with a run of Texels from \u00a3125 to \u00a3137.\n\nA big sale of 1,800 fat lambs were also a steady trade. Lambs at 24.5kg made \u00a3162.50, 24kg at \u00a3159.50, 22kg made \u00a3148 and 21kg at \u00a3147.\n\nFat ewes\n\nThe trade for fat ewes is strong this week. In Gortin, ewes topped \u00a3248, with a run from \u00a3134 to \u00a322. In Kilrea, top was \u00a3250. In Saintfield, the best Texels made \u00a3270 and \u00a3260, with a big run from \u00a3168 to \u00a3238.\n\nRead more\n\nSuckler cows in freefall as 50,000 gone"

After digging a little deeper, they found two more teeth just below the surface. Realizing the find might be something special, the homeowner called in experts, and soon a full excavation was underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the teeth and held them in my hands, I knew they were something special,\u201d said the homeowner. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that our yard had something so important for science.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers uncovered a well-preserved jaw belonging to an adult mastodon, an ancient relative of today\u2019s elephants. The jaw will now be studied to figure out how old it is, what the mastodon ate and what its life was like during the Ice Age.\n\n\u201cThis jaw is an amazing discovery,\u201d said Dr. Robert Feranec, an expert from the New York State Museum. \u201cFossils like this help us learn about ancient ecosystems and give us clues about how the world has changed over time.\u201d\n\nA backyard in Orange County, New York, became the site of an incredible discovery of a complete mastodon jaw -- the first find like it in New York in more than 11 years. New York State Museum\n\nOrange County has been a great place to find mastodon fossils. In fact, about one-third of the 150 mastodon fossils found in New York have come from this area.\n\nDr. Cory Harris from SUNY Orange said they hope to keep digging in the area to see if there are more bones waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cThe jaw is the most exciting part, but the toe and rib fragments might also help us learn more about this animal,\u201d Dr. Harris explained.\n\nThe jaw will eventually be displayed at the New York State Museum in 2025, after scientists finish their research, according to Michael Mastroianni, a leader at the museum."

Day and company ended up working on the Coinbase core exchange, but decided to leave after about four years.\n\n\u201cWe always had the itch to get back into the real Web3 development space, so we decided to get the band back together,\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "Rohan Doctor was a managing director at Goldman Sachs when he founded Louisa AI.\n\nThe startup uses AI to feed deal ideas and networking prompts to bankers and investors.\n\nHere's why he wants to bring the dealmaking playbook to startups.\n\nCold call after cold call, Rohan Doctor wasn't getting as far as he would've hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs managing director had emailed a list of digital strategy execs at banks and private equity firms to try to sell them on his startup, Louisa AI. But he only got a handful of replies back.\n\nTwo years since its launch, Louisa AI has secured about a dozen clients, including some of the biggest names in corporate America. They include Goldman Sachs, VC firm Insight Partners, and, more recently, one of the biggest AI chipmakers and a top consulting firm. But he didn't secure those contracts from cold outreach. He used his own startup's technology, which proactively prompts deal ideas based on people's personal and professional connections, to get in through the front door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Doctor wants to bring his dealmaking playbook to other startups ahead of an anticipated M&A boom.\n\n\"If we're able to close more deals through warm relationships this way, then other startups can, too,\" he said.\n\nThe near-term outlook for M&A activity has gotten brighter, with lower interest rates reducing the cost of borrowing. Wall Street execs are optimistic that Trump's return to the White House, and any business-friendly regulations that may come with it, will be a tailwind for dealmaking. Also, companies resetting their valuations could spur more transactions to close as price expectations align between buyers and sellers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Silicon Valley, VCs and founders are hopeful about the anticipated looser environment, which could boost tech building and dealmaking. VCs, which rely on selling startups in M&A deals for many of their returns, have been dampened by the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust stance on M&A.\n\nLouisa AI was built to suggest potential deals based on the data it's exposed to. It ingests information about who and what employees know by plugging into company CRMs, messaging platforms like Slack and Symphony, and email providers. Since spinning out of Goldman Sachs in 2023, Louisa AI has raised $5 million in seed funding. It suggests about $1 billion in deal values per quarter, Doctor said.\n\nIt also highlights mutual connections to establish a warm introduction, which can make all the difference in the multi-billion investment banking industry built on relationships. While running the bank-solutions group at Goldman Sachs, Rohan Doctor used his network to close transactions worth tens of millions of dollars. As a startup founder, it's been a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've tried the cold outreach and just emailing,\" Doctor said, adding that the startup stopped doing that after it didn't yield good results. What has worked for Doctor is realizing he knows someone who knows someone.\n\nLouisa AI scored the chipmaker contract after the AI flagged that one of Doctor's staff used to work for someone who now worked at the chip manufacturer. With the consultancy, one of Louisa AI's investors connected Doctor with the consulting firm they used to work for. He declined to name these firms due to non-disclosure agreements.\n\n\"Everything needs to be warm when it comes to big companies doing big things with other people. It has to rely on trust,\" he said."

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world races towards 2025, Developer examines what lies ahead for software development in the new year.\n\nAmong the most pressing trends for 2025 are AI development simplification, the integration of cross-functional engineering teams, and the evolution of DevSecOps practices. These shifts promise to redefine how companies approach innovation, security, and efficiency in their development pipelines.\n\nAI-powered development simplification\n\nAvthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale, predicts a significant transformation in the tech stack landscape by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe traditional tech stack will continue to collapse,\u201d Sewrathan notes, highlighting advancements driven by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development. This shift is anticipated to empower engineers of all skill levels to create impactful AI applications with ease.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, the traditional tech stack will continue to collapse, fueled by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development,\u201d Sewrathan explains. \u201cCompanies that deliver frictionless, accessible solutions with low barriers to entry will empower engineers to create impactful AI apps, no matter their level of expertise.\u201d\n\nThis democratisation of AI app creation is expected to increase competition within the industry as more developers gain access to advanced capabilities. Consistency and reliability in AI applications are also set to become paramount.\n\n\u201cAs AI apps become central to everyday interactions in 2025, consistency and reliability will take precedence,\u201d Sewrathan observes.\n\nDeveloper role evolution\n\nIndu Keri, General Manager and Head of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud at Nutanix, envisions a new era of software development starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cSoftware development and engineering is already being democratised with tools like Copilot,\u201d Keri says.\n\nBy combining GenAI with low-code solutions, code will be abstracted to the point of irrelevance. AI will generate applications rather than code, enabling developers to step into strategic roles.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day for developers will change drastically,\u201d Keri notes. \u201cNo longer hamstrung by grunt work, developers will step into an up-leveled, strategic role\u2014communicating with decision-makers about how tech can solve business problems.\u201d\n\nThis evolution, Keri argues, complements developers\u2019 best qualities \u2013 creativity and innovation \u2013 and challenges them to grow into leadership roles within their organisations.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, engineers at any level will be able to create an AI app through the widespread availability of APIs and models,\u201d Sewrathan adds. \u201cBut the differentiators will be consistency, usability, and customer impact.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI and DevOps automation\n\nThe hype around agentic AI will reach boiling point in 2025 as organisations bundle specialised agents for different stages of software delivery, including code generation, testing, and quality assurance. This orchestrator-driven approach will drive a more intelligent approach to DevOps automation.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, says: \u201cInstead of having one, basic GenAI assistant, organisations will bundle together specialised agents for the different stages of software delivery\u2014such as code generation, testing, and quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne agent will act as the orchestrator, directing the others and producing more accurate insights into the end-to-end process.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Coutinho of OutSystems highlights that agentic AI will answer many, but not all, business problems: \u201cFor the last few years, businesses have tried to throw GenAI at all of their problems. The result: GenAI is a remarkable solution for many use cases, but not everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn AI tool is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. Just because tech titans are pushing agentic AI right now doesn\u2019t mean you should scrap simpler solutions. Align your AI strategy with your organisation\u2019s needs, rather than the latest shiny object.\u201d\n\nIntegration of cross-functional engineering teams\n\nMoving beyond AI development, the prediction for cross-functional engineering teams is another area of significant change. Reynolds outlines a future where standalone DevOps teams are phased out in favour of more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, organisations will move away from standalone DevOps teams towards more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines,\u201d Reynolds explains.\n\nThis shift towards unified cross-functional teams is expected to eliminate the remaining silos between software delivery teams and accelerate innovation at a whole new level. To support these integrated teams, organisations will increasingly adopt unified platforms providing capabilities across the entire software delivery lifecycle\u2014from CI/CD to chaos engineering and cloud cost management.\n\nIn line with these platform shifts, Reynolds emphasises the importance of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) that enable engineers to self-serve the solutions and data they need.\n\n\u201cTo maximise the value of these platforms,\u201d Reynolds advises,\u201c[organisations] will expose these capabilities through IDPs.\u201d\n\nEvolution of DevSecOps practices\n\nThe software development landscape is also witnessing a significant evolution in DevSecOps practices.\n\nDylan Thomas, Senior Director of Product Engineering at OpenText Cybersecurity, predicts that, by 2025, DevSecOps will evolve beyond the \u201cshift-left\u201d paradigm to embrace a more mature \u201cshift everywhere\u201d approach.\n\nThis shift will require organisations to apply the right tools at the right stages of the DevSecOps cycle, improving efficiency and effectiveness in security practices.\n\n\u201cLightweight analysis in IDEs will help developers catch issues early,\u201d Thomas elaborates. \u201cAutomation integrated into pull requests and CI/CD pipelines will ensure a cohesive \u2018integrate once\u2019 approach for core functions such as SAST, SCA, and increasingly DAST, particularly for API security testing.\u201d\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline the development process while enhancing overall security.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) maturity\n\nOne of the critical components in this evolving landscape is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nGovernment mandates are driving organisations to adopt SBOMs at scale, requiring them not only to generate these documents but also to make them actionable.\n\nWhile producing SBOMs in standard formats is now routine, the real challenge lies in translating raw data into meaningful risk-based insights.\n\nDevSecOps practices will mature, leveraging tools like VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) to add critical context to SBOMs\u2014reducing inefficiencies in vendor-consumer relationships and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s role in managing complex data types\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s extension capabilities are also anticipated to play a significant role in managing complex data types in one place.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, PostgreSQL will solidify its position as the go-to \u2018everything database\u2019\u2014the first to fully integrate AI functionality like embeddings directly within its core ecosystem,\u201d says Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale.\n\n\u201cThis will streamline data workflows, eliminate the need for external processing tools, and enable businesses to manage complex data types in one place.\u201d\n\nAs companies move towards integrated solutions that can handle diverse datasets without relying on standalone or specialised databases, PostgreSQL is leading the charge towards this future state.\n\nDiverse app stores will reshape mobile distribution\n\nThe app store ecosystem is poised for a significant shift as mobile carriers are expected to regain their influence over app distribution.\n\nMatt Tubergen, EVP of Global Strategy & Partnerships at Digital Turbine, said: \u201cThe app store ecosystem is set to shift away from an Apple and Google duopoly to an open landscape as mobile carriers regain the power to connect consumers with apps.\u201d\n\nEmerging regulatory changes are also playing a critical role in leveling the playing field. These include bans that prevent tech giants like Google from incentivising app store preloads, which allow carriers and device manufacturers to preload their own apps on new devices.\n\nThis newfound autonomy positions carriers as pivotal players in alternative app distribution.\n\n\u201cThis renewed autonomy positions carriers as critical players in alternative app distribution, enabling organic growth for alternative app stores,\u201d Tubergen notes.\n\nCarriers are expected to offer developers better revenue opportunities than those provided by Apple and Google, while consumers will benefit from a more diverse selection of apps.\n\nTubergen points out that \u201cthe new, open app store economy will prioritise the needs of developers and users, shifting away from the current model that only serves Apple and Google.\u201d This shift promises a competitive and decentralised landscape where developers gain more control over their revenue streams.\n\nConsumers are expected to enjoy access to a wider variety of apps curated and tailored to their preferences. With third-party app stores gaining influence and major players like Epic Games and Microsoft advocating for inclusivity, the global app distribution model is likely to expand and mirror the thriving alternative stores seen in Asia.\n\nThis evolution promises an inclusive, innovative, and consumer-focused mobile distribution ecosystem.\n\nEmergence of xOps\n\nThe convergence of DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps into a new \u201cxOps\u201d paradigm is expected as more traditional applications adopt AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u2018AI-aware\u2019 Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities,\u201d explains Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai.\n\nIncreasing security challenges\n\nWhile AI-generated code can significantly increase developer efficiency, it also introduces security risks due to increased volume of code that must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors.\n\n\u201cWhile research has shown that generative AI can halve the time it takes developers to complete coding tasks, the increased volume of code being produced must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors,\u201d warns Holt.\n\n\u201cThis will increase security risk and lead to additional toil in the later stages of delivery, wiping out any efficiency gains from AI-generated code.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in supply-chain attacks. This is likely to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAaron Costello, Chief of SaaS Security Research at AppOmni, observes: \u201cThe past few years, we\u2019ve seen a steady uptick in supply-chain attacks on SaaS through compromised third-party applications. As a result, organisations are placing these integrations and their requested access levels under far more scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy research into data exposures has shown that often no initial foothold is needed for threat actors to gain access to the sensitive data they want. The combination of undocumented legacy API endpoints, over-privileged public access, and gaps in vendor logging capabilities will continue to provide a dangerously effective option for threat actors to execute hit-and-run style attacks.\u201d\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nDespite the increasing security challenges, a failure to secure software could have ever more serious repercussions. In light of increasing awareness and demand for reliable software systems, developers must prepare for heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, comments: \u201cIn the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, there will be an increase in regulatory pressure around poor-quality software.\u201d\n\nGlobal regulators are expected to introduce more stringent standards that extend beyond existing frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). This response is driven by a growing sentiment among consumers; a recent survey conducted by Harness found that ~74% of consumers believe there should be regulations holding companies accountable for poor-quality software updates leading to IT outages.\n\nTo navigate these impending regulatory changes, organisations supporting critical infrastructure \u2013 such as banking, healthcare, and energy services \u2013 must proactively enhance their software testing protocols.\n\n\u201cThey will need well-defined response plans to ensure they can recover quickly when the unexpected happens,\u201d Reynolds notes. Implementing modern software delivery practices is crucial, including feature flags and canary deployments, which enable continuous improvement in code quality and more stable release cycles.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, organisations not only bolster software resilience but also enhance trust and brand loyalty among consumers. As regulations evolve to emphasise software reliability akin to cybersecurity standards, being proactive will be key to supporting business growth and staying ahead of regulatory measures. This approach not only mitigates risks but positions companies favorably in a landscape where quality is increasingly synonymous with competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the predictions for 2025 paint a picture of an industry bracing for radical transformation\u2014driven by advancements in AI development, cross-functional engineering teams, and mature DevSecOps practices. These changes promise to accelerate innovation while enhancing security and user experience across industries.\n\nSee also: PostgreSQL becomes developers\u2019 choice for AI and real-time apps\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

            "article_content": "As the year draws to a close, Google has unveiled its new image and video generation models, Imagen 3 and Veo 2, the latter of which could be a serious competitor to OpenAI's Sora.\n\nGoogle claims to have developed the most powerful video generation model of the moment with Veo 2. It promises groundbreaking performances, including a better understanding of real-world physics, the movement of bodies and objects, and the nuances of human expression. According to Google, the model can adapt to a multitude of cinematographic effects (tight or wide shots, low-angle views, front or rear tracking, etc.) to create unprecedented sequences in ultra-high definition (4K) and up to several minutes long. On paper, this is even more impressive than what OpenAI offers with Sora, a tool that is certainly impressive, but which sometimes lacks fluidity and can also have difficulty coordinating certain movements. Moreover, Sora does not allow the creation of sequences longer than 20 seconds in high resolution (1080p). All videos generated by Veo 2 include a SynthID watermark that is invisible on screen, but which identifies the resulting videos as being generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nAlongside this, Google has unveiled Imagen 3, the latest version of its image generator. It guarantees brighter and generally better-composed images, in a wider variety of artistic styles, from photorealism to impressionism, abstract and animated.\n\nFinally, Google has released Whisk, an experimental tool capable of generating new images without prompts, but using other elements, photos or drawings, as sources of inspiration. By combining several visuals, such as a portrait and a landscape, for example, the tool creates new, unique and personalized images.\n\nVeo 2 and Imagen3 are currently reserved for YouTube creators and companies using Google Labs' VideoFX and ImageFX. Whisk is currently available as an experimental tool, also via Google Labs and only in the United States. \u2013 AFP Relaxnews"

            "article_content": "On Thursday the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has announced they will keep interest rates at 4.75%, in yet another blow for Labour.\n\nOn Wednesday official figures released shows inflation rose in November and the consumer prices index increased by 2.6% year-on-year, up from 2.3% the previous month, this is above the BoE\u2019s 2% target.\n\nRob Morgan, Chief Investment Analyst at Charles Stanley said the bank is now \u201cwary of loosening too much too soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially now fiscal policies revealed in the Budget could add fuel to the inflationary fire into the New Year.\n\n\u201cThe additional costs for employers in the form of higher National Insurance and minimum wage rises looks set to reinforce the trend of escalating costs in the services sector.\n\n\u201cAlthough employers might take some of the hit with lower corporate margins, much of the impact could take the form of higher consumer prices.\u201d\n\nLily Megson, Policy Director at My Pension Expert, said: \u201cThe decision to hold the base rate comes as no surprise following consecutive months of rising inflation. So, where does that leave us as the year comes to an end? Undoubtedly, the economic landscape is a lot more predictable than 12 months, but it\u2019s not without challenges. Inflation is proving sticky, and while the base rate is predicted to drop throughout 2025, the Bank of England will not rush these decisions.\n\n\u201cSavers, especially those nearing retirement, will need to look to the year ahead and factor in shifting interest rates as they pursue their financial goals. Taking advantage of higher interest rates in the short-term will likely be on some people\u2019s agenda, while others will be considering longer-term options for building their pension pots. Crucially, however, these are not decisions they should have to make alone.\n\n\u201cConsumers should not be left exposed to changing macroeconomic headwinds. Instead, the government must step up to ensure people are supported in their financial planning by delivering better access to financial support, education, guidance and advice.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, independent financial advice will remain essential for millions of people, but policymakers have a key role to play in encouraging the UK public to engage with their retirement plans, and ultimately empowering people to achieve their financial goals.\u201d\n\nBen Nichols, Managing Director at RAW Capital Partners, said: \u201cNo early Christmas present, but a cut was largely out of the question given the ongoing inflationary concerns. Fortunately, the outlook for further rate cuts in 2025 is far more promising. Governor Bailey recently suggested that the MPC is preparing to implement up to four reductions to the base rate next year.\n\n\u201cGiven that inflation is unlikely to rise as sharply or for as long as it did two years ago, another rate cut could be on the cards as early as February, which would provide the property market with a welcome shot in the arm.\n\n\u201cThat said, higher borrowing costs will naturally weigh on property investors\u2019 minds, even if underlying data relating to buyer demand and transaction levels is positive. Therefore, the onus remains on lenders and brokers to better support borrowers as they wait for the Bank of England to relax the monetary policy environment.\n\n\u201cI expect that flexible financial products, firm commitments, and transparent communication will continue to be vital qualities for lenders to provide in the months ahead as a result.\u201d"

            "article_content": "After a disastrous October and November, Windows 11 24H2 is back with new compatibility problems. Windows Latest has already covered the new version\u2019s problem with Ubisoft games, apps, and other services. PCs with Dirac Audio join this long list of reported Windows 11 issues.\n\nLike most of the previous issues, this Direc Audio problem stems from the cridspapo.dll file, which is incompatible with 24H2. As a result, the PC cannot identify any audio device, be it the inbuilt speakers, external Bluetooth audio devices and more. It is a sound optimisation technology to improve the audio output, but the drivers don\u2019t work with the latest version update.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the manufacturer will release a patch to fix this audio issue. Meanwhile, the PCs with the update cannot use audio, a core feature of a computer. The obvious option is to roll back the update or do a clean install of Windows 11 23H2, on which the drivers work fine.\n\nMicrosoft will start offering the driver update with a system update once the manufacturer releases them. Until then, 23H2 PCs with Dirac Audio won\u2019t get the Windows 11 24H2 update suggestion in the settings app.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ll see a new \u201cUpgrade to Window 11 is on its way to your device. There is nothing that requires your attention at the moment. Once the update is ready for your device, you\u2019ll see it available on this page\u201d message.\n\nIt\u2019ll contain a link to all the safeguard blocks applicable to your 23H2 PC. We like this idea because you can know which apps and services need a manual update for your PC to become eligible for 24H2.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only issue.\n\nAuto HDR struggles on 24H2\n\nAs already reported by Windows Latest, Windows 11 24H2 crashes some games that rely on Auto HDR feature.\n\nThe Dirac Audio is a manufacturer-related issue, but that doesn\u2019t mean Microsoft has all the corners covered.\n\nOne of its gaming-centric features, Auto HDR, doesn\u2019t work in Windows 11 24H2. The overall gameplay appears murky and dull, and some games crash abruptly while the feature is active.\n\nThe obvious solution is not to use Auto HDR at the moment and wait for Microsoft to release a fix. Since Auto HDR can be applied game-wise or globally, you can disable it for some games or turn it off completely. We suggest you do the latter, which is better than rolling back to Windows 11 23H2.\n\nThe update block is effective if you currently use Auto HDR on your Windows 11 23H2 PC.\n\nWait for a month or so until Microsoft irons out all the kinks with the new update."

Throughout several weeks of these sightings, numerous similar reports of UFO activity have gone unexplained by authorities.\n\nCornwallLive reports there have been unexplained lights seen in the night sky in St. Cleer, Porthtowan, and Newquay. The latest UFO encounter was filmed by a dog walker at around 7:18 p.m. last Monday.\n\nAccording to the witness, the UFO hovered in the sky for about 10 minutes before slowly moving south. They were able to capture some video footage of the UFO as they were approaching the Royal Airforce Base in the area.\n\nThe dog walker said they believe the UFO they saw is linked to another recent sighting in Newquay. The sighting in Newquay occurred on the same day, Dec. 9 at around 6:30 p.m.\n\nThat UFO sighting was caught on video by a woman named Monique Lyle, who described what she saw from her balcony as \u201clike something out of a science fiction movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw the object, I was completely taken aback,\u201d she said. \u201cI often stargaze, so I\u2019m familiar with the night sky, and I knew immediately that this wasn\u2019t a star or any usual phenomenon like an aircraft. It was bright, changing colors, and seemed unusually close to town.\u201d\n\nAnother recent UFO sighting in the area by photographer Chris Piper occurred in St. Cleer on Dec. 15. He captured what he described as a \u201cblue or white object\u201d in some video he had taken of the full moon that evening.\n\n\u201cI was photographing the lunar halo and it wasn\u2019t until I showed [the pictures] to my friend that he noticed the blue dot hovering around the moon,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhen I looked back at the motion pictures, it appeared to be moving.\u201d\n\nWhile all of these UFO sightings in and around Cornwall have gone unexplained, as have many of the supposed drone sightings in the United States, one expert believes they could all be a precursor to an alien invasion."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more-modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York / New Jersey / Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still less than 20, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, less than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine-chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deep fakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a new cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C. the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. it\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios\u2019 were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "A recent groundbreaking experiment in which anesthesia was administered to rats has convinced some scientists that tiny structures in the rodents\u2019 brains are responsible for the experience of consciousness. To pull it off, microscopic hollow tube structures called \u201cmicrotubules\u201d perform some advanced physics; the experts believe microtubules perform incredible operations in the quantum realm. Citing the work of earlier researchers, the study infers that the same kinds of quantum operations are likely happening in the human brain.\n\nDuring their rat brain experiments, scientists at Wellesley College in Massachusetts gave the rodents isoflurane, a type of inhaled general anesthetic used to induce and maintain unconsciousness for medical procedures. One group of drugged rats also received microtubule-stabilizing drugs, while the other did not. The researchers discovered that the microtubule-stabilizing molecules kept the rats conscious for longer than the nonstabilized rats, which more quickly lost their \u201crighting reflex,\u201d or the ability to restore normal posture, according to the group\u2019s findings, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal eNeuro in August 2024.\n\nThe Wellesley study is significant because the physical source of consciousness has been a mystery for decades. It\u2019s a major step toward verifying a theory that our brains perform quantum operations, and that this ability generates our consciousness\u2014an idea that\u2019s been gaining traction over the past three decades.\n\nThe notion that quantum physics must be the underlying mechanism for consciousness first emerged in the 1990s, when Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Roger Penrose, PhD, and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, popularized the idea that neural microtubules enable quantum processes in our brain, giving rise to consciousness. Specifically, they postulated in a 1996 paper that consciousness may operate as a quantum wave passing through the brain\u2019s microtubules. This is known as Orch OR theory, referring to the ability of microtubules to perform quantum computations through a mathematical process Penrose calls \u201cobjective reduction.\u201d\n\nIn quantum physics, a particle does not exist in the way classical physics observes it, with a definite physical location. Instead, it exists as a cloud of probabilities. If it comes into contact with its environment, as when a measuring apparatus observes it, then the particle loses its \u201csuperposition\u201d of multiple states. It collapses into a definite, measurable state, the state in which it was observed. Penrose hypothesized that \u201ceach time a quantum-wave function collapses in this way in the brain, it gives rise to a moment of conscious experience.\u201d\n\nIf this quantum theory of consciousness tied to microtubules turns out to be correct, it could revolutionize our understanding of consciousness and even strengthen the trailblazing theory that consciousness, on a quantum level, is capable of being in all places at the same time. In other words, it can exist everywhere simultaneously, suggesting that your own consciousness can hypothetically connect with quantum particles beyond your brain, maybe entangling with consciousness all across the universe.\n\nMany scientists disregard the Orch OR theory because quantum effects have only been produced in the lab under extremely cold conditions. For example, our technology now includes quantum computers, but their operations rely on temperatures near absolute zero (around minus 273 degrees Celsius) to maintain their quantum states. The warm brain falls well outside those limits, at about 32 to 40 degrees Celsius (about 90 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the deepest regions of the brain, according to a 2022 study. Yet scientists have collected a promising set of data over the years indicating that certain quantum-level operations in animals and plants may actually be responsible for life\u2019s functions.\n\nFor example, scientists theorize that plants, which live at temperatures far warmer than absolute zero, probably use quantum processes to efficiently convert light into energy. First, plants transform photons, or light particles, into a form of matter called excitons, transporting them to the plant\u2019s chloroplasts to start photosynthesis. During this journey, the excitons must navigate around other internal plant structures\u2014fast enough to preserve their energy all the way to their destination. Scientists suggest that plants must use the quantum property of superposition in order to try all possible paths simultaneously. That way, excitons can arrive at their destination in the most efficient way possible.\n\nSimilarly, it may make sense for the billions of neurons firing simultaneously in the human brain to work under the \u201caction over a distance\u201d property of quantum entanglement\u2014the potential for two particles that are very far away from each other to be connected. Scientists have observed this phenomenon in atomic particles before. When they studied one particle, another very distant particle changed its properties as well, even though the two were not apparently connected in any way. An August 2024 study in the journal Physics Review E proposes that a fatty material called myelin, which sheathes the brain cell\u2019s axon, provides the ideal environment for this entanglement. Since the brain appears to be capable of performing quantum operations to facilitate our thoughts, some scientists surmise that this process gives rise to our consciousness.\n\nTwo earlier landmark studies also support a quantum perspective on consciousness. Both involved experiments shining light particles into microtubules and observing that the signal did not degrade. In fact, according to these studies, the experiments demonstrated that quantum states in microtubule signaling can and probably do exist.\n\nOne of the studies, an experiment by physicist and oncology professor Jack Tuszy\u0144ski, PhD, used ultraviolet photons to create quantum reactions for up to five nanoseconds. This quantum coherence lasted thousands of times longer than researchers had expected in a microtubule. Similarly, at the University of Central Florida, researchers shined visible light into one end of microtubules and measured how long the microtubules took to emit that light. They observed re-emission of this light over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds\u2014more than enough time for the brain to perform all of its functions.\n\nThis observation provides concrete evidence that neurons are able to work at speeds that allow quantum operations. It brings us another step closer to understanding exactly how our brain\u2014and perhaps our very consciousness\u2014is linked to a quantum universe.\n\nThe mind \u201cas a quantum phenomenon\u201d would \u201cshape our thinking about a wide variety of related questions, such as whether coma patients or nonhuman animals are conscious,\u201d neuroscientist and Wellesley College professor Mike Wiest, PhD, says in a press release about his team\u2019s recent anesthesia study. In addition to the new work helping us understand more about how to treat brain-related health issues, he says \u201cwe will have entered a new era in our understanding of what we are.\u201d"

            "article_content": "By Cina LAWSON\n\nFor too long, African countries have been sidelined from the digital revolution due to limited technical capacity and inadequate infrastructure. Artificial intelligence promises to bridge the digital divide, but realizing its potential requires international support and significant investment in critical infrastructure.\n\nAs the world enters an era shaped by artificial intelligence, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expected to capture just 10% of the economic growth generated by AI technologies. But by forming strategic partnerships and making large-scale infrastructure investments, LMICs can harness these technologies to foster inclusive, sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapidly evolving AI systems have immense potential to revolutionize public-service delivery and alleviate poverty, unlocking economic opportunities for developing economies like Togo. But fully realizing the promise of these new tools requires adequate infrastructure, such as a reliable electricity supply and broadband connectivity. Without these foundations, the world\u2019s most advanced technologies will remain out of reach for communities that could benefit from them the most.\n\nOn November 13-15, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation organized an international AI conference in Lom\u00e9, bringing together government officials, researchers, civil-society leaders, international experts, and students to discuss the potential of emerging technologies to improve public services in the developing world. Togo is a prime example.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched Novissi, one of the world\u2019s first fully digital cash-transfer programs. Initially designed to support low-income urban residents, Novissi rapidly expanded to cover rural areas in Togo\u2019s 200 poorest cantons, enabling more than 920,000 informal-sector workers \u2013 roughly 25% of the country\u2019s adult population \u2013 to enroll.\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form\n\nBy combining machine learning with mobile-phone metadata, satellite imagery, and phone surveys, the Novissi program ultimately identified and supported more than 150,000 households, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can help governments deliver essential services quickly and equitably.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. In recent years, we have leveraged data science and digital technologies to improve our emergency response capabilities and make government services more efficient, cost-effective, and responsive to citizens\u2019 needs.\n\nConsider the agriculture sector, which employs two-thirds of Togo\u2019s population and accounts for 40% of its GDP. Using satellite imagery and machine-learning tools like Mosaiks, Togolese policymakers can forecast crop yields, anticipate poor harvests, and craft targeted agricultural policies. But the real strength of these technologies is their versatility: a single investment enables policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on a wide range of issues, from electrification to deforestation.\n\nBy bolstering local ownership, African governments can drive inclusive growth. In Togo, we are working to build a sustainable ecosystem of local expertise through initiatives like the newly launched Togo Data Lab, a collaboration between the Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation and the Center for Effective Global Action at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe project joins other prominent African institutions working to position Africa at the forefront of digital development, such as the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. In Togo, the Lab will assist the Togolese government in building sustainable data-science capabilities, thereby enabling us to use AI tools like large language models (LLMs) to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Togolese data scientists trained at the Lab will then collaborate with international experts, thereby ensuring that solutions are driven by local talent.\n\nIn its first year, the Togo Data Lab will focus on agriculture, training staff to use Mosaiks to measure crop yields more precisely. But we have much higher ambitions. We see the Lab as a scalable platform capable of addressing major challenges in health, education, and climate policy.\n\nWe imagine a health-care system transformed by data science, with AI tools improving disease surveillance and enabling policymakers to predict outbreaks of preventable illnesses, and classrooms where LLM-assisted tutors handle administrative tasks, freeing teachers to do what they do best: teaching and connecting with students. We have made remarkable progress, but there is much more to be done.\n\nFor too long, African countries have been sidelined from the digital revolution due to limited technical capacity and inadequate infrastructure. That must change, and now is the time to change it. I urge the international community to join this vital effort. By engaging the private sector and making targeted investments, Africa could become a leader in the global digital economy, not just a participant.\n\nInvesting in local capacity not only empowers policymakers in developing countries like Togo to make smarter, data-driven decisions. It also lays the groundwork for a vast global network of problem solvers, ready to harness cutting-edge technologies to tackle the world\u2019s biggest challenges."

As India's infrastructure development accelerates, cement consumption is projected to rise, making the sector a focal point for achieving net-zero emissions, stated an industry official.\n\nVivek Bhatia, Managing Director & CEO of TKIL Industries, stressed the necessity of balancing economic growth with sustainability efforts. He outlined innovations like cement plants running on waste recovery and capturing CO2 emissions as commercial necessities. Bhatia emphasized the importance of integrating technological advancements and resource efficiency.\n\nAt the 7th Cementing India summit, industry leaders echoed the urgency for innovation. Pietro Recchi of MAPEI advocated for clinker replacement, an effective short-term emissions solution, while Yaswant Mishra from Mangalam Cement underscored the need for governmental support for sustainable practices. Technological trends like AI and IoT could drive industry-wide shifts towards smarter, sustainable operations.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"
