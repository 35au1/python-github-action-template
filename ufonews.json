You have the right to know. And if we are spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money? And if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public? Of course, national security is a big issue and if there is technology that could harm us or our allies that are in the hands of our adversaries, we obviously want to stay ahead of that to the best of our abilities.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense, which oversees UAP research, is set to receive a proposed budget of $850 billion in 2025. However, the exact amount spent on UAP research remains unclear, contributing to congressional frustration over the perceived secrecy surrounding the issue. The Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022, is tasked with investigating these phenomena.\n\nA group of bipartisan lawmakers in Congress introduced the UAP Transparency Act, which would require the declassification of all federal documents related to UAPs. The bill mandates that the president instruct federal agencies to release UAP research documents to the public within 270 days and provide Congress with quarterly progress reports. The UAP Transparency Act was referred to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in May, but no further action has been taken.\n\nAARO reviewed 757 new UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024, identifying 21 cases that \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to their \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d Despite these findings, AARO\u2019s report stated there is no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial life is responsible for these sightings.\n\n\u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the intelligence community, do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of AARO.\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Emma Withrow at ewithrow@sbgtv.com or at x.com/emma_withrow.

While many users appreciate the feature\u2019s convenience, many others prefer to turn off AI overviews because AI results need to be double-checked for accuracy, often defeating the purpose of a Google Search. Google understands the need to make it easier to cross-check and verify AI overview results, and it could soon make it easier to do so by listing all the sources and related content that make up the AI overview summary in Gemini results.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhen you search using Gemini in the Google app and receive an AI Overview response, you can check the AI result for its sources. However, doing so involves using the Google \u201cG\u201d icon at the bottom of every answer, which then uses Google Search to find similar content. This is what this process looks like at the moment:\n\nThe latest Google app v15.47.28 beta appears to be testing the addition of links to relevant web pages directly within the text result of AI Overviews in Gemini results. Google had mentioned this change for AI Overviews in August but did not mention it for the Google app. We managed to activate the feature in the Google app, and here\u2019s how it would appear.\n\nThe expand icon at the bottom right (next to the Source and Related Content section) shows a list of all the sources and related content from different websites, as seen in the third screenshot above.\n\nThis is similar in approach to how Google\u2019s AI overviews on the web appear on your mobile device, which is shown below for reference:\n\nAamir Siddiqui / Android Authority\n\nThis UI for additional sourcing is not currently live within the Google app for Android. We don\u2019t know if and when Google will go ahead with the change. However, given how the approach aligns with the mobile-web version of AI overviews, we hope to see it go live on Android very soon.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a \u2018pretty significant\u2019 improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept\u2014a \"fond farewell\" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper\u2014the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.\u201cHave you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,\u201d the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it\u2019s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren\u2019t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors."

The gen AI-ready data we continuously deliver and write to vector databases like MongoDB is essential to enabling our users to counter hallucinations, allowing the LLMs and AI projects that MAAP customers are working on to leverage sensitive, internal data while keeping models and projects up-to-date.\"\n\nCollaborating to make an impact with AI\n\nProviding customers direct support from technical subject matter experts has been integral to MAAP's success. Since the program's inception, the MAAP Center of Excellence team\u2014highly skilled AI experts from MAAP partners and groups across MongoDB\u2014has worked with more than 150 organizations on a range of technical challenges, including model and technology stack evaluation, chunking strategies, advanced retrieval techniques, and the establishment of agentic workflows. Example projects include working on sound diagnostic-based maintenance recommendations for a large manufacturer, and customer service automations for companies across industries.\n\nA recent example of how MAAP enables organizations to build with AI is IndiaDataHub, which is on a mission to build India's largest market data and analytics platform.\n\nSince the company's founding, MongoDB Atlas has been the platform's operational database for some of its key datasets, and earlier this year, IndiaDataHub joined MAAP to access AI expertise, in-depth support, and a full spectrum of technologies to enhance AI functionality within its analytics platform. This includes connecting relevant data in MongoDB with Meta's AI models to perform sentiment analysis on text datasets.\n\n\"Data is the oil that will fuel the growth of the modern Indian economy,\" said Pranoti Deshmukh, Chief Technology Officer at IndiaDataHub. \"Working with MongoDB, the MAAP ecosystem, and Meta's AI tools, we've been able to accelerate our AI strategy to make high-quality, timely data and analytics available to everyone in India who needs it. The professional support and deep AI expertise we've received through the MAAP program have been outstanding.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to see how many enterprises are leveraging our open source AI models to build better solutions for their customers and solve the problems their teams are facing everyday,\" said Ragavan Srinivasan, VP of Product at Meta. \"Leveraging our family of Meta models and the end-to-end technology stack offered by the MongoDB AI Applications Program demonstrates the incredible power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration across the industry.\"\n\nAnother success story is CentralReach , which provides an AI-powered electronic medical record (EMR) platform that is designed to improve outcomes for children and adults diagnosed with autism and related intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\n\nPrior to working with MongoDB and MAAP, CentralReach was looking for an experienced partner to further connect and aggregate its more than 4 billion financial and clinical data points across its suite of solutions.\n\nCentralReach leveraged MongoDB's document model to aggregate the company's diverse forms of information from assessments to clinical data collection, so the company could build rich AI-assisted solutions on top of its database. Meanwhile, MAAP partners helped CentralReach to design and optimize multiple layers of its comprehensive buildout. All of this will enable CentralReach to support initiatives such as value-based outcome measurement, clinical supervision, and care delivery efficacy. With these new data layers in place, providers will be able to make substantial improvements to their clinical delivery to optimize care for all those they serve.\n\n\"As a mission-driven organization, CentralReach is always looking to innovate on behalf of the clinical professionals\u2014and the more than 350,000 autism and IDD learners\u2014that we serve globally,\" said Chris Sullens, CEO of CentralReach. \"So being able to lean on MongoDBs database technology and draw on the collective expertise of the MAAP partner network\u2014in addition to MongoDB's tech expertise and services\u2014to help us improve outcomes for our customers and their clients worldwide has been invaluable.\"\n\nThe expansion of the MongoDB AI Applications Program builds on recent AI-related announcements from MongoDB.\n\nIn October, MongoDB announced vector quantization capabilities in MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. By reducing vector storage and memory requirements while preserving performance, these capabilities empower developers to build AI-enriched applications with more scale\u2014and at a lower cost.\n\nOutside of MAAP, since the start of the year MongoDB has built partnerships with more than 40 leading AI companies, enabling additional flexibility and choice for customers. Recent collaborations include those with Astronomer, Arize AI, Baseten, CloudZero, Modal, and ObjectBox. By working closely with its AI partners on product launches, integrations, and real-world challenges, MongoDB is able to bring a better understanding of AI to joint customers, deliver interoperability for end-to-end workflows, and to give them the resources and confidence they need to move forward with this groundbreaking technology.\n\nTo learn more about building AI-powered apps with MongoDB, please see our library of articles, tutorials, analyst reports, and white papers .

            "article_content": "Have you ever wanted to be a paranormal detective? Not like those History Channel ghost hunters, but an actual supernatural sleuth? Your wish has come true with Enigma of Fear, a charming and mystery-packed pixel art and 3D indie game that\u2019s soaring on Steam following a great debut.\n\nJust days after its release, Enigma of Fear is in the runnings to be one of the best puzzle games of the year and certainly one of the best detective games \u2013 an unfortunately small genre.\n\nYou play as Mia, a young paranormal detective on the trail of her missing father. This inevitably drags her into the Perimeter, an unnatural realm between realms. What makes Enigma of Fear really shine is that you have to investigate clues as a detective would. That means deduction and inspection are your best friends. It sounds simple enough but it\u2019s rare to have puzzles that truly encourage you to think like a detective. You\u2019ll be sifting through documents and taking accounts from other characters to piece together the narrative in Mia\u2019s mental map. Note that the Perimeter is an open-world, non-linear location, so you\u2019ll use your deductions to decide your next steps.\n\nBetween solving the mysteries surrounding the Perimeter and recent disappearances, you\u2019ll be facing off against horrifying creatures and bosses. It\u2019s not a horror game, so to speak, but \u2013 drenched in atmosphere and oozing creative creatures \u2013 it\u2019s a haunting and engrossing location to search and slice your way through.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to ignore Enigma of Fear\u2019s beautiful art design, seamlessly blending pixel art sprites with old-school-style 3D environments. These visuals go a long way in making the Perimeter and the mystery at its heart that much more engrossing.\n\nEnigma of Fear is currently available at a 10% discount, costing just $22.49 / \u00a318.89 on Steam until Thursday, December 5. Currently sitting at 93% \u2018very positive\u2019 reviews, Enigma of Fear is well on its way to reaching the prestigious \u2018overwhelmingly positive\u2019 tag, too.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking to pick up one of the best indie games this year, then you\u2019d be remiss not to grab Enigma of Fear during this introductory offer.

            "article_content": "After losing his seat in parliament in the last general election, the controversial politician is diving into reality TV, but will his opinions be challenged?\n\nAt the start of Meet the Rees-Moggs, a new reality show following former Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and his family, these words appear on the screen: \"Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of the most divisive politicians in Britain. He\u2019s married to Helena, heiress to a reported \u00a345m fortune. They are married with six kids\u2026 How will the family adjust to life after politics?\"\n\nI can\u2019t know for sure, but has this been a question that anyone has asked? Is anyone being kept up at night wondering how the former Conservative MP for North East Somerset and his family will adjust to a life after politics?\n\nIn fact, I don\u2019t think Jacob Rees-Mogg cares that much how Jacob Rees-Mogg will adjust to life after politics. In the third episode, after finding out that he lost his seat to a Labour MP, Jacob says: \"Life goes on. People need to get on with things. I\u2019m no longer an MP, and that\u2019s life.\"\n\nThe first two episodes of his new Discovery+ series follow the Rees-Moggs in the weeks leading up to the election. It\u2019s all pretty light. We see Jacob out campaigning and mentioning his love for the chocolate eclairs at Greggs. We meet the nanny who looks after his kids (she also helped raise Jacob), and the staff who tend to his country mansion who reveal that Rees-Mogg likes having his boxer shorts ironed.\n\nWatch a trailer for Meet the Rees-Moggs\n\nWe see the nickname for the family BBC iPlayer account is \u2018Vote Conservative'. And, as the family tuck into dinner wearing black tie, we witness Rees-Mogg finding out from one of his kids that a \u2018wasteman\u2019 means something different than a \u2018dustman\u2019.\n\nDiscovery+ go out of the way to tell viewers that Rees-Mogg is 'one of the most divisive politicians in the country', but it is hardly mentioned why he gained that reputation in the first place.\n\nHis hardline views against abortion, including on all counts of rape and incest, are only shown in a brief news clip. His endorsement of the controversial Rwandan refugee policy is talked about briefly. His consistent voting record against same sex rights, including against same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland in 2019, is not mentioned at all.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a chance that he will be thoroughly challenged in the last episode (the first two episodes were available to press, and I watched two more episodes on the day of release), but I honestly wonder how many viewers will make it there if he is.\n\nHelena Rees-Mogg and Jacob Rees-Mogg attend premiere screening of Meet the Rees-Moggs. (Getty Images for Discovery+)\n\nFor you see, Meet the Rees-Moggs is completely and utterly, indescribably boring. The plot for the first two episodes is whether Jacob Rees-Mogg will keep his seat in the general election, but considering the whole hook of the show from the outside \"how will the family adjust to life after politics?\", it hardly keeps you riveted.\n\nLater, we are teased that the family will be attending Boris Johnson\u2019s 60th birthday party, only for the show\u2019s camera crew are not invited to the event, so instead we\u2019re stuck at the house where we witness a member of his staff changing his bedding.\n\nRead more: Jacob Rees-Mogg\n\nThis is impeccable reality TV \u2013 but should the ex-MP be allowed on our screens?

Is it for us peasants to feel trolled as we gawp at his very expensive house? Is it so we gain pity for his staff who drive him about and look after his Bentley? Is it for the GB News viewers who enjoy his political commentary and want to have more content about the man?\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg recording his GB News show State of The Nation in 2023. (PA)\n\nThese five episodes are on Discovery+, a streaming platform that went all out on Olympics programming earlier this year, but whose shows are a random mix of crime, weight loss, and paranormal shows (so many paranormal shows, in fact, that there\u2019s a whole tab of them on their home screen). It feels so random that the show is on here, that I wonder whether Discovery+ knows why it is there for itself.\n\nPoliticians on entertainment shows are nothing new, with Tory MP Penny Mourdant belly flopping on the Tom Daley diving show Splash 10 years ago and Christine and Neil Hamilton famously being the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary.\n\nMatt Hancock and Nigel Farage appeared on I'm A Celebrity (ITV)\n\nThe concerning thing about Meet the Rees-Moggs however, is that it continues a trend, which started on I\u2019m a Celebrity, where current and former politicians with divisive political views (Reform leader Nigel Farage) or questionable political discussions (former Conservative health secretary Matt Hancock) are given a free ticket into entertainment.\n\nWith an absence of political journalists on I\u2019m A Celeb, we were reliant on other celebrities to ask the tough questions and do the accountability for us, without these celebrities knowing that they were going to be on the programme beforehand (although, to be fair, First Dates host Fred Siriex and ITV newsreader Charlene White did a good job with Farage and Hancock respectively).\n\nOn Meet the Rees-Moggs, except for an odd cameo of a political foe, or a journalist mentioning how controversial Rees-Moggs' opinions can be, or the odd heckler on the street swearing that Rees-Mogg responds with a cheery thank you, there\u2019s hardly anything.\n\nIt is as if his divisiveness has just given him a free pass.\n\nMeet The Rees-Moggs is streaming on Discovery+."

            "article_content": "It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nVan Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.\n\nNone has ever been seen alive at sea.\n\nThe list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.\n\nResearchers studying the 16-foot-long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin are hoping to find that out this week.\n\n\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d\n\nOnly six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.\n\nNew Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.\n\nGet a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area\u2019s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.\n\nDNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.\n\nOn Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.\n\nThe dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.\n\nMembers of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.\n\n\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d\n\nThe iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.\n\n\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nIt\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.\n\nThe assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.\n\n\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery in the field of paleoanthropology has shed light on a new human species called Homo juluensis, with distinctively large skulls. Dubbed \"Large Head People,\" this enigmatic group once lived alongside Homo sapiens in eastern Asia. According to Science Alert, fossilised remains unearthed from sediment layers dated over 200,000 years ago revealed individuals with disproportionately large cranial volumes. Initial measurements indicate that their braincases were up to 30% larger than those of Homo sapiens.\n\nHomo juluensis lived approximately 300,000 years ago in eastern Asia, hunted wild horses in small groups, and made stone tools and possibly processed animal hides for survival before disappearing around 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"Collectively, these fossils represent a new form of large-brained hominin,\" Paleoanthropologist Xiujie Wu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and anthropologist Christopher Bae from the University of Hawai'i wrote in the journal PaleoAnthropology earlier this year.\n\nThe unique combination of characteristics exhibited by the Large Head People suggests a complex ancestry, resulting from interbreeding between different hominin groups that coexisted in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago, the researchers said.\n\n\"Although we started this project several years ago, we did not expect to be able to propose a new hominin (human ancestor) species and then to be able to organize the hominin fossils from Asia into different groups,\" said Christopher Bae.\n\nFossils attributed to H. juluensis, primarily consisting of facial and jaw remains, exhibit dental characteristics reminiscent of Neanderthals. However, certain distinctive traits are unlike those found in any other known hominin species, including the Denisovans, setting H. juluensis apart from its ancient human relatives.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear that [in] the eastern Asian hominin fossils\u2026 a greater degree of morphological variation is present than originally assumed or anticipated,\" wrote Wu and Bae.\n\nThe emergence of the 'Large Head People' raises fundamental questions about human evolution, diversity, and migration patterns. Some scientists speculate that this group might have played a significant role in shaping the genetic landscape of modern humans.\n\n"

Close Read more\n\nA breakthrough brain circuit discovery may lead to new treatments for anxiety and stress disorders, and potentially a pill providing the benefits of yoga.\n\nResearchers from the Salk Institute in the US have discovered the pathway behind voluntary breathing and emotional regulation in mice brains.\n\nTheir study, published recently in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveals connections between the brain\u2019s more complex regions and the breathing centre of the primitive brainstem which enables breathing coordination with emotional state.\n\nWhile breathing is mainly automatic, human beings and some animals can self-soothe by slowing breathing, an approach that\u2019s a central part of practices like mindfulness and yoga.\n\nHow exactly the brain regulates breathing and how this impacts anxiety and one\u2019s emotional state is little understood. Scientists say only subconscious breathing mechanisms in the brainstem have been thoroughly understood so far.\n\nNeurons in mouse brain behind breathing regulation ( Salk Institute )\n\nIn the new study, researchers set out to find conscious top-down mechanisms connecting emotional regulation and breathing.\n\nThey first assessed a brain connectivity database to probe connections between different brain areas. The analysis revealed a potential breathing circuit connecting a frontal region, called the anterior cingulate cortex, to an intermediate brainstem area, which then connected to the medulla just below.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the medulla, when active, initiates breathing but signals coming down from a brainstem region are known to inhibit this activity and slow down breathing.\n\nResearchers hypothesised that certain emotions or behaviours could lead to the activation of the brainstem region, which in turn could lower activity in the medulla and slower breath.\n\nHow Breathing Exercises Can Reduce Anxiety\n\nTo test the theory, they recorded brain activity in mice when their breathing was altered during activities like sniffing, swimming, and drinking as well as during conditions inducing fear and anxiety.\n\nResearchers found that when the connection between the cortex and the brainstem region was activated, mice were calmer and breathed more slowly.\n\nThis communication decreased when they were in anxiety-inducing situations, and breathing rates went up.\n\nBy following this pathway, researchers discovered a group of neurons in the frontal cortex of the mice brain that connects to the brainstem and governs essential functions like breathing.\n\n8 Foods That Help With Anxiety According To Experts\n\nThis connection, researchers say, enables mice to coordinate their breathing with their current behaviour and emotional state.\n\nFurther analysis of the connection revealed a new set of brain cells and molecules which scientists believe can be targeted with drugs.\n\nResearchers say the findings may lead to long-term solutions for people with anxiety, stress, and panic disorders.\n\n\u201cOur findings got me thinking: could we develop drugs to activate these neurons and manually slow our breathing or prevent hyperventilation in panic disorder?\u201d study co-author Jinho Jhang said.\n\n\u201cI want to use these findings to design a yoga pill. It may sound silly, and the translation of our work into a marketable drug will take years, but we now have a potentially targetable brain circuit for creating therapeutics that could instantly slow breathing and initiate a peaceful, meditative state,\u201d Sung Han, another author of the study, said."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Mac security provider Moonlock, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u2019\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"
