            "article_content": "INSTITUTE, W.Va. \u2013\u2013 Local volunteers will donate their time over the next dozen weeks to gather food for local food banks in Kanawha and Putnam Counties. The 44th annual United Food Operation food drive kicked off Friday. It\u2019s a 12 week effort to collect as much non-perishable food as possible to be passed along to the region\u2019s needy.\n\n\u201cWe do our pre-planning and get everything together and as we\u2019re talking to the pantries, they\u2019re running out of food. The need is so great we\u2019ve got to keep this going,\u201d said Elaine Harris, UFO Chairperson.\n\nEach Friday through April, the organization will accept donations of food at their warehouse in Institute to be distributed to a dozen food banks across two counties.\n\n\u201cOur warehouse is right off the Institute exit, there will be a big sign. We can take food and store it there and then distribute to the food banks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis year the American Postal Workers Union Local 133 has joined the effort. The union members are employed at the U.S. Postal Service Processing Center at Southridge. The facility had originally been slated for closure, but thanks to efforts by the community and West Virginia\u2019s Congressional delegation it was saved and will stay in place. Harris said the organization wanted to get involved in the food drive out of gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of giving back to the community because the community was so very involved and supportive of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur members are very excited to take part in this,\u201d Tim Holstein, Vice President of APWU Local 133, said in a news release. \u201cWe have a table set up in front of the union office at the plant and at the Main Post Office and are asking everyone to bring canned/nonperishable food to donate. One can of food could make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe effort accepts any non-perishable goods. They\u2019ll take them at the warehouse each Friday or they can also make arrangements to pick up large donations. Harris said it\u2019s a never ending labor of love.\n\n\u201cThe need is so great. This is working people falling through the cracks. This is how we started this program almost 45 years ago,\u201d she said."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d. Lenticular clouds were visible on Thursday and Friday mornings in North-east England.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "Character AI, a startup that lets users chat with different AI-powered characters, is now testing games on its desktop and mobile web apps to increase engagement on its platform.\n\nThe games are available to Character AI\u2019s paid subscribers and a limited set of users on the free plan. For this initial release, the company developed two games, Speakeasy and War of Words.\n\nUsers who have access to the games can go to any of the characters they are chatting with in the browser and tap on the new controller icon. Users can then play the games with the existing characters. The app shows a pop-up to users to start a new chat for games so their previous conversation with that character stays the same.\n\nIn Speakeasy, users have to get the chatbot to say a particular word without using five listed words. For instance, if you have to make the bot say \u201ccroissant\u201d without using listed words like pastry, butter, bake, French, and flaky.\n\nImage Credits: Character AI\n\nIn War of Words, users have to duel with the character, and an AI referee decides who won a particular round over five rounds.\n\nCharacter AI said that this is the company\u2019s way of making the service more entertaining.\n\n\u201cOur goal as an AI entertainment company is to find ways to make the Character.AI experience even more fun and entertaining. We\u2019re currently testing a feature that allows gameplay with your favorite Characters, all while keeping the immersive experience users love,\u201d a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nUsers already have their own characters for text-based games like this Space Adventure Game. However, the company is trying to bring its own games to the platform, too.\n\nCharacter AI has gone through personnel changes at the top after co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas left for Google. The company hired a YouTube exec as the chief product officer, and Dominic Perella, who was the general counsel to the company, became the interim CEO.\n\nIn December, Perella told TechCrunch that Character AI positions itself as an entertainment company. The introduction of games is a step that further reinforces that image.\n\n\u201cWhile there are companies in the space that are focused on connecting people to AI companions, that\u2019s not what we are going for at Character AI. What we want to do is really create a much more wholesome entertainment platform. And so, as we grow and as we sort of push toward that goal of having people creating stories, sharing stories on our platform, we need to evolve our safety practices to be first class,\u201d he said.\n\nPlatforms like YouTube, LinkedIn, and Netflix have used games to increase engagement on their platforms. Character AI is possibly taking the same route to have users spend more time on the platform. According to analytics firm Sensor Tower, Character AI users spend 98 minutes per day on the app.\n\nLast year, the company added new safety tools for teens, including more prominent labels on AI characters notifying users that these are not real people after the company was part of multiple lawsuits. The startup also added a time-out notification for when a user is on the app for 60 minutes at a time."

            "source": "The Verge",
            "article_content": "Microsoft made a trio of announcements this week that are going to be very important for how the company approaches its big AI bet in 2025. It started off by creating a new AI engineering group to focus its developers on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. Microsoft then announced pay-as-you-go agents for its relaunched Copilot Chat for businesses, and it finished the week by bundling Office AI features into Microsoft 365 for consumers and raising the subscription price.\n\nAll three of these announcements are linked to Microsoft\u2019s insatiable hunger to win at AI. The company still prioritizes security through employee performance reviews, but it increasingly feels like promoting AI is an equally high priority.\n\nThe new engineering group is a good example of Microsoft\u2019s priorities. Led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, the new CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools division will combine Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div and AI platform teams together. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the reorganization as \u201centering the next innings of this AI platform shift\u201d and said it will \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d Nadella has regularly said that the pace of AI is changing software development, and now Microsoft is building an AI-first app stack to try and take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nCombining Microsoft\u2019s AI platform work and its developer division will put AI at the heart of the very tools, platforms, and services that Microsoft builds for customers and its own teams. Nadella even described this platform shift as the ability for Microsoft\u2019s AI agents, which are essentially virtual employees that automate tasks, to eventually be able to build custom applications. It\u2019s a transformation for Microsoft that looks like it will flip the company from software-as-a-service to service-as-software \u2014 where once-manual human tasks are automated by software and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has spent the past 15 years selling cloud computing to businesses, tempting them to move off traditional software that\u2019s licensed and installed to on-premise servers toward servers hosted by the software giant. Nadella led Microsoft\u2019s transformation to cloud infrastructure and services before becoming CEO, and it\u2019s been hugely successful for the company. Now, Nadella appears to be betting on being able to automate many people-based services and package this up in a software solution Microsoft can sell to businesses.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to some employees in Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div organization this week, and it\u2019s clear there is some unease about the company\u2019s commitment to AI at all costs. Microsoft\u2019s new AI engineering group emerged just days after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg predicted 2025 is going to be a year where \u201cMeta, and the other companies that are working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.\u201d In an interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg said he believes that, over time, a lot of the code in Meta\u2019s apps \u201cwill be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a scary prospect for the thousands of engineers at Meta and Microsoft who have spent their entire careers learning how to build software. One engineer in Microsoft\u2019s new CoreAI team tells me there\u2019s now a feeling that if you\u2019re not all in on AI, there won\u2019t be a place for you in this new team.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s transition here will undoubtedly see engineering jobs change, and it\u2019s all part of a revenue opportunity for AI that the company is constantly chasing. Investors are increasingly looking for returns on Microsoft\u2019s big bets on AI, and recent reports have suggested that it\u2019s struggling to sell businesses on the idea of paying extra for AI-powered versions of Office apps. That\u2019s probably why this week we also saw Microsoft relaunch Copilot as Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, complete with free ChatGPT-like capabilities and pay-as-you-go agents. It\u2019s a rebranding of what was once Bing Enterprise Chat, then Copilot, and now Copilot Chat.\n\nI spoke to Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer of AI at work, earlier this week, and he made it clear this relaunch is also Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt to get people hooked on using AI at work. \u201cWhat we find is that when you start to use it, you become accustomed to and appreciative of the value that it can provide at work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThe free chat side of Copilot has already been popular for businesses that rely on Microsoft\u2019s software and services, and by adding in agent capabilities, there\u2019s an upsell opportunity to get businesses to pay extra to automate tasks with AI.\n\nMicrosoft can also use this Copilot Chat as a way to tempt businesses into upgrading to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot at $30 per user per month. \u201cWhile Copilot Chat is a powerful new on-ramp for everyone in your organization to build the AI habit, Microsoft 365 Copilot remains our best-in-class personal AI assistant for work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThis is where Copilot really transforms from a simple chatbot into a more assistive technology that can analyze Excel data for you, write paragraphs in Word, or generate an entire PowerPoint presentation. A lot of CTOs tell me that businesses have found the most value from Copilot inside Microsoft Teams, where the AI assistant will transcribe meetings and pull out key talking points to make it easy to catch up on calls you might have missed.\n\nMost businesses aren\u2019t paying the extra for Copilot inside Office apps, though. While adding an AI-powered version of the Python programming language to Excel is powerful and summaries of Outlook emails are super useful, Microsoft needs a lot more compelling Copilot features if it wants businesses to pay that $30 per user per month fee.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar situation over on the consumer side, which is why Microsoft started bundling its AI-powered Office features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions this week. Instead of asking consumers for $20 extra per month for Copilot Pro, Microsoft is raising its subscription prices by $3 per month to bundle Copilot into Office apps.\n\nAs part of this price bump, Microsoft is providing a set of AI credits that can be used on Copilot in apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. You\u2019ll get a monthly allotment of these credits, which can also be used for things like image generation in the Designer app or in apps on Windows like Paint, Photos, and Notepad. If you want unlimited usage of Copilot in Office apps or all of these AI features, you\u2019ll still need to pay for Copilot Pro.\n\nMicrosoft had been testing this Microsoft 365 subscription change in Australia, New Zealand, and some markets in Asia, and it feels like the worldwide launch this week is an even bigger test before the company does something similar for its commercial subscriptions.\n\nGoogle may well force Microsoft\u2019s hand here, after revealing this week that its Gemini Business plan, which you previously had to pay $20 per user per month for, is now free. Google is now bringing all of its AI features to its Workspace app at no extra cost, which piles on the pressure for Microsoft to make some similar moves for commercial customers of Microsoft 365.\n\nAs the competition heats up in 2025, expect to see Microsoft come up with even more inventive pay-as-you-go agents or AI credit methods to get consumers and businesses addicted to AI.\n\nThe pad:\n\nMicrosoft won\u2019t support Office apps on Windows 10 after October 14th. If you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time. Microsoft has started warning that it will no longer support Office apps, known as Microsoft 365 apps, on Windows 10 after October 14th \u2014 the day support ends for the old OS. While the apps will continue to function, there could be issues over time. It\u2019s all part of an effort from Microsoft to get businesses and consumers to upgrade to Windows 11.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time.

Microsoft stops using Bing to trick people into thinking they\u2019re on Google. Microsoft has started quietly killing off its spoofed Google UI that it was using to trick Bing users into thinking they were using Google.

Microsoft\u2019s former Surface design chief joins Amazon. Two key Surface inventors are reuniting at Amazon this week . Ralf Groene , who was previously head of design for Windows and devices, has joined Amazon to be part of Panos Panay \u2019s devices and services team. Panay left Microsoft in 2023, after working alongside Groene to create the original Surface tablet more than 10 years ago. Amazon also hired Xbox cofounder J Allard recently, who is also working on Panay\u2019s devices team.

While the museum itself is fascinating, boasting over 40 rooms of pioneer exhibits and Native American artifacts, the kicker is that it's housed in a nearly century-old hospital. If that wasn't creepy enough already, just wait until you hear the ghost stories that haunt the building to this day.\n\nOpened in 1932, the Alva General Hospital operated for 40 years until a new facility was built on the South side of town. The hospital had a bit of a reputation for botched surgeries, and rumor has it that the restless spirits of the wronged patients still roam the halls in search of vindication. In support of this theory, multiple people have reported seeing mysterious lights and shadows in the building after dark.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf you visit the museum, you'll see several nods to its past life, including a vintage medical equipment display with an embalming table and many other instruments. Only the first floor of the building is open to the public; the other two have long since been boarded up, which adds to the eeriness. There's also a player piano that allegedly sounds at random and a blood spot on the floor that magically reappears each time it's wiped away.\n\nWhether or not you have a paranormal experience at the museum (or even believe in ghosts, for that matter), the building's rich history alone makes it worth visiting. Plus, the rest of the exhibits are heaven for history buffs, with rooms modeled after everything from a historic schoolhouse to an old-fashioned drug store. Educational events such as blacksmithing workshops are held throughout the year, and elementary students come from all over the state to experience a realistic school day in early-1900s, small-town Oklahoma.\n\nVisit the Cherokee Strip Museum website for more information, including current hours of operation and entrance fees. You can also visit the Cherokee Strip Museum's Facebook page to see additional photos.\n\nHave you ever been to the Cherokee Strip Museum? If so, do you think it's one of the most haunted places in Oklahoma? We'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nCan't get enough frightful fun? Check out this hike to an abandoned castle in Oklahoma. It's one of the coolest (and creepiest) trails in the Sooner State \u2014 but decidedly less creepy if you have AllTrails+ in your pocket to keep you on the right track."

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "We\u2019ve been waiting for a big ChatGPT upgrade for months now, but OpenAI has yet to announce one. Sure, the company had a monster month of announcements in December. OpenAI took the o1 reasoning model out of beta, making it available to more ChatGPT users. The text-to-video Sora tool is now available to users in certain markets. The o3 reasoning model has also been announced and is currently undergoing testing.\n\nThese are just a few of the AI announcements OpenAI made in December, but there\u2019s no word on when the GPT-4o upgrade will drop. Unofficially, reports say that ChatGPT GPT-5, or whatever it ends up being called, is running behind schedule, as OpenAI has had issues training the next-gen AI model. OpenAI isn\u2019t the only AI company experiencing such problems.\n\nSam Altman has been hyping OpenAI\u2019s accomplishments recently, teasing potential ChatGPT features to come in 2025 while also talking about the larger goals. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is the next big thing, an AI that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d Altman said in a blog post recently, adding that OpenAI is already starting to look at superintelligence development.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHow close are we to that big AI breakthrough? Some people think the recent excitement that some OpenAI engineers are displaying online suggests that the company is indeed close to some sort of big advancement in AI.\n\nSome AI fans noticed the recent teasers from OpenAI employees, as well as an essay from an AI researcher who goes by the name of \u201cGwern\u201d online.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 AI Researcher Gwern just dropped the latest essay on OpenAI o3, o4, o5\n\n\n\nHere are a few important points from the essay:\n\n\n\n\u2013 openAI may have chosen to keep its \"o1-pro\" model private, using its computational resources to train a more advanced model like \"o3\", similar to the\u2026 https://t.co/p10BXXjuQH pic.twitter.com/Zcu7a1uY7C \u2014 Haider. (@slow_developer) January 16, 2025\n\nGwern theorized that OpenAI may hold the key to developing AGI and superintelligence. A powerful reasoning model like the o1 or o1 pro can produce the data needed to train more advanced reasoning models.\n\nThe essay author in the tweet above also said they\u2019re surprised OpenAI isn\u2019t keeping o1-pro private so they can use it for training o3 and newer models. Eventually, AI models will train themselves, leading to the big AGI and ASI breakthroughs we\u2019re waiting for.\n\nGwern suggests that OpenAI may already be on the verge of a big breakthrough, or they\u2019ve already done it behind closed doors:\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why OAers are suddenly weirdly, almost euphorically, optimistic on Twitter, watching the improvement from the original 4o model to o3 (and wherever it is now!) may be why. It\u2019s like watching the AlphaGo Elo curves: it just keeps going up\u2026 and up\u2026 and up\u2026 There may be a sense that they\u2019ve \u2018broken out\u2019 and have finally crossed the last threshold of criticality, from merely cutting-edge Al work, which everyone else will replicate in a few years, to takeoff \u2013 cracked intelligence to the point of being recursively self-improving and where o4 or o5 will be able to automate AI R&D and finish off the rest.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about OpenAI being close to the next massive improvement in AI but also the future beyond that. Access to superintelligence will make subsequent AI developments easier and more efficient because an AI mind will handle the next innovations.\n\nAlso, in a scenario where OpenAI might be close to AGI and ASI, it would obtain an incredible advantage over competitors. Other AI firms that have not established their own superintelligence will have to develop AI with traditional methods. In contrast, OpenAI would have ASI employing its own discoveries to create better AI, and it\u2019ll do it more efficiently.\n\nThis is all speculation at this point, as OpenAI has yet to make any announcements. But it\u2019s all based on the recent hype from Sam Altman and other OpenAI engineers. Of course, they always seem to go out of their way to hype OpenAI\u2019s efforts on social media, so this all could simply be more of the same.\n\nAlso, if and when ChatGPT AGI and ASI are reached, don\u2019t expect it to be affordable or even available publicly. At least, not initially. OpenAI rivals might be just as close to AGI and ASI, but they might be more restrained in teasing imminent breakthroughs.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also the safety aspect to consider. Artificial intelligence, from the current ChatGPT models to AGI and ASI, will have to be aligned with humanity\u2019s interests so it doesn\u2019t develop its own agenda, which could almost certainly endanger our species.\n\nBack to GPT-5, it\u2019ll still be interesting to see what OpenAI does next in terms of ChatGPT upgrades. More news about o3 should come soon. Then, GPT-4o will celebrate its first anniversary this summer. Some sort of upgrade for the base ChatGPT model is surely due soon."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

            "article_content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have historically focused their virtual health care enforcement efforts on \u201ctraditional\u201d telemarketing, broker, runner, and related schemes. These arrangements generally involve sales agents, recruiters, or marketers who direct patients to purported telemedicine companies, which then enter into payment arrangements with physicians and/or non-physician practitioners for the provision of medically unnecessary health care services. The practitioners often have limited or no interaction with the supposed patients, do not review or have access to patient medical records, and order or prescribe medically unnecessary items or services from a predetermined list.\n\nIn July 2022, the OIG formalized its concerns regarding such arrangements in a Special Fraud Alert. As noted by the OIG, these schemes implicate multiple civil and criminal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the civil False Claims Act (FCA), and criminal fraud statutes. The OIG further stated that these arrangements have the potential for considerable harm to both federal health care programs and program beneficiaries, including (1) inappropriate increases in costs for medically unnecessary items and services, (2) patient harm or delayed clinical services, and (3) corruption of medical decision-making.\n\nWhile DOJ and the OIG have continued to pursue and investigate telefraud schemes, two cases announced in 2024 demonstrate a shift in telemedicine enforcement from \u201ctraditional\u201d schemes to more sophisticated investigations and potential criminal exposure in certain matters.\n\nFirst, in June 2024, Ruthie He, the founder, CEO, and clinical president of Done Global (Done), and David Brody, clinical president of Done and the sole physician shareholder of Done Health, P.C., were indicted, arrested, and arraigned in a first-of-its-kind telemedicine criminal prosecution (see our prior post here). Both He and Brody face a seven-count indictment alleging conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges that He and Brody orchestrated a scheme to generate over $100 million in revenue by inappropriately offering Adderall and other stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Among other allegations, the defendants purportedly violated the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine and directed practitioners to prescribe and renew Adderall prescriptions without clinical justification. The practitioners were allegedly paid based upon an above-market pay structure tied to the number of patients ultimately receiving prescriptions. Indeed, the indictment asserts that prescribing practitioners often were not licensed in the states where prescriptions were issued and that Adderall and other stimulants were ordered in violation of state physician supervision requirements.\n\nThe prosecution of He and Brody is proceeding in federal court in the Northern District of California before Judge Breyer. In October 2024, He\u2019s bond was revoked, and she was remanded to custody as a flight risk. On December 2, 2024, He filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, moved to compel disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion asserts that the indictment fails to satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Controlled Substances Act, that the health care fraud conspiracy elements have not been adequately alleged, and, in the alternative, that He should be entitled to grand jury materials. On December 16, 2024, DOJ opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing the sufficiency of the indictment and contesting the disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion to dismiss is currently pending.\n\nIn addition to He and Brody, several other Done personnel have cases pending in the Northern District of California. Two Done nurse practitioners and an executive leader have cases pending before Judge Breyer. In the last related case, a Done physician has entered a plea agreement.\n\nSecond, also in June 2024, a behavioral health telemedicine holding company and its practice affiliates (collectively, Supportive Care) agreed to pay approximately $4.6 million to resolve allegations related to the submission of false claims to Medicare and the Connecticut Medicaid program. Interestingly, DOJ alleged that the telemedicine company submitted false claims for \u201ctelehealth originating site facility fees.\u201d Under the applicable Medicare billing code, telehealth originating site fees are only billable when the originating site (in this case the nursing facility) provides administrative and clinical support for the telehealth patient. Instead, here, the telemedicine company and its affiliates billed for the originating site facility code.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ alleged that Supportive Care submitted false claims for psychological services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. DOJ alleged, however, that the beneficiaries were not in fact residing in the nursing facilities and had been transferred to various hospitals and admitted as inpatients. The settlement resolved both sets of FCA allegations.\n\nThese two cases demonstrate that DOJ and the OIG are expanding their investigation and enforcement activities beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d telefraud arrangements into more complex areas. In the Done prosecution, DOJ is seeking to criminally enforce allegedly fraudulent telehealth activity implicating compliance with state corporate practice and physician supervision requirements. In the Supportive Care resolution, DOJ and the OIG focused on the alleged failure to adhere to telehealth-specific codes. Both matters portend a trend likely to continue in 2025 whereby a maturing telehealth industry is subject to more sophisticated government investigations.\n\n[View source.]"

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

Only the super-wealthy would have been able to afford their own personal spa\n\nPompeii, a third of which is still buried, had a population of around 30,000 people.\n\nDuring its prime, the city was home to thriving industry, alongside financial and political networks.\n\nThe wealth of some inhabitants is clear from the bathhouse, which includes a changing room with a mosaic floor decorated with geometric patterns filled with marble from across the Roman Empire.\n\nThe spa-like complex begins with a hot room rather like a sauna, which had a suspended floor allowing hot air to flow underneath.\n\nNext comes a colourful warm room, where it is likely bathers would have oil rubbed into their skin, then removed with a curved instrument called a strigil.\n\nThe last stage is the frigidarium, or cold room, where an opulent plunge pool large enough for 30 people was surrounded by red columns and frescoes depicting athletes.\n\nArchaeologists, who were followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, have uncovered an entire block of Pompeii, including a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house containing the bathhouse and a huge and sumptuous banqueting room discovered last year.\n\nThe block may all have been owned by Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.\n\nThe spa-like complex begins with a hot room rather like a sauna, which had a suspended floor allowing hot air to flow underneath\n\nNext comes a colourful warm room, where it is likely bathers would have oil rubbed into their skin, then removed with a curved instrument called a strigil\n\nThe last stage is the frigidarium, or cold room, where an opulent plunge pool large enough for 30 people was surrounded by red columns and frescoes depicting athletes\n\nPompeii, a third of which is still buried, had a population of around 30,000 people. During its prime, the city was home to thriving industry, alongside financial and political networks\n\nDr Zuchtriegel said: 'There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy.\n\n'And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.'\n\nNext door to a small prayer room in the house, in a cramped space, has been found the remains of a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early twenties.\n\nDr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii, said: 'The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death.\n\n'The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.'\n\nDr Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also reveals a darker side of Roman life.\n\nJust behind the hot room is a boiler room, with a furnace sitting beneath, which slaves would have had to operate amid unbearable heat.\n\nThe excavation is in its final weeks and eventually the site will be opened to the public.\n\nThe wealth of some inhabitants is clear from the bathhouse, which includes a changing room with a mosaic floor decorated with geometric patterns filled with marble from across the Roman Empire\n\nJust behind the hot room is a boiler room, with a furnace sitting beneath, which slaves would have had to operate amid unbearable heat\n\nMeanwhile a study of an Alexander the Great mosaic described by experts as the most important mosaic of the Roman age, which was discovered in Pompeii in 1831, suggests the rocks used to make it could have come from across Europe\n\nMeanwhile a study of an Alexander the Great mosaic described by experts as the most important mosaic of the Roman age, which was discovered in Pompeii in 1831, suggests the rocks used to make it could have come from across Europe.\n\nThe mosaic, containing around two million pieces, may have used rocks from several Mediterranean mining areas.\n\nThis includes Greece, Tunisia and the Iberian Peninsula, the study led by the University of Naples Federico II suggests.\n\nIt is published in the journal PLOS One."

            "article_content": "Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors.\n\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive thinks his company has the best artificial-intelligence technology on the market. Now he has to get consumers to care.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors and he wants the chatbot built on it to be used by 500 million people by the end of 2025, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t said how many people currently use Gemini, but market leader ChatGPT has about 300 million weekly users. The Gemini app was the 54th most downloaded free app on iPhones Wednesday. ChatGPT was No. 4.\n\nGoogle was caught flat-footed by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite being one of the pioneers of AI and spending years working on similar chatbots. The company has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nGemini isn\u2019t yet a serious moneymaker, but it is central to Google\u2019s push to stay on the cutting edge of AI, a technology already starting to reshape the company\u2019s core search and ads businesses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s newest AI technology jumped ahead of ChatGPT maker OpenAI\u2019s technology last month on the Chatbot Arena rankings closely watched by people in Silicon Valley. OpenAI dominated the rankings for much of the past year.\n\nGoogle launched the Gemini chatbot, formerly Bard, a few months after ChatGPT and has updated it with dozens of new features in an effort to gain ground. OpenAI, meanwhile, began directly targeting Google last summer when it added a web-search function to ChatGPT.\n\nThe ChatGPT mobile app has been downloaded about 465 million times on Android and iOS devices, compared with 106 million for Gemini, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nMost of those downloads came on Android phones. Until recently, Gemini was part of Google\u2019s search app on Apple devices. A separate Gemini app for iOS made its debut in November. Google said it was downloaded more than 10 million times through the end of the year.\n\nUsage of AI features built into other applications, such as Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, aren\u2019t captured by publicly available measures.\n\nUntil recently, the Gemini chatbot team reported to the executive in charge of search and ads, but a recent reorganization moved it to the Google DeepMind division that does advanced research.\n\nPichai said at the time that the move would \u201cenable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app.\"\n\nGrowth in search advertising has slowed in recent years, and Google has increasingly looked to new business lines including subscriptions. It offers a premium version of Gemini with more features for $20 a month, similar to other chatbots.\n\nBut unlike its competitors, Google packages its Gemini subscription with perks including AI features in apps like Gmail and two terabytes of file storage.\n\nSifei Han, a data scientist living in Philadelphia, upgraded to the Gemini premium plan last year after being offered a two-month free trial. He said he mainly uses it for the extra storage, not the AI features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with ChatGPT\u2019s style,\" said Han, who also pays for ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAbout 60% of Gemini\u2019s paying users kept their subscriptions six months after first signing up, according to an Earnest Analytics analysis of debit- and credit-card data from millions of anonymous consumers. That was better than some competitors such as Character.AI and Perplexity, but lagged behind OpenAI and Anthropic, which makes the chatbot Claude.\n\nSubscriptions to Gemini were a fraction of the $10.7 billion in revenue Google parent Alphabet made from subscriptions, device sales and purchases in its mobile app store in the three months ended September. Google\u2019s core advertising business brought in $65.9 billion during the same period. The company hasn\u2019t introduced ads in Gemini.\n\nGemini has been a source of controversy in the past. Google apologized to users and rolled back an image-generation feature last year after the chatbot produced images of Black soldiers in Nazi garb and sometimes refused to generate depictions of white people. It restored the feature six months later.\n\nIn addition to the chatbot, Gemini is powering features that perform complex tasks for users, like preparing research reports and generating podcasts based on a set of documents.\n\nGoogle sells the technology that powers Gemini to developers, uses it for the \u201cAI overviews\" that sometimes appear at the top of search results and recently began packaging it with the business versions of Gmail and Google Drive. Pichai has said all of Google\u2019s products with more than two billion users now have features powered by Gemini.\n\nThe company has also tried to convince device manufacturers to make Gemini the default assistant on mobile phones, which it already does on its own Pixel phones. Motorola and OnePlus, which both use Google\u2019s Android mobile software, made Gemini the default on some of their phones last year.\n\nWrite to Miles Kruppa at"

            "article_content": "The retail industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, thanks to the transformative power of machine learning. A recent article by Akhilesh Kota sheds light on how machine learning is revolutionizing the dynamic pricing landscape, enabling retailers to make more informed and adaptive decisions. The insights delve into the nuances of this innovative approach, emphasizing its role in reshaping consumer experiences and business profitability.\n\nUnderstanding Dynamic Pricing\n\nDynamic pricing is a strategy that adjusts prices in real-time, responding to fluctuations in demand, competition, and external factors. Unlike traditional static pricing, it uses advanced algorithms to analyze and react to market conditions with accuracy and speed. When combined with machine learning, dynamic pricing becomes even more powerful. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and refine pricing strategies based on actionable insights. This enables businesses to stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and maximize revenue. By ensuring prices are neither excessively high nor unsustainably low, dynamic pricing balances profitability with customer satisfaction, driving sustainable business growth.\n\nMachine Learning: The Game Changer\n\nThe application of machine learning in dynamic pricing brings unprecedented sophistication to pricing strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Machine learning algorithms excel in several key areas:\n\nAnalyzing Market Trends: These systems detect subtle shifts in consumer preferences, competitor pricing, and market conditions, enabling proactive and informed pricing adjustments.\n\nPredicting Demand: By forecasting demand patterns for specific products and timeframes, businesses can optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Personalization: Tailored pricing strategies based on individual customer profiles, preferences, and purchase history create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.\n\nBy automating complex analytical processes, machine learning not only reduces human error but also enables faster, more accurate responses to dynamic market conditions, empowering businesses to stay competitive.\n\nData as the Backbone\n\nThe success of machine learning in dynamic pricing hinges on the quality and diversity of data inputs. Retailers need to collect extensive information, such as historical sales trends, customer demographics, competitor pricing, and broader economic indicators. These datasets are essential for training algorithms that evolve and optimize pricing strategies over time. Furthermore, integrating real-time data allows these models to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions, ensuring prices remain competitive and aligned with current demand. This combination of comprehensive data and real-time updates empowers businesses to make informed, agile decisions, helping them gain an edge in today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive markets.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nThe potential of machine learning in dynamic pricing is vast, but it comes with challenges that businesses must navigate carefully. Ethical concerns, such as unintentional price discrimination, can erode consumer trust if not addressed transparently. Moreover, the implementation of machine learning systems demands substantial investment in infrastructure, skilled professionals, and technical expertise. These hurdles can be daunting, particularly for smaller organizations. To overcome them, businesses should prioritize transparency in pricing strategies and ensure algorithms adhere to ethical standards. Investing in scalable, user-friendly technologies and fostering a workforce skilled in data science can simplify adoption, ensuring the benefits outweigh the challenges.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe integration of machine learning into dynamic pricing represents a transformative shift toward a smarter and more adaptive retail landscape. As technology continues to advance, several key developments are expected to shape the future of pricing strategies:\n\nImproved Algorithms: Enhanced models will delve deeper into consumer behavior, identifying subtle trends and preferences for precise price adjustments.\n\nSeamless Integration: Dynamic pricing systems will increasingly connect with inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement tools, creating unified ecosystems.\n\nGlobal Applications: Machine learning will enable region-specific pricing strategies, catering to the unique demands of diverse markets and cultural contexts.\n\nThese advancements will not only empower retailers with better decision-making tools but also foster customer satisfaction by ensuring transparent, fair, and competitive pricing tailored to individual needs.\n\nIn conclusion, Akhilesh Kota\u2019s insights into machine learning-powered dynamic pricing reveal its immense potential to transform retail. Leveraging data and advanced algorithms enables businesses to enhance efficiency, boost profitability, and adapt to evolving market demands. Embracing these innovations will be essential for retailers aiming to thrive in a competitive and rapidly changing industry landscape."

            "article_content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 After more than a year of painstaking negotiations, Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip that, if implemented, could see nearly three dozen Israeli hostages reunited with their families and give hungry and displaced Palestinians a reprieve from months of violence.\n\nIsrael\u2019s government still needs to formally approve the deal, in a vote officials say will take place Thursday morning. But the agreement could mark a first step toward ending a 15-month war that has destroyed Gaza and divided Israelis.\n\nThe truce, mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, would begin on Sunday and cover an initial period of 42 days.\n\nPalestinians in Khan Younis celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. (Video: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is one of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d President Joe Biden said Wednesday in remarks from the White House. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply satisfied this day has come \u2026 for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nplay Play now NaN min Follow on Podcast episode Spotify Apple Google Amazon\n\nUnder the first six-week phase of what mediators hope will evolve into a three-stage process for peace, 33 of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2014 mainly women, children, the elderly and wounded \u2014 will be released from Hamas captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli detention, in a carefully choreographed sequence that will involve humanitarian groups and coordination between Hamas, Egypt and Israel.\n\nAmong the 33 captives slated for release are Americans Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nDekel-Chen was wounded in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Siegel, 65, will be freed because of his age. A third U.S. citizen, Edan Alexander, was abducted near Gaza while serving in the Israeli military and won\u2019t be released until the second phase of the ceasefire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas agreed to release five female Israeli soldiers in the first phase. The remains of at least four more Americans are also still in Gaza. \u201cWe are committed to getting the remains out,\u201d the official said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Jan. 15, following more than 15 months of devastating war. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)\n\nIsrael will withdraw troops from some parts of Gaza and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into the enclave, where 90 percent of the population, or 1.9 million people, are displaced in squalid conditions with little food, water or shelter from the cold.\n\nDuring the first phase, the volume of aid entering Gaza is supposed to reach more than 500 trucks per day, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday \u2014 a more than sixfold increase over the average number in December.\n\nBut even once the bombs stop falling, steep challenges will remain in getting lifesaving assistance to civilians who need it, including abiding lawlessness in Gaza, destroyed roads and onerous Israeli inspection processes for cargoes entering the territory, aid workers say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of hope and opportunity, but we should be under no illusions how tough it will still be to get support to survivors,\u201d U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said in a statement. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nMohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign affairs minister, spoke on Jan. 15, as Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. (Video: Reuters)\n\nIsraeli forces will remain in a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a news conference in Doha, where negotiators spent the last few days hammering out the deal. After a week, if the truce holds, Palestinian civilians sheltering in southern and central Gaza will be allowed to return to the north, which in recent months has been decimated by intense Israeli bombardment and clashes with Hamas militants.\n\nSince October, Israeli forces have besieged the northernmost part of the enclave, blocking most aid and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Israel divided the territory into a north and south with a line of fortified checkpoints known as the Netzarim Corridor just outside Gaza City, only occasionally allowing humanitarians to cross into northern areas.\n\nNegotiations for Phase 2 of the deal \u2014 during which the remaining living hostages would be released and Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza \u2014 are supposed to begin in the coming weeks. During Phase 3, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who were killed and the reconstruction of Gaza would get underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal has offered a glimmer of hope in a conflict that has taken an immense human toll: Israeli attacks have killed more than 46,700 people in Gaza and injured more than 110,200, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 405 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.\n\nA war that began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel spiraled into a regional conflagration, marked by more than a year of exchanges of fire between Israel and its allies and Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThere was still much that could go wrong during the deal\u2019s implementation, and Israeli officials have emphasized that so far, it is a temporary pause. The thorniest questions \u2014 including who will govern and secure Gaza \u2014 remain unresolved, and negotiations over these and other issues are expected to begin later in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment of Gaza hasn\u2019t let up: At least 19 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the territory on Wednesday night after the ceasefire was announced.\n\nStill, even before mediator Qatar declared that a deal was reached, celebrations broke out in Gaza and among hostage families and supporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement shortly after the announcement insisting that some details still needed to be worked out. But President-elect Donald Trump had already blasted out the news to the world, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cWE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday night, the parties were still arguing over the names of high-profile prisoners to be released under the agreement, according to an official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s cabinet and members of his coalition government must vote on Thursday morning to approve the deal. His far-right allies in government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, both slammed the agreement as a bad deal that spares Hamas and threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nStill, the prime minister is widely expected to have enough votes to push through the agreement, and Israel\u2019s Supreme Court is expected to dismiss possible legal challenges to the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is an important move. This is a necessary move,\u201d Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in televised remarks Wednesday night, urging the government to make the ceasefire official. \u201cThere is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us \u2014 whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.\u201d\n\nLeaders from mediating countries appeared to dismiss the procedural steps in Israel as mere formalities. Qatar\u2019s Mohammed, Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi each declared victory after months of stop-and-start negotiations that repeatedly saw negotiators and intelligence chiefs huddle in Middle Eastern capitals, only to return home empty-handed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cToo many innocent people have died. Too many communities have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe mediators, at least for now, overcame the herculean task of reconciling the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas. Israel wanted to continue the fighting after a temporary pause and hostage-for-prisoner exchange, while Hamas insisted on a permanent end to the war before it would surrender any captives.\n\nBut pressure on both parties pushed them to close the gap. Netanyahu was under fire from hostage families and those who lost loved ones in the war. He was also in potential legal peril abroad, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas was severely weakened after Israel killed its top leaders and kneecapped regional allies. Residents grew increasingly angry as they struggled to survive the punishing campaign Israel launched in response to the Hamas attacks.\n\nIn the end, the deal agreed to Wednesday aligns to a large extent with the phased approach Biden proposed in May: An initial pause in hostilities and release of hostages is intended to lead to \u201csustainable calm,\u201d according to a joint statement by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Those three countries are meant to serve as guarantors of the deal, and Mohammed said a monitoring body would be established in Cairo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden and Trump each claimed credit for a diplomatic achievement closed through rare foreign-policy collaboration between the outgoing and incoming administrations. As Biden officials carried out the formal diplomacy, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, met with Netanyahu over the weekend to pressure the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nBiden said \u201cthis deal was developed and negotiated under my administration\u201d but that his officials had been speaking \u201cas one team\u201d with their soon-to-be successors in recent days.\n\nHamas leader Khalil al-Hayya hailed the ceasefire as a triumph for the militant group: \u201cToday we prove that the occupation will never defeat our people and their resistance,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHospitals in Israel are preparing to receive hostages who may be malnourished, injured or ill \u2014 and will certainly be traumatized, Israeli media reported.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, where thousands have gathered for months each Saturday night to protest the government\u2019s failure to bring all of the hostages home sooner, crowds beat drums and chanted.\n\n\u201cI hope it will not just be a ceasefire but a stop to the war,\u201d said Benjamin Terem, 65, from Tel Aviv. \u201cWe cannot stay in this situation.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, 20-year-old Farah Hathout said she was displaced nine times throughout the war. She woke up where she is sheltering in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, to check the news.\n\n\u201cIs it real? Have they signed?\u201d she said she asked herself.\n\n\u201cI pray it goes through,\u201d said Hathout, who was in tears. \u201cMay God compensate us for what we experienced.\u201d\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington, Shih from Jerusalem, Balousha from Toronto and Mahfouz from Cairo. Miriam Berger and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv, Mohamad El Chamaa in Beirut, and Hajar Harb in London contributed to this report."

Investors also watched the Capitol Hill confirmation hearing of President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped more than 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell almost 0.9%, leading the way down, as several large-cap tech stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) underperformed.\n\nMarkets were coming off a major one-day rally on the heels of a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders.\n\nTraders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report.\n\nRetail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November\u2019s 0.7% increase.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were down less than 1% on the day. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock rose more than 4% after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell.\n\nElsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's (UNH) fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid about 6%.\n\nAlso taking focus Thursday was the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Bessent's confirmation.

            "article_content": "Recent data breaches have highlighted the critical need to improve guest Wi-Fi infrastructure security in modern business environments. Organizations face increasing pressure to protect their networks while providing convenient access to visitors, contractors, temporary staff, and employees with BYOD. Implementing secure guest Wi-Fi infrastructure has become essential for authenticating access, protecting data, maintaining compliance across all geographies, and ensuring business continuity.\n\nEvolved security solutions now combine zero-trust architecture with cloud-based captive portals to enhance network protection. These systems enable organizations to implement strict access controls, verify every device's security status, and maintain network separation. Through advanced features like conditional access and device registration, businesses can now offer secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining complete visibility and control over their network resources.\n\nChallenges in Wi-Fi Security Today\n\nDistributed organizations implementing guest Wi-Fi networks face increasingly sophisticated security challenges. The complexity of implementing and managing secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining network integrity has become a critical concern for both IT administrators and Security practitioners.\n\nCommon security vulnerabilities\n\nModern guest Wi-Fi networks face several significant security threats:\n\nLack of Network Micro-Segmentation: Networks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.\n\nNetworks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. Weak Encryption: Most of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association.\n\nMost of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data.\n\nAttackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data. Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently.

            "article_content": "Let\u2019s imagine a fictional company, Global Retail Corporation, a multinational retail chain struggling with its initial approach to AI integration. They built custom generative AI applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI\u2019s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (large language models) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal results. That all changed when they adopted federated learning.\n\nThe strategy of federation in AI deployments\n\nFederated learning is emerging as a game-changing approach for enterprises looking to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining data privacy and security. Rather than moving sensitive data to LLM providers or building isolated small language models (SLMs), federated learning enables organizations to train LLMs using their private data where it resides. Everyone who worries about moving private enterprise data to a public space, such as uploading it to an LLM, can continue to have \u201cprivate data.\u201d Private data may exist on a public cloud provider or in your data center.\n\nThe real power of federation comes from the tight integration between private enterprise data and sophisticated LLM capabilities. This integration allows companies to leverage their proprietary information and broader knowledge in models like GPT-4 or Google Gemini without compromising security. More importantly, it means not having to deal with moving petabytes of data to a public cloud that\u2019s also hosting an LLM."

When it is done, it will be opened to the public to explore.\n\nTwo skeletons were also found in the house, with analysis of the pair revealing the shocking events following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, as one of them, a woman, was holding onto jewellery and coins.\n\nTrying to protect themselves in a small room, they were brutally killed as a mix of superheated volcanic gas and ash, also called a pyroclastic flow, made its way through Pompeii.\n\nDespite all the discoveries made, a third of the city still lies underneath the volcanic debris, though this new excavation, the most extensive in years, has provided more information about Roman life.\n\nThe archaeologists have been followed by a BBC documentary team for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig, which is available to watch on BBC iPlayer."

            "article_content": "Astronaut James Irwin salutes in front of the landing module of the Apollo 15 on the moon in 1971.\n\nThe internet is absolutely full of myths and urban legends about space and just about everything else, so readers must be a skeptical these days.\n\nFrom claims of aliens crashing on Earth and UFOs being hidden on military bases, to Mars being abnormally large and the moon turning green, space tends to attract some outlandish or at least highly unproven claims that should be vetted carefully.\n\nHere are some of the biggest space myths and conspiracy theories that just won't go away.\n\n1. The Apollo moon landings were fake\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin assemble the American flag on the moon during their Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station marked the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch with a video message on July 16. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n2. NASA is a lie\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket arrives at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building on Sept. 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA's Kennedy Space Center)\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n3. The Earth is flat\n\nEarth as seen from space (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space \u2014 which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.\n\n\n\nOne way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n4. Planet Nine will kill us\n\nArtist's illustration of the hypothetical Planet Nine, which may lie undiscovered in the outer solar system. (Image credit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.\n\n\n\nAlthough the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n5. Alien research is happening at Area 51\n\nArea 51's restricted area covers over 90,000 acres (36,000 hectares) . (Image credit: Roger Holden via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology \u2014 recovered from crashed flying saucers \u2014 are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.\n\n\n\nWhile the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret \u2014 not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n6. There is a killer planet known as \"Nibiru\"\n\nArtist's conception of the fictional rogue planet Nibiru, or Planet X. Nibiru does not exist, so don't be fooled. (Image credit: gilderm | sxc.hu)\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.\n\n\n\nYears later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n7. There is a face on Mars\n\nThe original 'Face on Mars' image taken by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, in grey scale, on July, 25 1976. Image shows a remnant massif located in the Cydonia region. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.\n\n\n\nNASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n8. The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star\n\nSaturn's moon Iapetus. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"\n\n\n\nA Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n9. Saturn's hexagon is alien technology\n\nThis movie, made from images obtained by Cassini's imaging cameras, is the first to show Saturn's hexagon in color filters and the first movie to show a complete view from the north pole down to about 70 degrees north latitude. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Hampton University)\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n10. Mars is as big as the moon\n\nThe solar system to scale. The diameter of Jupiter (middle, with red spot) is about 11 times that of Earth (third planet from the left). Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system (fourth planet from left). (Image credit: Lunar and Planetary Institute)\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d.
