            "category": "ufo",
            "date": "The Express Tribune14h",
            "source": "The Express Tribune",
            "article_content": "When George Knapp, aka the UFO reporter, interviewed John Lear for a TV show, he was sceptical about the claims the maker of Lear jets made on air about the US government's cover up of five alien bodies cryogenically preserved and the flying saucers in its possession. However, after the show, the phones at the TV station rang off their hooks; viewers of the show called in to share their personal experiences of UFO sightings and strange encounters of the third kind.\n\nThirty years ago, the Las Vegas-based journalist Knapp broke the news about Area 51 in Nevada. Last year, he was among the audience of the US congressional hearing about reporting unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) as a face that stood out for many in the media as well as the ufologist community. On the occasion, three military veterans testified and shared their experiences regarding UAPs. The Pentagon released a trove of classified information about UAPs as the number of reported sightings rose sharply.\n\nInvestigation Alien follows the dogged Knapp as he tries to blow the cover off of the US government's persistent refutation of alien encounters. As far back as 1947 in Roswell a UFO was reported by the US military itself but it retracted the claim within 24 hours under the pretext of a weather balloon.\n\nThe Netflix docuseries encapsulates Knapp's work as a UFO journalist as he traces the trail of various UFO sightings and unexplainable phenomena across America.\n\nKnapp presents himself as any other investigative journalist, chasing a story like a scent hound, aiming to throw open an undisclosed reality to the public. His methodology appears credible and he ropes in a couple of other people to carry out interviews as well.\n\nKnapp gets a former CIA case officer Douglas Laux to work on this documentary with him, as a pair of fresh eyes. Laux claims he doesn't have preconceived notions about non-human intelligence but that he will gauge everyone's stories with an open and unbiased mind. The ex-spy, who knows Pashto and Dari, speaks in a measured tone and doesn't express himself in words that would make him appear a UFO enthusiast. That's the groundwork laid for creating a voice that viewers will more likely believe. Except if you're a true sceptic. Just because an ex-military man is enunciating clearly that he is holding a piece of unbreakable UFO debris from 50 years ago, does not mean that sceptics will believe him more.\n\nThe first mystery they explore is of cattle mutilation. They talk to ranchers who have had their animals mutilated in an inexplicable way as if they were cut by a laser. The catch is there is no blood. One rancher says 20 or so mutilations have occurred over the last four years.\n\nThey also see a few crop circles although they are not elaborately patterned but just flattened grass. Knapp wonders why these mysteries are not investigated by the government? Is it dismissal or simply awareness that keeps the authorities from investigating these weird anomalies. Laux revisits a scene of cattle mutilation that still has bones scattered around. \u201cYou can't explain it a lot so you don't talk about it,\u201d says a rancher.\n\nWith Vee Armour, the first Black female military pilot, Knapp investigates an incident from the late 1970s in Colares, Brazil where hundreds of people were burned by laser. Vee meets a couple of women who narrate their experience of seeing a beam of light from the sky and being burned in the chest by it. The scars are still very lightly visible. In fact, Colares turns out to be a territory where alien phenomena are witnessed somewhat frequently. Knapp even meets a local who says he saw a fireball in the sky just weeks ago and shows him videos and photos of it.\n\nEveryone knows\n\nIn Tampico, Mexico, Laux and Knapp investigate the possibility of submerged UAPs with the help of a magnometer. An unusual magnetic reading sparks questions about what could be the cause. The duo asks a geologist at a military institute who is just as puzzled. It could be a cylindrical object at rest or maybe just dips in the seabed. There is no conclusive answer for the reading.\n\nWhile working for Knapp, an underwater archeologist and his friend witness a light in the sky \u2013 on film. It's not a crazy moment but almost mundane. The archaeologist later recounts to Knapp that the light in the sky travelled something like 200 miles in five seconds. The night holds even more surprises. When everyone on the boat is asleep other than the explorers\u2019 night watchman, a light is seen on the horizon which descends into the water. What are the odds of alien ships appearing on the evening a Netflix documentary is being filmed for evidence of UAPs? Very likely, in this spot.\n\nAlthough combat pilot Vee offers a possible explanation from a military perspective of a recon exercise, the documentary doesn't dwell too much on the sighting caught on film. Viewers are left to decide whether the documentary itself is presenting truth or hoax.\n\nSimilarly when Knapp is trying to corroborate another UAP sighting, the experiment they undertake to prove its legitimacy is sadly lame. A man claimed that the plume from a thermite explosion he and his friends ignited looked like a spaceship and caused people to think it was a UFO crash with residual debris. By this time in the docuseries, Knapp's methodology of cross-checking has become counterintuitive.\n\nThe filmmakers have relied on mostly ex marines for collecting information, or PhD holders. The selection of interview subjects should lend authority to the debate; on the other hand, it may also come across as contrived and forced.\n\nWhereas this is an enjoyable enough watch, the documentary is neither here nor there. Believers might think it presents convincing enough proof of ET life but not nailed down as it should be, whereas sceptics will pick many loopholes in the presentation of evidence and corroborative interviews that try so hard to appear factual.\n\nAs an American production, the investigation focuses only on North and South America. Casting a vaster net to explore sightings across the world in person would make for a hugely more compelling documentary. The series briefly mentions landmark mass sightings in Italy and Belgium. However the biggest was in Phoenix, Arizona so it explored the 1997 incident (which actors Kurt Russell also witnessed from a plane) in more detail.\n\nPilots around the world are probably a segment to contact for documenting unidentified phenomena in the skies. In Investigation Alien, two Commercial pilots show videos they filmed while flying over the Pacific of lights in the sky. The air control tower revealed the lights had been orbiting for two successive nights. The pilots interviewed say one out of three times, they see something unexplainable in the skies and reiterate such events are witnessed worldwide, not just in the US.\n\nA Pakistani pilot indeed reported a UAP near Rahim Yar Khan in 2021 during a Karachi to Lahore flight. He described seeing a very shiny object despite the sunlight, and locals down below saw it too. In 2022, a man captured a 12 minute long footage of a \u201cbulging triangle UFO\u201d flying over Islamabad.\n\nInstead of the ghost hunter shows on local TV channels, some channels can boldly investigate such sightings of alien life instead, if it doesn't hurt the religious sentiments of our population.\n\nMessage of peace\n\nThe docuseries ends with a quick look at the reason behind alien contact. Those who witnessed the Phoenix lights overall felt a sense of calm and felt blessed to have witnessed the phenomenon. To them the lights from another world were gentle, not menacing and brought a message of peace. Many who have experienced UAP sightings get emotional and feel they have been conveyed by aliens to look after Planet Earth. Some feel the message is to stop messing with nuclear weapons. Some are comforted by the thought that we are not alone.\n\nIt probably is not a source of comfort for the women who got burned in Colares by rays of light from the sky. Or for that matter ranchers who wake up and see their cows and bulls eerily killed and drained of blood.\n\nAn anthropologist interviewed in the Netflix docuseries posits that the form of being we call alien in our collective imagination might just be a part of our family tree. He has extrapolated the evolution of the shape of the human skull through time.\n\nAs our heads have grown bigger in the evolutionary process, they will grow bigger still, he says, and eventually, our faces will become smaller as the eyes wrap around the side of the head. That paints a resemblance of what is known as the grey alien in sci-fi lore.\n\nYes, I think this will hurt not just religious sentiments but redefine our sense of vanity, and that would be more of a test."

            "article_content": "eWEEK content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\nGoogle has unveiled a new feature for its Pixel devices that uses AI to identify and alert users to potential scam calls in real time. Currently in beta, this AI fraud detection feature is available in the Phone by Google app for Pixel 6 and newer devices, with Pixel 9 users leveraging the cutting-edge Gemini Nano for detection.\n\nHow Real-Time AI Fraud Detection Works\n\nThe new feature monitors calls from unknown numbers in real time, flagging suspicious activity without storing or sharing sensitive data. It operates automatically in the background, ensuring existing contacts remain unaffected.\n\nIf a scam is suspected, users are alerted with a vibration, sound, and a warning message, \u201cSuspicious activity detected.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cEnd call\u201d button allows them to immediately terminate the conversation, while a \u201cNot a scam\u201d option can be used to mark legitimate calls.\n\nThe feature relies on on-device processing, ensuring all data remains private and secure. The Fraud Detection feature is disabled by default. You can enable it manually in the Phone app under the Assistive category, which also houses features like Call Screen and Hold for Me. Once activated, it seamlessly integrates with the app to provide real-time scam detection.\n\nPixel 9 devices use Google\u2019s advanced Gemini Nano technology for detection, while Pixel 6 and newer models leverage other machine learning models. Google has emphasized that no audio recordings or transcripts are stored, with all processing conducted locally on the device. This privacy-focused approach sets the feature apart from traditional call-screening tools, offering robust protection while respecting user data.\n\nLimitations and Availability\n\nThe AI-based fraud detection feature is in beta and available only for U.S. users running version 154 of the Phone by Google app. It supports English language calls and is not guaranteed to detect every scam due to fraudsters\u2019 ever-evolving tactics.\n\nDespite these limitations, the tool represents a step forward in combating increasingly sophisticated scam calls. However, some have criticized its limited availability, urging Google to expand access to more regions and languages.\n\nA Step Toward Safer Calls\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest effort in fraud detection with AI analytics demonstrates the potential for real-time scam prevention on smartphones. As scams grow more complex, tools like this offer users greater control over their security.\n\nWhile still in its early stages, this innovation underscores Google\u2019s commitment to protecting users against fraud and highlights the growing role of AI fraud detection software in safeguarding everyday communications."

            "article_content": "In the new horror movie, \u201cHeretic,\u201d Hugh Grant plays a diabolical religious skeptic who traps two scared missionaries in his house and tries to violently shake their faith.\n\nWhat starts more as a religious studies lecture slowly morphs into a gory escape room for the two door-knocking members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, underscoring just how well-suited religion can be for terrifying and entertaining thrill-seeking moviegoers.\n\n\u201cI think it is a fascinating religion-related horror as it raises questions about the institution of religion, the patriarchy of religion,\u201d said Stacey Abbott, a film professor at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, whose research interests include horror, vampires and zombies.\n\n\u201cBut it also questions the nature of faith and confronts the audience with a debate about choice, faith and free will.\u201d\n\nHorror has had a decades-long attraction to religion, Christianity especially in the U.S., with the 1970s \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Omen\u201d being prime examples. Beyond the jump scares, the supernatural elements of horror and its sublime nature pair easily with belief and spirituality \u2014 and religion\u2019s exploration of big existential questions, Abbott said. Horror is subversive. Real-life taboo topics and cultural anxieties are fair game.\n\n\u201cIt is a rich canvas for social critique and it can also be a space to reassert traditional values,\u201d Abbott said in an email.\n\nDeath, demons and other tough topics religion and horror address\n\nReligions and horror tackle similar questions about what it means to be human \u2014 how people relate to one another and the world, said Brandon Grafius, a Biblical studies professor at Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit and an expert on Christianity and horror.\n\n\u201cSo much of religion is about how we grapple with the reality of death. \u2026 Helping us make meaning even in the face of that reality,\u201d said Grafius. \u201cHorror really serves that same process, as a way to reflect on death.\u201d\n\nNot only does Christianity translate well for U.S. audiences, it has a lot of raw material for moviemakers to work with, he said.\n\n\u201cChristianity emerged as a strongly dualistic religion, where forces are either good or evil,\u201d Grafius said. \u201cEven though the U.S. is moving away from being a nation dominated by Christianity, we still have that dualism deep in our bones.\u201d\n\nAmong the more recent religion-themed horror films, \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d franchise, including \u201cThe Nun\u201d movies, show paranormal investigators battling demons, Abbott said, while \u201cThe First Omen\u201d and \u201cImmaculate\u201d offer critiques of patriarchal attempts to control women\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cThese films seem to be a direct response to many of the debates that are happening in the U.S. these days,\u201d Abbott wrote in her email. \u201cThese different approaches to religion in horror illustrate the way in which the genre is engaging with a very live debate around religion or more specifically how religion is being used to assert control (which is what \u2018Heretic\u2019 is all about).\u201d\n\nGrant, who plays Mr. Reed in the new movie, told The Associated Press that he shared some of his \u201cHeretic\u201d character\u2019s skepticism, although not necessarily from a religious perspective:\n\n\u201cThere is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit.\u201d\n\nHorror can be challenging. It acts as a dark mirror that can reveal things people don\u2019t want to admit and fears they don\u2019t want to face, said the Rev. Ryan Duns, a Jesuit priest and theology chair at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\nIf done well, both religion and horror are unsettling, he said.\n\n\u201cReligion, when it unsettles, asks us am I living up to the person I have been called to be or am I complicit in systems of violence, oppression, injustice, going with the status quo,\u201d said Duns, who wrote the \u201cTheology of Horror\u201d and teaches a course on it as well. \u201cIn the horror movie, the monster threatens normality \u2014 threatens to destroy our status quo.\u201d\n\nBut they deviate from there. In horror, there is no way out, Duns said. He pointed out that defeating a movie\u2019s monster doesn\u2019t prevent sequels, hence \u201cJaws 2,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d \u201cReturn of the Killer Tomatoes\u201d and more.\n\nIn Christianity, it is Jesus and the Gospels threatening the status quo, but they offer hope and a way out, he said.\n\nTi West mixes religion into the narrative of his new movie, \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d a horror film about an adult film star trying to break into mainstream movies. West, who also wrote and directed \u201cThe Sacrament,\u201d a horror movie inspired by the Jonestown Massacre in 1978, said he doesn\u2019t actively set out to tell stories with prominent religion narratives, but religion can be ripe for mining.\n\n\u201cIt kind of depends on the story,\u201d West said, \u201cAnything with morality wrapped up into it, they kind of go hand in hand at times. And it\u2019s like religion is such a major part of every culture everywhere that \u2026 I feel like sometimes it\u2019s such a major part of life that gets put aside in movies.\u201d\n\nWhen religion works in horror \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t\n\nBeyond poor storytelling, the mixing of horror and religion can go wrong if the movie is meant to offend the believers of a particular faith, said Lisa Morton, an award-winning horror author whose written books on Halloween and paranormal history.\n\nBut it can really go right. Morton\u2019s all-time favorite movie is \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a holy horror icon and a peak example of the genre. \u201cThe Omen\u201d followed it.\n\n\u201cAll of the contemporary bloodlines kind of trace back through those two,\u201d said Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how they keep getting rebooted over and over.\u201d\n\nAbbott agrees religion should be portrayed respectfully, just as she expects accuracy and respect for science in movies, though not every detail needs to be perfect. \u201cBut some horror films, like exorcism movies, are built upon the fact that they are drawing upon real rituals and then taking them to a more extreme conclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nOsgood Perkins, who wrote and directed \u201cLonglegs,\u201d a horror movie about an occultist serial killer, invented the religious material in his film, piecing together whatever felt right from his imagination and real life.\n\n\u201cI just make it up,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cBut then you catch hold of something like the Bible verse and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this is really rich.\u2019 Beasts coming out of the sea with heads and horns and crowns and things like that. I didn\u2019t make that up.\u201d\n\nFor Duns, an accurate portrayal of religious rituals and symbols \u2014 without over doing it \u2014 can add heft to a scene.\n\n\u201cThe rituals of the churches have been stylized and lived out for centuries,\u201d Duns said. \u201cWhen movies are silly or are sloppy with it, the power of the gesture and the power of the symbols are lost.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Krysta Fauria contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Discovering strange and unexpected things is what makes planetary exploration so exciting.\"\n\nSulfates are salts that form when sulfur, usually in compound form, mixes with other minerals in water.\n\nWhen the water evaporates, the minerals mix and dry out, leaving the sulfates behind.\n\nThese sulfate minerals can tell us a lot about Mars, such as its water history, and how it has weathered over time.\n\nPure sulfur, on the other hand, only forms under a very narrow set of conditions, which are not known to have occurred in the region of Mars where Curiosity made its discovery.\n\nThere are, to be fair, a lot of things we don't know about the geological history of Mars, but the discovery of scads of pure sulfur just hanging about on the Martian surface suggests that there's something pretty big that we're not aware of.\n\nSulfur, it's important to understand, is an essential element for all life. It's usually taken up in the form of sulfates, and used to make two of the essential amino acids living organisms need to make proteins.\n\nSince we've known about sulfates on Mars for some time, the discovery doesn't tell us anything new in that area. We're yet to find any signs of life on Mars, anyway.\n\nBut we do keep stumbling across the remains of bits and pieces that living organisms would find useful, including chemistry, water, and past habitable conditions.\n\nStuck here on Earth, we're fairly limited in how we can access Mars. Curiosity's instruments were able to analyze and identify the sulfurous rocks in the Gediz Vallis Channel, but if it hadn't taken a route that rolled over and cracked one open, it could have been sometime until we found the sulfur.\n\nThe next step will be to figure out exactly how, based on what we know about Mars, that sulfur may have come to be there.\n\nThat's going to take a bit more work, possibly involving some detailed modeling of Mars's geological evolution.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nMeanwhile, Curiosity will continue to collect data on the same.\n\nThe Gediz Vallis channel is an area rich in Martian history, an ancient waterway whose rocks now bear the imprint of the ancient river that once flowed over them, billions of years ago.\n\nCuriosity drilled a hole in one of the rocks, taking a powdered sample of its interior for chemical analysis, and is still trundling its way deeper along the channel, to see what other surprises might be waiting just around the next rock.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in July 2024."

            "article_content": "The Red Planet has always been a subject of intrigue and fascination. Recent research led by Curtin University has added more fuel to this age-old curiosity. The scientists discovered what could possibly be the oldest evidence of hot water activity on Mars.\n\nThis discovery opens up possibilities that at some point in its mysterious past, Mars may have been a place where life could exist.\n\nHot water on Mars\n\nThe study focused on a zircon grain from the renowned Martian meteorite NWA7034, fondly known as Black Beauty. This tiny grain, although no larger than a grain of sand, holds secrets dating back billions of years.\n\nThe analysis of the 4.45 billion-year-old zircon grain revealed geochemical fingerprints of ancient water-rich fluids. These traces of the past suggest that hot water was once present on Mars.\n\nDr. Aaron Cavosie from Curtin\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences noted that this discovery opens new paths for understanding early Martian hydrothermal systems and the planet\u2019s past habitability.\n\n\u201cWe used nano-scale geochemistry to detect elemental evidence of hot water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago,\u201d said Dr. Cavosie.\n\nEarly conditions on Mars\n\nHydrothermal systems are vital for the development of life. They were crucial for life to flourish on Earth. Dr. Cavosie noted that the same essential ingredients for habitable environments were present on Mars during its early crust formation period.\n\nThe team utilized nano-scale imaging and spectroscopy to identify essential elements on the zircon grain, including iron, aluminum, yttrium, and sodium.\n\nThe presence and pattern of these elements, added during the zircon\u2019s formation billions of years ago, suggest that water was present during early Martian magmatic activity.\n\nThis intriguing discovery indicates that during the initial stages of the Red Planet\u2019s existence, conditions were conducive to the existence of water.\n\nResilience of Mars\u2019 crust\n\nThe study also highlighted the resilience of Mars\u2019 crust. Despite enduring massive meteorite impacts, causing upheaval of its surface, Mars still had water during the early Pre-Noachian period, which was before about 4.1 billion years ago.\n\nIn 2022, Curtin researchers studied the same zircon grain. They found that it had been \u201cshocked\u201d by a meteorite impact, marking it as the first and only known shocked zircon from Mars.\n\nImplications for life on Mars\n\nThe discovery of ancient hydrothermal activity on Mars significantly changes our understanding of the planet\u2019s potential for life. Hydrothermal systems could have created environments rich in chemical energy and nutrients vital for life.\n\nThe presence of warm, mineral-laden waters in Mars\u2019 crust could have served as a cradle for microbial communities, much like the hydrothermal vents on Earth harbor diverse ecosystems despite the absence of sunlight.\n\nThis implies that if life ever existed on early Mars, hydrothermal systems may have been havens, providing conditions to support some form of life.\n\nThe research offers valuable insights into planetary habitability within our solar system and beyond.\n\nFuture research directions\n\nThe revelations from the zircon grain continue to ignite curiosity and lay the groundwork for future Mars exploration missions.\n\nPlanetary scientists are eager to explore other ancient Martian rocks and meteorites that might hold additional clues about Mars\u2019 hydrothermal systems and geological history.\n\nMissions equipped with advanced technology could further investigate the surface and subsurface of Mars, searching for more evidence of past water activity and potential biological markers.\n\nThese future efforts could significantly enhance our understanding of the Red Planet and refine our search for life beyond Earth, spurring innovative technologies and methodologies in planetary science research.\n\nEarly Mars and its water activity\n\nThis recent study builds on previous research, taking us a step closer to understanding what early Mars was like.\n\nAccording to Dr. Cavosie, identifying the signs of water-rich fluids from the zircon\u2019s formation period provides geochemical markers of water in the oldest known Martian crust.\n\nThe research was conducted by scientists from Curtin\u2019s Space Science and Technology Centre, the John de Laeter Centre, and the University of Adelaide.\n\nDr. Jack Gillespie is the lead author of the paper detailing study, which is set to be published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "In 1905, a young American scientist named William Coolidge set to work on an ambitious assignment for his new job at General Electric: creating a better light bulb. The carbon filament used in Thomas Edison\u2019s world-changing invention wasn\u2019t very energy efficient. Scientists were experimenting with tungsten, which had the advantage of a higher melting point, but the metal wire was too brittle and broke easily.\n\nSeveral years later, after numerous trials, errors, and accidents\u2014by some accounts, a breakthrough occurred when the tungsten rod fell into liquid mercury pooling from the heating system\u2014Coolidge created \u201cductile tungsten,\u201d a more bendable form of the metal that ultimately became the wiring still found inside incandescent light bulbs today.\n\nEkin Dogus Cubuk, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, points to ductile tungsten as an example of how new materials can revolutionize existing technologies\u2014often after careful, laborious efforts riddled with unexpected twists and turns. More than 100 years after that landmark innovation, his team has created an AI tool that could transform the way scientists discover new materials. Much like ductile tungsten, any of these compounds could improve upon current materials and lead to next-generation electric vehicle (EV) batteries or better solar panels. \u201cMany materials discoveries involve a lot of trial and error, luck, and serendipity,\u201d Cubuk says. \u201cWith AI we hope to reduce the reliance on luck. We have the potential to accelerate each stage of the process, from discovery to development, with more accurate and scalable predictions.\u201d\n\nGNoME catapults materials discovery\n\nThe AI tool that Cubuk\u2019s team built is called GNoME (Graph Networks for Materials Exploration), and it has used deep learning to determine the structure of 2.2 million inorganic crystals. Of those, GNoME identified 380,000 materials that are stable at low temperatures, according to simulations. \u201cWe hope that having this information will help the community to catapult further breakthroughs in materials discovery and design,\u201d Cubuk explains.\n\nSince the public release of these crystals in 2023, scientists have been experimenting with AI-identified compounds in labs worldwide\u2014including three that were recently synthesized in Japan by researchers at Hokkaido University.\n\n\u201cThere is a wealth of AI knowledge, but currently there\u2019s a gap between translating those insights to material synthesis in the lab. This early research shows how we can bridge the gap to explore new materials more efficiently,\u201d says Akira Miura, an associate professor at Hokkaido University, who led the study.\n\nMeanwhile, GNoME independently identified hundreds of crystals that scientists had already discovered on their own as stable, including \u201cexciting\u201d superconductor candidates, according to Cubuk. Furthermore, hundreds of these crystals were independently synthesized by labs around the world. That\u2019s a strong signal that the new material candidates in GNoME\u2019s findings have real-life viability.\n\nGNoME was initially trained with data on crystal structures that is available through the Materials Project, an open-source reference that has been central to new materials discovery. Identifying the structure of a new material is just the beginning of what can be a long, intensive development process. The original idea of the Materials Project was to reduce invention time by focusing experiments on compounds with the most potential for success, according to founder and UC Berkeley professor Kristin Persson. That itself was a game changer from the days when Persson was a graduate student in the mid-\u201990s and had to comb through oversize tomes to look up a material\u2019s chemical structure and properties. In the laboratory, researchers would combine intuition with past results to inform their experimentation. \u201cThere were no recipes for it except in the researcher\u2019s brain,\u201d Persson says. \u201cThey would use their experience to make new materials, and it would take a long time.\u201d\n\nNot that long ago, it was relatively rare to be able to calculate a new material on the computer that was thermodynamically stable, explains Chris Wolverton, a professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University. For one, the sheer magnitude of the required computational power was a hurdle. \u201cGoogle is particularly rich when it comes to computational time and power,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were able to\u2014in a very short order\u2014calculate the properties of several million compounds.\u201d\n\nThe availability of this vast data trove is opening up new possibilities to materials researchers, says Persson. \u201cThey\u2019re giving this body of work to the community and saying, \u2018Do what you want with it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the new kid on the block in terms of the tools we have. If you\u2019re a materials company and not thinking of machine learning, you\u2019re behind, and Google put a brilliant spotlight on that.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean researchers are suddenly going to have piles of new materials cluttering their lab benches. The tool has identified crystals that computations predict will be stable under absolute zero, or about -273C\u2014an ideal condition in which particle motions come to a stop. A key question persists: Can these crystals be created in a stable form that won\u2019t change or decompose at room temperature? Myriad factors, including temperature and pressure, can influence whether a theoretical compound can exist in a form that would become, say, the next EV battery. Scientists will have to figure out the right experimental methods to create materials that will be useful in innovation. \u201cThat\u2019s the next giant challenge in this field: predicting synthesis recipes,\u201d Wolverton says.\n\nMaterials scientists explore next steps\n\nIndeed, the tremendous scale of the AI findings has spurred important conversations about the best way to identify and synthesize new materials. A researcher may spend an entire career conducting experiments on just a few compounds, a painstakingly slow and labor-intensive process. The key is finding a balance between creating AI-led possibilities and developing the known science, explains University of Liverpool professor Andy Cooper, whose research group focuses on ways to accelerate the discovery of functional materials: \u201cI think that\u2019s a challenge for the future. What is the right place to be on that spectrum?\u201d\n\nNew materials improve the foundations of modern life\n\nAt Google DeepMind, Cubuk envisions a future when new materials could reshape today\u2019s most exciting technologies\u2014from semiconductors to new power sources for supercomputers. As AI tools evolve, a key challenge is determining which potential materials best correspond to technologies and products, Cubuk explains. For example, knowing what criteria makes a good lithium-ion conductor helps researchers better identify the most promising candidates. Already, the GNoME team has identified 528 potential materials for batteries\u2014more than 25 times the number identified in a 2017 study, which was led by Austin Sendek, the CEO of Aionics, a technology company dedicated to designing high-performance batteries with AI.\n\nGenerative AI can predict the next big thing. As we exhaust what\u2019s known, we have to develop new ways to push boundaries, and this is one of those paths. Jakoah Brgoch, associate professor of chemistry at the University of Houston\n\nAI\u2019s contributions might also open up researchers\u2019 minds to unforeseen possibilities, says Jakoah Brgoch, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Houston, whose work explores functional inorganic materials. Maybe the AI-suggested compounds aren\u2019t viable under current lab temperatures and pressure, for example; but what happens if you alter those variables? \u201cScience is often a slog,\u201d Brgoch says. \u201cThe hope and the hype is we don\u2019t have to go through this slog. Generative AI can predict the next big thing. As we exhaust what\u2019s known, we have to develop new ways to push boundaries, and this is one of those paths. Of course, experimentally validating these predictions is easier said than done.\u201d\n\nAccording to current industry wisdom, new material discovery requires, on average, at least 10 years of work and north of $10 million to $100 million. While the cost to build a factory is the same, what used to take weeks to simulate on a computer can now be done in seconds with AI, says Sendek.\n\n\u201cAI-based materials discovery methods will unlock unorthodox solutions that would have otherwise eluded human intuition, while also leading to fewer \u2018dead ends\u2019 that cannot be commercialized,\u201d says Sendek, pointing to the recent discovery by Aionics\u2019s AI system that adding a luxury perfume molecule to a battery\u2019s electrolyte could improve the battery\u2019s overall performance. Aionics is now actively testing this molecule in real-life batteries.\n\n\u201cMaking meaningful progress in materials innovation requires us to discover better materials faster and then get them to market in a fraction of the time.\u201d"

            "article_content": "There seems to be growing consensus among AI leaders that the field could end up transforming all of science and technology at a rate previously thought unimaginable.\n\nAfter Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei had said that AI could bring about a 100 years\u2019 worth of scientific progress in just 5-10 years, Google\u2019s AI Chief Demis Hassabis has echoed his thoughts. \u201cI really do feel like we\u2019re on the brink of a new golden era of discovery,\u201d he said at a conference. \u201cI think what we need is a lot more interdisciplinary science. So using AI and asking the right questions with domain experts, it\u2019s, it\u2019s almost limitless what its applications could be,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, AI itself is a scientific discipline which is improving all the time,\u201d Hassabis added. \u201cSo (it can) apply today\u2019s technologies directly to other fields, and (can) also continue to improve AI itself. And that as well is a sort of exponential improvement. So there\u2019s a lot of progress to be made in just the next few years,\u201d he continued.\n\nHassabis cited the example of Material Science \u2014 the study of new materials \u2014 which could be one of the fields to be impacted by AI. \u201cWe\u2019re touching on nearly every area of science. GNoME is one of my favourite projects which is on material design. And I think material design has some of the same characteristics that we look for in a problem that\u2019s suitable for AI. It\u2019s a massive combinatorial space. You need to try and build a model that understands the physics and the chemistry of the natural phenomena. And then if you have a model like that, you can then maybe use it to do a very efficient search through that search space, and then find an optimal solution. And in materials I think that would be groundbreaking \u2014 you could imagine designing new batteries, or maybe one day discovering a room temperature superconductor has always been one of my dreams,\u201d he added.\n\nHassbis should know a thing or two about science \u2014 he was awarded the Nobel Prize this year in Chemistry for working on an AI model that helps determine the structure of proteins. He seemed to be suggesting that much of scientific progress today remains stuck in silos \u2014 the best minds in physics, for instance, don\u2019t necessarily regularly speak to the best minds in biology to figure out how their respective research could be related. But if we manage to create a powerful enough AI that\u2019s smart enough as Nobel Prize winners in all fields, it could combine the different knowledge bases in interesting and unique ways to create new discoveries. And given how fast AI is improving \u2014 NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang says that AI is growing much faster than Moore\u2019s law \u2014 a new age of discovery in science and technology could be just around the corner."

            "article_content": "Home Sellers, 'Start Cutting Prices Or It's Going To Be A Long Winter,' Says Reventure CEO\n\nThe housing market continues its downturn as mortgage applications hit their lowest levels in three decades, according to data issued by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).\n\nNick Gerli, CEO of Reventure Consulting, pointed to the reality on X, formerly Twitter, noting that current mortgage demand has fallen about 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. For sellers, the latest figures are a bad sign as they head into winter, with purchase applications down 49.7% from 2019 levels and 55.2% below 2020 numbers.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe downturn continues despite favorable conditions that typically boost market activity. Despite two Federal Reserve rate cuts \u2013 one in September and another in early November \u2013 and the election\u2019s conclusion, buyers remain hesitant to enter the market.\n\nBehind the reluctance is historically poor homebuyer sentiment. The University of Michigan Sentiment Survey data showed that most Americans \"believe that high interest rates are weighing down homebuying conditions.\"\n\nAccording to Gerli, the core issue centers on housing prices. Current home valuations have reached unsustainable levels relative to inflation and income, exceeding the 2006 housing bubble peaks when adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n\nThe disconnect between perceived value and listing prices drives potential buyers away.\n\n\u201cSo buyers look for a home they think should be $350,000. And it costs $500,000,\u201d Gerli said. \u201cAnd they immediately give up. Because they know the home isn\u2019t worth that amount.\u201d\n\nSee Also: Invest in $20+ trillion home equity market today across cities like Austin, Miami, and Los Angeles through a unique 5-year term fund targeting a 14-20% IRR with minimums as low as $2,500\n\nRecent MBA data supports Gerli's assessment. While overall mortgage application volume showed a minimal 0.5% increase last week \u2013 the first rise in seven weeks \u2013 the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 6.86%, up from 6.81%. Refinancing applications dropped 2% to their lowest point since May despite being 43% higher than the previous year.\n\nJoel Kan, MBA\u2019s deputy chief economist, notes some bright spots in specific market segments. Applications for FHA and VA loans showed respective increases of 3% and 9%, with FHA rates notably declining against the broader trend.\n\nThe regional nature of the housing market means some areas may fare better than others. Gerli noted the variations in price forecasts for 2025, particularly between markets like Florida and New York.\n\nFor sellers hoping to move properties this winter, the message appears clear \u2013 price adjustments may be necessary to attract buyers in the current market environment.\n\n\n\nMarket dynamics suggest a shift in buyer behavior outside of typical seasonal slowdowns, pointing to deeper structural challenges in the housing market that might require price corrections to resolve.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Home Sellers, 'Start Cutting Prices Or It's Going To Be A Long Winter,' Says Reventure CEO originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

            "article_content": "On October 21, a new ticker opened to Nasdaq traders: NBIS, a truncation of Nebius, a fledgling player in the AI cloud infrastructure space.\n\nCasual observers could be forgiven for wondering where this company had come from, as there had been little in the way of the usual fanfare that surrounds most startups\u2019 journey to IPO \u2014 no roadshows; no horn tootin\u2019; no confetti-laden ceremonies; nothing, not a peep. That\u2019s because Nebius is an unusual beast: a public company, but a startup in just about every sense of the word.\n\nNebius has actually been public for 13 years, floating in May 2011 as Yandex N.V. \u2014 the Dutch holding company of Russian internet giant Yandex (often dubbed the \u201cGoogle of Russia\u201d). At the tail end of 2021, Yandex N.V. hit a peak valuation of $31 billion, but in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, everything changed. Nasdaq halted trading in Yandex N.V. shares that February due to sanctions imposed on Russian-affiliated companies, and a year later Nasdaq said it would delist Yandex altogether. But Yandex successfully appealed on the basis that it was restructuring \u2014 a process that would take an additional 16 months to fully complete.\n\nPart of this included offloading all its Russian assets, which was where most of the real business value lay. What remained under Yandex N.V.\u2019s ownership was a random assortment of infrastructure and business units that just happened to be located outside of Russia. This divestment concluded in July, with Yandex N.V. changing its name to Nebius AI, an AI cloud platform replete with its own Finnish data center.\n\nThe new business was to be spearheaded by Arkady Volozh (pictured above), the Russian Yandex co-founder and former CEO who was removed from a European sanctions list in March after he publicly condemned Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine.\n\nThe core Nebius business sells GPUs (graphical processing units) \u201cas-a-service\u201d to companies needing \u201ccompute\u201d \u2014 that is, processing power and resources to carry out computational tasks such as running algorithms and executing machine learning models. Last month, the company debuted a holistic cloud computing platform designed for the \u201cfull machine learning lifecycle,\u201d spanning data processing, training, fine-tuning, and inference.\n\nWith the restructuring complete, and Volozh free to run the show from the company\u2019s new HQ in the Netherlands, Nasdaq green-lighted Nebius to recommence trading last month. The situation was pretty much unprecedented, though: a public company whose trading was put on pause, only to resume nearly three years later under a new name and entirely different business proposition?\n\nIn many ways, it would\u2019ve made sense to have delisted and grown with private capital, the good old-fashioned startup way. But as Volozh explained to TechCrunch earlier this year, building infrastructure is capital intensive, and the easiest and cheapest way to access capital in what is currently one of the hottest spaces in tech is via the public markets. But there was never any certainty on how the public markets would respond to this strange new entity. Nobody really knew what to expect.\n\nA month in, and Nebius has enjoyed a somewhat tepid re-entry to public life; it\u2019s significantly down on its $18 billion market cap before trading halted in February 2022, which was to be expected, and it has since yo-yoed between $3.5 billion and $4.75 billion, with some signs that it is starting to settle.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t predict what would happen, it could be $5 per share, or it could be $50 per share \u2014 this has never happened before, nobody really knows how to treat it,\u201d Volozh told TechCrunch in an interview in London this month. \u201cIt\u2019s still volatile, but it\u2019s stabilizing, and the good thing is that it has stabilized above the cost of the assets, which means that the market believes we will be able to build a business here. How big a business, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nNebius competes with all the usual hyperscaler cloud behemoths, though arguably its more direct rivals are other alternative cloud startups such as CoreWeave, which has raised a ton of cash this year. With CoreWeave in the midst of expanding from the U.S. into Europe, Nebius is moving in the other direction, announcing plans this week to extend its presence to the U.S. with a new GPU cluster in Kansas City (on the Missouri side) scheduled to go live in early 2025. The company has also opened \u201ccustomer hubs\u201d in San Francisco and Dallas, with plans for a third in New York by the end of the year.\n\nBut while the cloud infrastructure business is its bread and butter (accounting for two-thirds of its revenue, as per its first earnings report last month), there\u2019s a triumvirate of additional businesses under the Nebius Group umbrella. This includes an autonomous vehicle company called Avride, based in Texas; a Swiss-based generative AI and LLM company called Toloka; and edtech platform TripleTen, located in Wyoming.\n\nDrive time\n\nAvride descends from the international division of Yandex\u2019s self-driving unit, which spun out of a joint venture with Uber in 2020. While Alphabet\u2019s Waymo is now leading the way in the burgeoning robotaxi realm, recently securing a $45 billion valuation, Yandex was an early trailblazer in Russia, with Volozh noting that the company had been on the cusp of beating Waymo to launch the first fully autonomous cars on public roads, before the war put the kibosh on plans.\n\n\u201cThey [Yandex] were set to launch the first taxis on public roads with nobody at the wheel, in a real city (Moscow), several months before Waymo launched in San Francisco,\u201d Volozh said. \u201cJournalists were invited to a big event in March, \u201922, but that launch never happened. People had to pack all their things and go in a matter of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe team that had been working on Yandex\u2019s autonomous vehicle project transitioned over to Avride, a new brand it launched last year, eventually moving to Austin via Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cThis is the same 250 people,\u201d Volozh added.\n\nLast month, Avride announced a significant multiyear partnership with Uber, which saw Avride\u2019s sidewalk food delivery robots land on Uber Eats starting in Austin, though the partnership will also bring Avride\u2019s self-driving cars to the Uber platform later (Uber has signed other similar deals, including with Google\u2019s sibling company Waymo).\n\nImage Credits:Avride\n\nWhile Yandex had sufficiently deep pockets to fund autonomous vehicle projects, Nebius doesn\u2019t \u2014 it has a couple billion dollars in the bank from its Russian divestment, and it\u2019s laser-focused on building its cloud infrastructure business. And this is why Volozh says that Avride will need to find additional partners in the longer term.\n\n\u201cThey have enough budget for this year and next year,\u201d Volozh said. \u201cWe\u2019re financing them, but they need to use this time to find new partners, because it\u2019s very capital intensive to build fleets. It needs real investment.\u201d\n\nObvious partners might include car manufacturers, but it could be any entity that\u2019s ready to invest billions, with Volozh adding that it would be willing to give up control in Avride if needed.\n\nToloka, meanwhile, is a platform that specializes in data labeling and quality control for large language models (LLMs) and related AI systems \u2014 it\u2019s much like Scale AI, which was most recently valued at more than $13 billion. Toloka has clear synergies with Nebius\u2019s core infrastructure business, but the customers aren\u2019t the same. Nebius works largely with generative AI startups seeking compute, whereas Toloka works with bigger companies such as Amazon and Hugging Face that want to improve their LLMs.\n\nBoth Toloka and Avride could eventually follow a similar path to that of ClickHouse, creators of the eponymous open source database management system that spun out of Yandex in 2021. While the commercial ClickHouse entity secured big-name backers such as Index Ventures, Benchmark Capital, and Coatue, Nebius has retained a minority stake.\n\n\u201cClickHouse became very popular, and we were approached by investment funds to create a business around the open source project. Now they have revenues, and they\u2019re growing,\u201d Volozh said.\n\nTripleTen, on the other hand, is something of an outlier in the Nebius group of businesses, in that it\u2019s pretty much a direct-to-consumer product that offers online coding bootcamps for those wishing to transition into the technology sector. One idea Nebius is dabbling with is to position itself as a provider of a \u201cfull stack of services\u201d to AI companies, from data centers and GPU infrastructure, to education. And this highlights the situation that Nebius has found itself in: It\u2019s drawing lines between the different entities it has been left with, and trying to make it all make sense.\n\nFor now, TripleTen is breaking even, and Volozh acknowledges that it\u2019s not going to be the big revenue driver that its infrastructure business is \u2014 but it has the potential to provide meaningful income and will remain part of the Nebius Group.\n\n\u201cNebius is a billion-dollar scale business,\u201d Volozh said. \u201cTripleTen \u2014 it\u2019s a nice model, but it\u2019s maybe a tens or hundreds-of-millions of dollars business. It\u2019s not a billion-dollar business.\u201d\n\nParallel compute\n\nAs for the core Nebius AI cloud business, the company already has its fully owned data center facility in Finland, with plans to triple its capacity to 75 megawatts. In tandem, the company is building out additional sites at co-location facilities, a move designed to not only increase its capacity, but also to reduce latency by bringing the processing closer to its customers. In addition to the Kansas location announced this week, Nebius had already unveiled a new GPU cluster in Paris that goes online this month.\n\nFurther down the line, Nebius plans to build more of its own data centers, both in Europe and the U.S., but given the time it takes, it\u2019s quicker to plug the gap with co-location facilities, which is why it\u2019s forging ahead with a hybrid approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more efficient if we build it ourselves, but to build means a year and a half or two years \u2014 it\u2019s a long process, and we can\u2019t wait,\u201d Volozh said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have these co-locations in Paris and Kansas City.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Apple stamped its entry into the AI era this year with the release of Apple Intelligence. But 2024 also marked the year when Apple\u2019s staggered release plan for feature updates was also slower than usual. 2025 might not be much different.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple has pushed an unspecified number of features that were otherwise supposed to arrive with the iOS 19 update next year. Earlier this week, the outlet also reported that a planned Siri upgrade that would give it more conversational chops has been delayed until Spring 2026.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told that a larger-than-usual number of features scheduled for iOS 19 (beyond the new Siri) are already postponed until spring 2026 (when iOS 19.4 debuts),\u201d says the Bloomberg report. The theme isn\u2019t too different from what Apple has followed so far with iOS 18.\n\nMerely weeks after the WWDC 2024 conference in June, it was reported that the company had delayed some of the most promising Siri and Apple Intelligence features. Some of those features, including the promised integration with third-party apps, are yet to arrive and are expected to roll out publicly next year.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, a senior Apple executive hinted that the company is taking a cautiously slow approach to releasing new features in the Apple Intelligence stack.\n\n\u201cYou could put something out there and have it be sort of a mess. Apple\u2019s point of view is more like, \u2018Let\u2019s try to get each piece right and release it when it\u2019s ready,\u2019\u201d SVP of Software Engineering at Apple, Craig Federighi, told the outlet.\n\nNow, Apple Intelligence hasn\u2019t quite run into the same kind of problems as rival products like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Gemini, or Microsoft\u2019s Copilot. Generative tools like those mentioned above already have their own set of inherent problems, such as hallucinations, blatantly making up inaccurate facts, and going haywire.\n\nIn his experiment with Google\u2019s Pixel Studio app, Digital Trends\u2019 Joe Maring witnessed the app generating deeply problematic images, such as a Nazi-influenced SpongeBob. My own experience with products like Gemini and ChatGPT has mostly varied between \u201cmeh\u201d and \u201claughably bad.\u201d\n\nThis well-documented error-prone nature of Generative AI products might also explain why Apple has been on the fence about going all-in with AI stuffing into its software. Unsurprisingly, Apple Intelligence has mostly stuck with low-stakes scenarios, instead of chasing ambitious goalposts with a high-risk, high-rewards caveat.\n\nAt the same time, Apple also risks lagging behind the competition. The likes of Google and Microsoft have already integrated their respective AI tools at the heart of popular products like Workspace and Office 365, alongside OS-level integrations here and there.\n\nWe are still over half a year away from getting a taste of what Apple has planned for iOS 19. Moreover, multiple iOS 18 features that were showcased months ago at Apple\u2019s annual developers conference are still in line for a public release.\n\nLooking over at the competition, Google is now planning to showcase its own big innovations in roughly the same time frame as Apple. The company has already released the first Developer Preview of Android 16, and aims to reach platform stability in the first half of the year.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Google aims to spoil Apple\u2019s glitzy June event covering yearly software updates, or so assures the search giant. However, with Apple\u2019s feature cadence reportedly running into delays, Google has a chance to wow smartphone enthusiasts with new software tricks ahead of Apple."
