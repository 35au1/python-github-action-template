Announced on November 25, Teleport by Varjo is a mobile app that uses AI to construct high-resolution 3D scans without specialized equipment. The company claims the app is the first to allow the VR scanning with just a smartphone.\n\nThe Teleport app uses generative AI built with NVIDIA GPUs to create virtual reality content from a smartphone. In an interview with Digital Camera World, the company explained that the app uses AI to create a representation from a series of images. The app doesn\u2019t require LiDAR, but iPhones with the technology can use it for enhanced results, Varjo noted.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app walks users through scanning a location, creating 3D scenes that can then be viewed on a computer, smartphone, or with a virtual reality headset. At launch, the app is available for iPhone and iPad and requires iOS 17 or later.\n\nUnlike Apple\u2019s spatial video, the Teleport photos shared by Varjo allow viewers to move within the space, looking between objects and taking in the room from different viewing angles. Spatial video, on the other hand, captures some depth but leaves the viewer \u201cstanding\u201d in the same spot.\n\nAccording to Varjo, scanning a scene in 3D took around five to ten minutes in beta testing. The company says that 2,000 professionals helped test the beta version of the Teleport app, creating a library of online Teleport scans. The app both reduces the time and complexity involved with full 3D captures, Varjo says, with commercial uses like construction, inspection or training as well as personal applications like saving a view of your wedding venue to relive in VR later.\n\nThe scans also allow for measuring the space from the 3D scans, including a rescaling tool for more accurate measurements. The company notes the measuring option isn\u2019t designed for high-precision engineering, but can prove helpful for applications like design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the app aims to create a lower entry into the field of VR and 3D scans, the Teleport app requires a subscription that starts at $30 / \u20ac24 / AU$ 46. Still, the cost is significantly lower than the price of pro-grade 3D VR cameras, or the cost of Canon\u2019s unique dual optics for the R mount. The app, however, is designed for scanning places, where VR cameras can also capture 3D video.\n\nWhile pro-grade VR 3D equipment isn\u2019t new, the growth of the technology has arguably been slow, as the VR headsets that deliver the most full experience are far from as widespread as smartphones and laptops. The high cost of the cameras required for such scans also likely played a role, which means a lower entry point like the Telephoto app could potentially spark some growth.\n\nNot a fan of AI?

            "article_content": "Google, Apple, Samsung, and practically every other big tech firm are promising a future where AI will take over your phone and computer. However, as it currently stands, newfangled AI assistants aren\u2019t as intelligent as their name suggests. Anthropic\u2014the makers of the Claude chatbot\u2014has a new tool that promises to give any assistant access to any app. If the future truly is based on \u201cagentic AI,\u201d then this model may be the way that Apple Intelligence or Gemini will collect the data from any of your devices\u2019 apps.\n\nThe tool is called the Model Context Protocol, which Anthropic said on Monday it was making open source and free to use for any developer. This protocol will create an information channel between a data source, even app data, and an AI assistant. This is designed for use by AI agents like Anthropic\u2019s Claude desktop app. Anthropic said this connection is \u201csecure,\u201d since\u2014instead of exposing their app\u2019s data\u2014third-party developers can instead build a \u201cMCP client,\u201d AKA a separate AI application, to connect to their private servers.\n\nWhile this ostensibly could be used by companies to allow any AI to access internal data more easily, it may also offer a new standard for how apps offer up their prized data to AI assistants. So far, AI apps like Google\u2019s Gemini on both Android and iOS can access the tech giant\u2019s own Workspace apps, so long as users give it permission. This means it can dig through your Gmail to surface some lost missives or turn any text reservations into an event on Google Calendar. Currently, Gemini doesn\u2019t have access to third-party apps except through extensions.\n\nAnthropic head of Claude relations, Alex Albert, claimed that developers would normally have to work directly with Google or any other AI assistant developer to create a custom connection between the AI and its data. MCP proclaims it solves that issue by enabling a free protocol that could work between the AI assistant and any app or data source.\n\nAlbert demoed Claude working directly with GitHub to make a new repository using MCP. He claimed that with MCP, it took \u201cless than an hour\u201d to build the AI-to-app integration. The company shared some repositories of sample MCP servers that it claims should help developers get started.\n\nHere's a quick demo using the Claude desktop app, where we've configured MCP: Watch Claude connect directly to GitHub, create a new repo, and make a PR through a simple MCP integration. Once MCP was set up in Claude desktop, building this integration took less than an hour. pic.twitter.com/xseX89Z2PD \u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) November 25, 2024\n\nWhile the protocol is open source, Anthropic still promoted how the most recent Claude 3.5 Sonnet model was better for creating these data channels between servers and the AI. Otherwise, Anthropic said this tool will replace today\u2019s \u201cfragmented\u201d integrations with something more \u201csustainable.\u201d So far, Anthropic said coding software companies Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have onboarded MCP for its AI integrations.\n\nApple has promised similar cross-app AI functionality for Apple Intelligence, eventually. That feature, alongside a rejuvenated Siri, could arrive in early spring next year. The Cupertino, California company\u2019s famously secure walled garden may not have a place for MCP, but other, smaller AI agent developers may be eyeing this or any other similar protocol.\n\nEither way, the major AI developers will be putting pressure on app makers to incorporate ways for AI assistants to access app data. While Apple claims its private cloud compute will keep all your personal data safe, we\u2019ll have to see if any of this open-handed data transfer proves yet another privacy SNAFU."

The CEO of the AI companion app Replika has said that most of the app's users are over 35 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Schmidt believes young men are particularly vulnerable, partly because they're not as educated as women on average. A 2024 Pew Research Study found US women outpaced men in college completion.\n\nSchmidt said that in extreme cases, younger men can \"turn to the online world for enjoyment and sustenance, but also because of the social media algorithms, they find like-minded people who ultimately radicalize them.\"\n\nThe former Google exec also said he's \"particularly concerned\" about the impact of technology on the human psyche when users are isolated and computers feed them information that's not necessarily centered on human values, a topic he wrote about in his latest book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people are becoming increasingly concerned about the harmful effects AI chatbots can have. A mother sued the chatbot startup Character.AI in October after her 14-year-old son committed suicide. The teenager had exchanged sexual messages with the chatbot, which told him to \"come home\" before he killed himself, the boy's mother said in the civil suit.\n\nSchmidt said parents need to be more involved, but they can only control what their children are doing to a certain extent. Although there are \"all sorts of rules about age\" for online platforms, Schmidt said they aren't doing enough to prevent teenagers from accessing harmful content.\n\n\"You put a 12- or 13-year-old in front of these things, and they have access to every evil as well as every good in the world,\" Schmidt said. \"And they're not ready to take it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchmidt has invested in various AI startups since leaving Google, and he's said that regulation of the technology shouldn't stifle innovation.\n\nIn his interview with Galloway, he said that US laws such as Section 230, which largely frees tech companies from being held legally responsible for the content users post to their platforms, should be amended \"to allow for liability in the worst possible cases, so when someone is harmed from this technology, we need to have a solution to prevent further harm.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick for FTC chair, Brendan Carr, has pushed for limitations to Section 230.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchmidt said he doesn't expect much AI regulation to happen over the next four years as Trump's administration will likely have other priorities. He also said that because tech companies have battalions of lawyers protecting their intellectual property and goals, \"it's likely to take some kind of a calamity to cause a change in regulation.\""

            "article_content": "Just in time for the much-anticipated 2024 edition of Art Basel Miami Beach, the fair has unveiled an A.I.-powered app developed in partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). The app aims to elevate the fair experience, offering visitors a more interactive and personalized journey through its sometimes overwhelming aisles of contemporary art.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. See all of our newsletters\n\nThis sophisticated new suite of features includes the Art Basel Companion and the Art Basel Lens, marking the first application of Microsoft\u2019s A.I. computer vision technology at a global art fair. Visitors will be able to scan artworks to get instant information about the pieces, the artists and the galleries showcasing them, and the app will additionally connect to their social networks so they can share their thoughts, impressions and hot takes as they browse. It\u2019s a step into the future of storytelling\u2014one that potentially expands the possibilities of user-generated content for the mega-fair.\n\nWhile a slew of startups have mostly fizzled out in their efforts to integrate data analysis, A.I. tools and real-time user feedback into art fairs and gallery visits, this partnership between two giants of their respective industries promises to squash any remaining competition. One streamlined platform will cover it all, according to the fair: transparency, interactivity and access to art\u2014at the Art Basel fairs, that is.\n\nThis artificially intelligent art fair companion will launch as a pilot in Art Basel Miami Beach\u2019s Nova and Survey sectors, which are the fair\u2019s hotspots of ultra-contemporary art and historical presentation, respectively. The goal? To make it easier for collectors to discover new voices and delve into museum-quality research presentations with a digital nudge in the right direction.\n\nWhen Observer asked how the app would improve the experience of the fair for visitors and how, at the same time, it could support galleries, Art Basel CEO Noah Horowitz said Art Basel Lens would let people on both sides navigate the fairs and shows across the associated cities in a much more dynamic, intuitive, and interactive way. \u201cIt is aligned with our efforts to continuously enhance the experience for established collectors and regular fairgoers, but also to create entry points for audiences who may be new to our platform,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s also about creating more opportunities to elevate our galleries and their artists and helping them reach untapped audiences.\u201d\n\nThe new app also includes personalized itinerary planning and Calendar Sync\u2014features that will let users RSVP to Art Basel events with the app and sync them with to their personal calendars. It also aims to simplify the exploration of partner benefits and offers during the show, making the whole experience a little more fluid.\n\n\u201cOur partnership is not just about technology,\u201d Microsoft VP Steve Clayton added. \u201cIt\u2019s about unlocking opportunities for deeper connections with artists and galleries\u2014and providing unique insights and discoveries for attendees.\u201d"

Witnesses have described him as about seven years old, dressed in scorched rags, and bearing burn marks\u2014features that suggest he is no ordinary child. He is, they claim, a ghost.\n\nCaroline McKendrick, lead investigator at Somerset Paranormal Investigators UK (SPI UK), a group that has been probing paranormal phenomena since 2012, says that reports of the boy often coincide with unexplained events. \u201cSeveral objects were mysteriously knocked off the kitchen counter, and the dishwasher switched on by itself, even when no one was nearby,\u201d McKendrick says. For years, staff and guests alike have reported strange occurrences: whispers in empty rooms, objects moving on their own, and other ghostly figures, including a domineering man and a woman who frequents Room No. 6.\n\nThese accounts, along with a local urban legend about the Inn\u2019s haunted past, convinced the six members of SPI UK to investigate. Tucked away in the small village of Somerset in southwest England, the Sparkford Inn dates back to the late Middle Ages. Over the centuries, it has served as a stopover for horse-drawn coaches, a popular lodging place for visitors, and a meeting point for local hunters. Today, it\u2019s a cozy hotel and pub. McKendrick and company arrived here with the goal of not only cataloging these apparitions, but proving they\u2019re full-bodied spirits, which are interactive entities that can produce physical effects and respond to human contact.\n\nFor the investigators, the stakes are high. The popularity of shows like Ghost Hunters and Paranormal Witness have fueled a fascination with the supernatural. But for SPI UK, it\u2019s more than a trend, it\u2019s a pursuit for real answers. Tracking down the elusive ghosts at the Sparkford Inn will put their skills and equipment to the test. Capturing tangible evidence of the paranormal would be a major breakthrough, advancing ghost hunting as a legitimate field of study\u2014far beyond mere entertainment or pseudoscience.\n\nFollowing McKendrick through the Inn\u2019s dimly lit corridors, the investigators are carrying large cases of technical equipment. Their toolkit includes electromagnetic field meters (EFMs) and thermal imaging cameras. While none of the team members are formally trained scientists, they bring many years of hands-on experience to their investigations, approaching cases with what they consider to be scientific rigor. Paranormal investigations, they say, follow a structured process that includes on-site visits, interviews with witnesses, and data collection. Afterward, the team analyzes the data for patterns and anomalies, like reviewing audio recordings for electronic voice phenomena.\n\nAlamy\n\nTo investigate the boy spirit, the team relies on their tried-and-tested methods, tuning their approach to encourage communication. They\u2019ve brought a teddy bear, play balls, and a toy clock to lure the young boy ghost into contact.\n\n\u201cYou communicate with the child\u2019s spirit the way you would with living children,\u201d says Donna Lalla, a paranormal investigator on the SPI UK team. Lalla is cordial and soft-spoken with short silver-gray hair and glasses. She tries to bring a nurturing energy to the team, especially for investigations involving children. \u201cYou encourage play, you start a nursery rhyme. You start singing \u201cRing-Around-the Rosie\u201d and wait for the young ghost to pick up the rhyme,\u201d Lalla continues. She begins to hum the tune, hoping the young ghost joins in.\n\nEveryone waits.\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\nDespite their best efforts, the team has yet to find convincing proof of a ghost. They partly blame their equipment, which is powerful, but not exactly designed for paranormal investigations. Electromagnetic Field detectors (EMFs), for example, detect electrical-wiring issues in the workplace or at home, and thermal-imaging cameras identify heat signatures in construction and firefighting. Still, the investigators persist, optimizing the tools they have, hungry for a breakthrough.\n\nThe idea of a realm between life and death\u2014where spirits linger and interact with the living\u2014has fascinated humankind across cultures and centuries. This belief in ghosts, spirits, and the supernatural has deep roots in ancient cultures, with references found in Egyptian tomb texts, Greek epics like The Odyssey, and early Chinese ghost stories.\n\nIn 1882, paranormal investigations took on more scientific undertones when a group of scholars and intellectuals, from physicists to journalists, founded The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London, the first organization dedicated to the scientific study of paranormal and supernatural phenomena. The SPR aimed to apply scientific methods and principles to the study of paranormal and supernatural phenomena, covering telepathy, mediumship, and apparitions.\n\nThen the American Society for Psychical Research emerged in 1884 when physicist Sir William Barrett persuaded authoritative scientific figures and intellectuals\u2014such as the Scottish-born American inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, and William James, the father of American psychology\u2014that it was vital to apply the scientific method to psychical phenomena. James himself dove headfirst into investigating mediums, attending s\u00e9ances. His aim was twofold and conflicting by today\u2019s standards: to understand the depths of human consciousness and to explore the possibility that consciousness might transcend the physical body, potentially explaining life after death itself.\n\nAs these groups evolved, so did the tools they employed. Early ghost hunters relied primarily on observational methods and interviews . They would conduct s\u00e9ances, monitor mediums, and document irregular phenomena in detail\u2014for example table movements or unexplained sounds during s\u00e9ances. As technology advanced, investigators began incorporating new instruments and adapting them to suit their needs.\n\n\u201cSpirits need tremendous amounts of energy to penetrate the sphere of the living,\u201d explains Lalla, adjusting an EMF meter as the team prepares for the night\u2019s investigation. Today, at the Sparkford Inn, the SPI UK team brings a range of these tools into the field. They hope their handheld EMF devices will detect spikes in electromagnetic energy, which they believe might signal the presence of spirits.\n\nStav Dimitropoulos\n\nA few moments later in the dimly lit corridor, Lalla scans the room with a thermal imaging camera, looking for heat signatures that might suggest an unaccounted presence. Nearby, another team member positions motion sensors near an antique rocking chair that, according to reports, has mysteriously moved in the past. The faint buzz of a Geiger counter fills the air, its needle steady but poised to detect any spikes in radiation\u2014a phenomenon some link to psychic activity.\n\nDigital voice recorders capture potential paranormal voices, while body cams ensure every moment is documented. One investigator monitors an environmental device, noting fluctuations in barometric pressure and humidity. \u201cIf a spirit manifests, it could subtly alter the immediate environment,\u201d she explains, pointing to the screen.\n\nBut these tools are only as effective as the investigators who wield them.\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\nThe feeble light from the hallway barely reaches the edges of Room No. 6 as the SPI UK team gathers around their equipment, their whispers blending with the creaks of the old floorboards. \u201cAsk her something specific,\u201d McKendrick says to Lalla, who is adjusting the settings on something called a spirit box. The device rapidly scans through radio frequencies, generating white noise that ghost hunters believe spirits can manipulate and communicate through. The spirit box crackles to life, its static filling the room as the investigators lean closer, straining to hear. Suddenly, a faint, almost imperceptible whisper cuts through the noise. The sound is fleeting, but it\u2019s enough to send a ripple of energy through the team.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d McKendrick asks, her voice a mixture of agony and elation. The team exchanges wide-eyed glances, the room suddenly electric with possibility.\n\nFor a moment, no one moves, ears straining for any follow-up. Lalla tilts her head toward the spirit box, her expression intent. \u201cWas that her?\u201d McKendrick finally murmurs. \u201cThe woman from Room No. 6?\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe team replays the recording, each straining to interpret the faint response. Could it have been a \u201cyes\u201d or a soft hum of agreement? The ambiguity only deepens the mystery.\n\nLater, McKendrick reflects on the moment with tempered excitement. \u201cWe caught a couple of incomprehensible voices in response to questions during callouts,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut they were more like uh huhs and mmms. If it had been clearer, I would have had the sound enhanced with an audio expert.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly did the team hear? Was it an eerie whisper from beyond or something more prosaic? The equipment ghostbusters rely on\u2014tools like spirit boxes and EMFs\u2014can pick up far more than just spirits. Static interference, stray radio signals, or even the voices of nearby people can all masquerade as spectral activity.\n\nSkeptics like Christopher French, a British psychologist and head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London, argue that such tools often mislead investigators. \u201cTo check whether allegedly paranormal phenomena are occurring, it\u2019s crucial to consider all possible explanations,\u201d French says. He suggests that whispers like those heard at the Sparkford Inn might simply be quiet noises from living people nearby, misinterpreted as ghostly communication, or random background noise amplified by eager imaginations.\n\nFrench also highlights a broader issue: the lack of rigorous data collection across time, which he argues is essential for true investigations of the unknown. Without such scientific scrutiny, the accuracy of instruments in paranormal use cases remain dubious.\n\n\u201cThese people want to give the appearance that they are doing science, but they really aren\u2019t,\u201d French says. \u201cTo check whether allegedly haunted locations have unusual patterns of electromagnetic activity, for example, you need to collect vast amounts of data in three dimensions across time. Without such scientific appraisal, the accuracy of instruments in paranormal use cases remains highly questionable. \u201cThose phantom outlines appearing on your thermal camera are usually specks of dust,\u201d French says.\n\nIn the case of the voice on the team\u2019s spirit box, French also has a theory. \u201cMost probably they inadvertently recorded living people speaking to each other that they didn't realize were in the area. Or sometimes even random background noises,\u201d he says.\n\nGetty Images\n\nLalla, however, disagrees. \u201cI just sit in a dark room, waiting,\u201d she says, estimating that up to two-thirds of her investigations produce no evidence at all. But her team never forces results. Take the scene with the toys, for instance. The teddy bear remained untouched. The toy clock never ticked, and no giggle or playful knock ever broke the silence. The lull of waiting is both part of the challenge and the mystery of their work. Lalla hums a nursery rhyme, but the room stays eerily still\u2014a subtle reminder that the paranormal often chooses its own time to speak, if at all.\n\nFrench acknowledges that while some teams are sincere in their mission, others may embellish evidence for sensational results. For many, French adds, the appeal lies in the social aspect and the status of being a paranormal investigator just as much as the search for real evidence. Still, the allure of the unexplained keeps investigators returning to allegedly spirit-infested places, where the line between ordinary and extraordinary occasionally blurs.\n\nAbout six months after their March investigation, McKendrick and her husband, who is also on the SPI UK team, visited the Sparkford Inn once again and met the new assistant manager. She shared a peculiar incident from early September that left her quite distressed. She was near the pool table when, suddenly, a pool ball came flying toward her through the hatch in the bar area. Startled, the manager approached the players at the pool table, jokingly admonishing them to keep their balls on the table. But all of their balls were accounted for; it was a spare. To add to the enigma, no one was near the bar area at the time who could have thrown it.\n\nOn another day, several staff and patrons witnessed a two-liter bottle of vodka fall from the wine rack and shatter on the ground. SPI UK investigators argue that the sheer number and variety of bizarre occurrences reported at the Inn make it difficult to simply dismiss them as coincidences or explain them away with skepticism. They vow to return again, armed with more high-tech tools and unflinching determination.\n\nIf there is a passage linking the living and the deceased, these apparition chasers believe they have the patience\u2014and the technology\u2014to uncover it. In their world, the world of the paranormal, every creak of time-worn wood, every shadow\u2019s fleeting waltz slipping past the awareness of the casual observer might be a potential scientific breakthrough and a gateway to a story untold."

            "article_content": "Guillermo del Toro\u2019s paranormal experience watching \u2018The Wire\u2019 in a hotel room: \u201cCompletely inauspicious conditions\u201d\n\nIf there is any director in Hollywood who most people would expect to be a believer in the paranormal, it\u2019s Guillermo del Toro. After all, he has spent his career telling visually astonishing tales of monsters, demons, and the evils of man that echo through the ages. He\u2019s dealt directly with ghosts in two films, The Devil\u2019s Backbone and Crimson Peak. Amazingly, though, del Toro considers himself a sceptic despite revealing he once had a paranormal experience in a hotel room that would make even the most optimistic believer\u2019s blood run cold.\n\nWhen del Toro made The Devil\u2019s Backbone in 2001, he created a definition of a ghost that spoke to him deeply. In his story of a young boy in a Spanish orphanage being haunted by the ghost of a dead boy, he describes spirits as akin to an insect in amber or something left forever unfinished. As he told Little White Lies, a ghost is \u201can awful sealed thing\u2026like a photograph, like the loop of a movie.\u201d\n\nThe Nightmare Alley helmer subsequently revealed that, in his life, he\u2019d had two paranormal experiences despite being dubious about the existence of ghosts. In fact, despite being such a fan of the macabre and the monstrous in fiction, when it comes to real-life proof of terrifying forces beyond our comprehension, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe.\u201d Essentially, in fiction, del Toro is Fox Mulder, but in reality, he\u2019s Dana Scully.\n\nDespite this, del Toro couldn\u2019t explain away his experiences as some trick of the brain or the creaking of an old building. He claimed, \u201cTwo times I have heard ghostly, disembodied voices, very, very clearly. And they were very scary at the time.\u201d\n\nDel Toro\u2019s most bone-chilling experience came when he was scouting locations for The Hobbit in New Zealand \u2013 ironically, a film he wound up not making. He explained, \u201cWe came to\u2026 a place called Waitomo, and I had read that there was an old hotel which had a haunted room.\u201d Even though the director and his scouts had arrived during the tourist off-season and the hotel was closed, the management agreed to open it, especially for them. Feeling curious, del Toro asked, \u201cCan I get the haunted room?\u201d but he would soon regret that request.\n\nWhile del Toro sat in the room and idly watched The Wire on DVD, he heard something that made him turn white as a sheet. He revealed that the sound was unmistakable: \u201cA woman shrieking for about five minutes, horrible blood-curdling shrieks. And then a man sobbing and sighing with great regret.\u201d\n\nThe terrified director estimated that the screaming lasted for five minutes and the remorseful weeping a full ten minutes more. He did some sleuthing and figured out where the noises were coming from. He claimed, \u201cI was able to actually track the sounds to the bathroom. I tracked them to a vent above the toilet, which went down into the cellar.\u201d\n\nDel Toro was adamant that nothing about the evening had primed him to think he was encountering the spirit realm. He clarified, \u201cI was not in the middle of s\u00e9ance, and it wasn\u2019t a stormy night,\u201d and added, \u201cIt was completely inauspicious conditions for a ghost apparition.\u201d All he was doing was watching high-quality crime drama to wind down after a long day of looking at potential locations.\n\nNaturally, the experience freaked del Toro out. He admitted that as soon as he realised the noises were coming from the cellar, he quietly returned to bed and put on his headphones. All he wanted was to be completely enveloped in the sound of Baltimore\u2019s war on drugs instead of that awful, disembodied screaming. Unsurprisingly, he didn\u2019t sleep a wink for the entire night."

            "article_content": "Skysong\n\nC.A. Wright\n\nPantera Press, $32.99 Fairytale adapted into a full-length fantasy novel best describes C.A. Wright\u2019s Skysong. This book takes inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Nightingale \u2013 one of the brighter flights in that author\u2019s oeuvre, though still spiked with folly and mortality. We follow Oriane, who lives in a remote village with a mystical legacy inherited from her mother. She can transform into a skylark, with the power to call the sun each morning. Curiosity leads Oriane into the dangers and intrigues of the royal court, where she\u2019s worshipped as a goddess but effectively imprisoned in the role. Her maid, Andala, also has a secret and as a schism erupts in the kingdom, it transpires that our heroine is not alone as she thinks. Wright\u2019s tale takes the possessiveness and failure to appreciate beauty in Andersen\u2019s original, and the motif of deception leading to feminine freedom, and builds a fantasy world in which the magical bird becomes an unwitting pawn in a political and religious struggle.\n\nThe Dream of A Tree\n\nMaja Lunde, trans. Diane Oatley\n\nScribner, $34.99 The final book in Norwegian author Maja Lunde\u2019s Climate Quartet, The Dream of A Tree takes us to the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard in 2110, where the Global Seed Vault is kept. Cut off from the world for years, Tommy and his brothers and their grandmother, the current Seed Keeper, tread lightly and at one with nature in their isolated home. When their tiny community faces disaster, they are suddenly alone and fighting not just to survive but to preserve the wonders of the Vault. Meanwhile, Tao, still grieving a son lost to starvation in a distant land, must lead an expedition into the Arctic, searching for the seeds that might save her people from famine. I only recall having read Lunde\u2019s The History of Bees, so I\u2019m uncertain how the Climate Quartet hangs together. Still, the books are written to be read as standalones, and this bleak cli-fi survival story is more imaginative in describing Tao\u2019s expedition than the trials on Svalbard itself.\n\nNON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\n\nMean Streak\n\nRick Morton\n\n4th Estate, $35.99 When robo-debt was inflicted on Centrelink recipients by a ruthless coalition government, it was as though the infamous, automated debt calculation scheme was authored by Franz Kafka, in collaboration with George Orwell. In this searing, forensic and moving investigation of the whole tragic fiasco, Rick Morton, senior reporter with the Saturday Paper, calls it the \u201clabyrinth\u201d. For good reason. Seven people took their own lives, thousands lost their jobs and others developed mental illness. Morton, in measured writing fuelled with rage and sorrow in equal measure, walks us through one of the most shameful episodes in recent Australian politics, taking in prime ministers, pressured public servants, a whistleblower and case studies of the poor sods who were hunted down by their own government. A morality tale for our times.\n\nGreat Game On: The Contest for Central Asia and Global Supremacy\n\nGeoff Raby\n\nMUP, $34.99 In the original Great Game \u2013 a 19th-century imperial contest between Britain and Russia over India \u2013 the threat from Russia was more imagined than real, says Raby (our Chinese ambassador, 2007-2011). Likewise, the United States\u2019 fears of China and Vietnam. His examination of the new Great Game, prompted by his observations of the chaotic US departure from Afghanistan and Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, examines in lively detail the rise of China in Eurasia and its implications for the US, Russia and the world, while also putting events in detailed historical context. Has Putin demonstrated there is no such thing as a quick, decisive victory and will this affect China\u2019s options regarding Taiwan? Has he opened the way for China in Eurasia? Aimed at the general reader, this is a seriously informed study of the major players in these \u201cinteresting\u201d times.\n\nAustralian Ghost Stories\n\nJames Phelps\n\nHarper Collins, $15.99 Everybody loves a good ghost story and there are hauntings aplenty in this record of paranormal activity in Oz. Phelps bookends his collection with tales of the Hydro-Majestic Hotel in the Blue Mountains, especially the case of June Clemenger, who was strangled at the hotel in 1934 by an ex-lover, and who now stalks the place attempting retributive strangulation. Not only did Conan-Doyle conduct seances at the hotel, Sir Edmund Barton died there and has also been spotted floating around. In between, we hear believers\u2019 tales of a prison ghost watching black-and-white movies, families in haunted houses smelling phantom cigarette smoke, a Casper-like friendly ghost and ghost whisperers who have the happy knack of detecting the paranormal and \u201ccleansing\u201d the house of it. Get out the Ouija board, dim the lights, and get spooked."

            "article_content": "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the workforce and budget have reached an all-time high. Whether astonishing growth will continue depends on the actions of the Trump administration and Congress next year.\n\nIn the meantime, ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer said during his first State of the Lab address since joining the laboratory in 2023, that the laboratory\u2019s mission will be the same.\n\nOak Ridge National Laboratory Director Stephen Streiffer delivers his first State of the Lab address at the American Museum of Science and Energy. The talk was hosted by Friends of ORNL.\n\nIn his recent talk at the American Museum of Science and Energy and hosted by Friends of ORNL, hedescribed the lab's mission as increasing the nation\u2019s competitiveness, accelerating innovation and delivering scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs to solve problems in clean energy and global security, thus creating economic opportunity for the nation.\n\nHow ORNL has grown\n\nIn the past five years, he noted, ORNL has grown from 4,900 employees and a budget of $1.8 billion to 7,200 employees and a budget of $2.6 billion. National security funding grew the most, more than doubling its 2019 funding level. The budgeted amounts for the other areas \u2013 science, energy and partnerships \u2013 all increased.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGrowth is a good thing but has its downside as well,\u201d Streiffer said, noting that he is constantly being asked to provide more offices and parking spaces during a year in which more than $1 billion was spent on modernization, making ORNL a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d for modernization in the national U.S. Department of Energy complex.\n\nHe noted that ORNL is \u201ca real economic driver for the region\u201d because in the past year it spent $223 million on products and services provided by Tennessee businesses, including small businesses.\n\nWhen asked how he thinks science priorities might change under a new administration, he said that \u201cbasic science tends to do pretty well under Republican administrations\u201d and that \u201che suspects what we\u2019ll see is more of a rollback to a federal role for supporting basic science with more of an emphasis on industry doing the translation\u201d of national lab inventions to commercial products and services.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, he added, there had been a shift enabling DOE's national labs like ORNL to work with industry on demonstrating and deploying applied technologies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFiscal responsibility is important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that overall budgets will be lower under the incoming administration than they might have been if the election had gone a different way. Fortunately, what we do here at ORNL has huge support from our Republican congressional delegation and from the state political system.\u201d\n\nIn collaboration with Volkswagen, Oak Ridge National Laboratory broke a record by demonstrating high-speed wireless charging of an electric vehicle, energizing it with 270 kilowatts in 15 minutes. The specially equipped car was aligned with electromagnetic coils in a mat on which the car is parked.\n\nExperiments and projects\n\nHe noted the increasing frequency of million-dollar weather-related disasters, such as the regional flooding from Hurricane Helene.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you believe about climate change, the Earth is doing the experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like to use our computer models to be able to understand the potential impacts of extreme weather events,\u201d adding that ORNL is doing research on how to mitigate these impacts.\n\nHe spoke about the creation at ORNL of a 3D model of an area\u2019s soil and vegetation types, sewer systems and buildings to more accurately assess the dangers of flooding from extreme rainfall to its infrastructure and populations. He also mentioned research using robots, conveyor belts and inputs of water and fertilizer to identify which genetically altered plants have the traits that make them the most resilient to drought.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAn underappreciated achievement of the lab, Streiffer said, is its success in devising more sustainable and cost-effective building technologies that address the housing shortage crisis. In addition, researchers testing sensor-laden microgrids at ORNL\u2019s GRID-C facility are learning how to employ advanced power electronics to make the nation\u2019s electric grid more resilient and reliable during increased integration of renewable energy, greater demands from electric vehicles, extreme weather events and cybersecurity attacks.\n\nStreiffer noted another upcoming change: the Frontier supercomputer at ORNL will no longer be the fastest in the world. It will slip to second in the Top 500 ranking, passed up by a new supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The machine at Argonne National Laboratory (where Streiffer had worked as director of the Advanced Photon Source) rounds out the top three. (Editor's note: Since his talk, Frontier has indeed slipped to No. 2 behind El Capitain.)\n\nIn collaboration with Volkswagen, Oak Ridge National Laboratory broke a record by demonstrating high-speed wireless charging of an electric vehicle, energizing it with 270 kilowatts in 15 minutes. The specially equipped car was aligned with electromagnetic coils in a mat on which the car is parked.\n\nHe said the top three supercomputers in the world are DOE national laboratory machines. In addition, ORNL will be purchasing an even faster exascale supercomputer, called Discovery, that will be installed in 2027.\n\nStreiffer was also asked about the massive supercomputer that Elon Musk\u2019s xAI company is building in a former Electrolux factory in Memphis. Called Colossus, this supercomputer, which is expected to be one of the most powerful in the world, will be capable of training and running advanced artificial intelligence models including an AI chatbot. It will require large amounts of water and 120 megawatts of electricity Frontier operates on 25 megawatts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn answer to a question about Musk, Streiffer said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work with him,\u201d adding that the lab will likely be collaborating with industrial firms that are building more data centers with powerful supercomputers for AI purposes to help them make these machines more energy efficient.\n\nThe lab director noted that the new Center for AI Security Research at ORNL is scientifically analyzing vulnerabilities, threats and risks related to emerging and advanced artificial intelligence.\n\nA lot of takeaways from Streiffer's talk\n\nHere are some other takeaways from Streiffer\u2019s State of the Lab address.\n\nORNL, which receives most of its funding from DOE\u2019s Office of Science, has the nation\u2019s largest materials research portfolio and the nation\u2019s most diverse energy portfolio. ORNL has a world-class research reactor (High Flux Isotope Reactor) and the world\u2019s most intense neutron source (Spallation Neutron Source). The Proton Power Upgrade has increased SNS power by 40% so it is now operating at 1.7 megawatts, with 2.8 megawatts available for the future.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. office responsible for fabricating and delivering important components to the international ITER fusion facility being built in France is headquartered at ORNL. Streiffer said ORNL is working with private companies to more quickly advance fusion energy technologies, but he thinks that commercial fusion power in the United States is three decades away.\n\nORNL is building a Materials Plasma Exposure eXperiment (MPEX) to help scientists identify promising candidate materials for inner walls of vessels that will most likely hold up against the superhot fusion plasmas they contain.\n\nTo carry out its missions, ORNL has experts in materials science, neutron science, computing, quantum science and AI, nuclear physics, clean energy, fission and fusion, biology and environmental science, isotopes and national security. Its researchers have received 86 patents this past year, the most of all the DOE national laboratories. ORNL has eight user facilities and hosts more than 5,000 research guests each year.\n\nThe fast-growing national security area at ORNL focuses on nuclear nonproliferation (preventing the spread of weapons-grade nuclear materials internationally) and the development and use of computer technologies armed with AI tools to help government officials make quicker decisions to better defend and protect the nation.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORNL has used the Frontier supercomputer to simulate the operation of a nuclear reactor and will simulate changes in reactor behavior when a new nuclear fuel is used.\n\n\u201cWe can start to do computational experiments on an entire virtual reactor,\u201d Streiffer said, suggesting this capability might speed up licensing of advanced small modular reactors for future nuclear power plants.\n\nA materials science experimentalist, he predicted a new trend in science.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely certain that the experimentalist\u2019s role in the not-too-distant future will be to verify computational results, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA discovery by ORNL researchers of previously unknown properties of the lanthanide element promethium, which was discovered in 1945 at the lab\u2019s first reactor, was published in May in the prestigious journal Nature. ORNL measurements of the radioactive promethium\u2019s atom size and lengths of its chemical bonds in a compound improved understanding of lanthanide properties.\n\nStreiffer explained that the lab has been producing and selling radioisotopes not made in the American private sector because the United States decided to quit importing them from Russia after it invaded Crimea in 2014. In the past five years, he added, the number of shipments of radioisotopes produced at the High Flux Isotope Reactor increased from 355 to more than 800. ORNL is now constructing a new Stable Isotope Production and Research Center to help secure the U.S. stable isotope supply.\n\nORNL-produced isotopes have a wide variety of applications. Heat from the decay of plutonium 238 powers the Perseverance Rover on Mars. Nickel-63 is used to detect hidden explosives at airports; californium-252, to start up nuclear reactors; and thorium-228 and actinium-225, to image tumors and treat cancer.\n\nIn collaboration with Volkswagen, ORNL broke a record by demonstrating high-speed wireless charging of an electric vehicle, energizing it with 270 kilowatts in 15 minutes. The specially equipped car was aligned with electromagnetic coils in a mat on which the car is parked. Widespread use of this technology for faster charging of EVs, say, in EV owners\u2019 garages or public charging stations, could make EVs more attractive to potential consumers, Streiffer said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORNL and Argonne researchers have used neutron scattering at the Spallation Neutron Source and X-Ray scattering at the Advanced Photon Source to examine samples of amorphous materials \u2013 substances like glass that lack a clear structure, unlike crystalline materials \u2013 grown in the gravity-free environment of the International Space Station. Streiffer said the scientists found \u201creally interesting optical and mechanical properties that are related to the specific way that the amorphous structure forms\u201d under heating and melting in outer space.\n\nHe noted that the lab is reinvigorating its partnership with the University of Tennessee through the UT\u2013Oak Ridge Innovation Institute, which focuses on clean manufacturing, advanced materials, energy storage and radiopharmaceutical therapies.\n\nORNL researchers are working on making an ultrapure germanium-76 isotope that could detect a rare type of radioactive decay in an international experiment. If this process were observed, it would provide strong evidence that neutrinos, tiny neutral particles that rarely interact with matter, can become their own antiparticles. This discovery would revolutionize scientists\u2019 understanding of the universe and potentially explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe.\n\n\u201cWe are participating in an international high-energy physics collaboration involving 290 scientists, 55 institutions and 12 countries,\u201d Streiffer said. It is known as LEGEND-1000, he added, because the experiment design includes the use of 1,000 kilograms of the ultrapure germanium isotope that ORNL plans to produce for a deep underground laboratory, probably in Italy, that will shield neutrinos passing through from cosmic rays.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe would love to find some chink in the Standard Model of particle physics in the universe showing where it doesn\u2019t work and why a new theory is needed to explain how the universe is assembled and behaves,\u201d Streiffer remarked. \u201cThis could win a Nobel Prize!\u201d\n\nOak Ridge National Laboratory Director Stephen Streiffer delivers his first State of the Lab address at the American Museum of Science and Energy.

            "article_content": "2025 will be marked by the rise of AI as a standard tool, but with this advancement comes a new set of challenges.\n\nThe software development landscape is in for a seismic shift in 2025. This year will be marked by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) as a standard tool, but with this advancement comes a new set of challenges. DevPro Journal recently spoke with the team at Digital.ai to learn more and identify 13 key trends that could reshape your development experience in 2025.\n\nDan Shugrue, Application Security Product Marketing, Digital.ai:\n\nSmart Enterprises Will Move Beyond Vulnerability Scanning. As enterprises embrace AI tools to help them code faster, threat actors have worked in lockstep to write faster malware, analyze code, and get better at wreaking havoc. In 2025, smarter enterprises will harden their apps against reverse engineering through advanced obfuscation, anti-tamper, and threat monitoring. AI Tools Will Bleed into Security Teams. In 2025, expect security departments to adopt AI to keep up with the cybersecurity arms race. Early adopters will look to ML-assisted threat analytics to find patterns in attack behavior that better equip them to mitigate attacks.\n\nDerek Holt, CEO, Digital.ai:\n\nAI-based code assistants go from early adopter to standardized driving both positive and negative impacts. While 2023 and 2024 saw a lot of experimentation with coding co-pilots with expanded adoption in startup companies and various forward-leaning enterprises, 2025 will be marked as the year coding co-pilots become a standard. Like all new technology adoption, this will have pros and cons. Expect to see more code developed more quickly, but keep an eye out for challenges with re-use, quality, security, and technical debt. New bottlenecks emerge in software delivery. While AI-assisted development will drive increased code creation and ultimately drive individual developer productivity gains, new bottlenecks will quickly emerge across the broader software delivery lifecycle. Organizations that have not invested in test automation, built in security, release orchestration, code scanning and more will struggle to translate more productive developers into faster time to market. The Emergence of xOps. As more and more \u201ctraditional applications\u201d begin to adopt AI capabilities expect DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps to converge into xOps. This new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u201cAI-aware\u201d Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities. Software Engineering Intelligence steps into the spotlight (and quickly gains predictive AI capabilities). While Value Stream Management continued to lose steam in 2024, we also saw the fast emergence of Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) to take its place. SEI will have a breakout year in 2025 as more and more businesses realize they need to measure the end-to-end business process of software development and delivery in order to drive continuous improvement, truly deliver improved developer experiences and ultimately realize the potential gains for an AI-powered Software Development and Delivery capabilities. SEI is the key to each. Security and Change Risk Prediction Will Outperform Productivity Gains. As AI continues to impact the entire business process of planning, coding, building, testing, and delivering software, the importance of security and risk prediction will take another leap up the list of priorities. 2024 was marked by scale security breaches and huge change risk failures (let\u2019s not forget walking through airport terminals looking at the blue screen of death)\u2026..with AI driving more changes more quickly, enterprise businesses will continue to increase investment in security and risk prediction solutions.\n\nMike Woodard, VP of Product Management for Application Security, Digital.ai:\n\nThe AppSec Arms Race Will Heat Up. In 2025, If it wasn\u2019t obvious before, no one in application security can safely take a break. With the advantage of AI, reverse engineering and attack tools will become even more sophisticated. Threat actors will use these tools and techniques to better understand the operation of apps, uncover their secrets, and make malicious use of APIs. AI-Aided Threat Monitoring Will Become the Norm. SOC managers have the unenviable job of searching mountains of data for actionable information. AI-aided threat monitoring, such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and general classification of data, will become necessary for security teams to surface the most urgent threats so that proper mitigation steps can be taken in a timely manner.\n\nAdam Kentosh, Field CTO, Digital.ai:"
