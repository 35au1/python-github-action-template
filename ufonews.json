(File Image)\n\nSaif Ali Khan is a notable personality in the Bollywood industry, not only for his acting but also for his varied tastes and intellectual curiosity. Saif is a global-minded actor with royal ancestry whose passions go far beyond sets and scripts. He is also an avid reader and his taste in literature reflects his artistic endeavours. He still finds time to read a great book amid his busy schedule. Any bookworm would be jealous of his magnificent collection, stocked with first editions and signed copies. Saif has given us a look into his personality by sharing some of his favourite novels in his interviews. The books that influenced the actor\u2019s thought process offer an intriguing look into his mind. He suggests these three works since they each have a distinct storytelling and thought-provoking style. Let\u2019s have a look:\n\nThe Fountainhead by Ayn Rand\n\nrelated stories\n\nThe Fountainhead (1943) by Ayn Rand is a philosophical book that uses the tale of Howard Roark, a young, unyielding architect, to examine independence, creativity and integrity. Roark encounters obstacles and rejection as a result of his creative designs that defy social norms. Roark\u2019s independence is contrasted throughout the book with the moral compromising and conforming behaviour of characters such as Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey. Rand uses the story to support her objectivism, emphasising the pursuit of personal values and rational self-interest. The book is a thought-provoking examination of ambition, artistic independence and the conflict between personal vision and social expectations.\n\nSaif Ali Khan suggests this book because it emphasises the value of self-reliance and sticking to one\u2019s convictions, which he can connect to in his own life and work. In addition to telling a gripping tale, the book challenges readers to consider their morals and the cost of being authentic.\n\nThe Code of the Woosters by P.G. Wodehouse\n\nThe Code of the Woosters by P.G. Wodehouse, published in 1938, is a hilarious comedy romp that stars the endearingly incompetent Bertie Wooster and his unflappable butler, Jeeves. Bertie is drawn into a string of mishaps including a friend\u2019s romantic problems, an outrageous cow-creamer and an overbearing aunt. Wodehouse\u2019s trademark wit, complex plot turns and endearing characters such as the cunning Sir Roderick Spode and the unfortunate Gussie Fink-Nottle abound in this tale. One of Wodehouse\u2019s best-known works, the novel is a masterwork of absurd humour that captures the whimsical mayhem of upper-class British society.\n\nSaif has a strong taste for British wit and Wodehouse\u2019s light-hearted narrative is expertly displayed in this novel. He adores how it provides a lovely diversion from daily life, full of witty banter and humorous scenarios.\n\nCollected Ghost Stories by M.R. James\n\nSome of the best ghostly stories ever written are collected in M.R. James\u2019s Collected Ghost Stories, demonstrating his command of atmosphere, tension and fear. These tales, which were written between 1895 and 1936, frequently centre on scholars or antiquarians who unintentionally awaken evil spirits. James creates a spooky realism with his use of rich historical information and subtle danger. These classic stories continue to enthral readers with their subdued, eerie intensity and have influenced countless horror authors.\n\nSaif Ali Khan is enthralled by James\u2019 use of suspense and tension, choosing psychological terror over the gory violence frequently found in contemporary films. This suggestion demonstrates Saif\u2019s wide range of literary preferences by fusing his passion for books with an interest in the enigmatic. Collected Ghost Stories is a great option if you\u2019re searching for a terrifying dive into the paranormal; it provides a spooky experience without resorting to graphic graphics.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nSaif Ali Khan\u2019s reading list portrays a man who refuses to be constrained by the glamour of his career to better comprehend the world and himself. One can\u2019t help but wonder which book will influence his decisions or give him a fresh perspective on life as he continues to wow audiences with his amazing movies. His bookshelf serves as a map of a different vision as well as a collection of volumes for readers and fans like us.\n\nFirst Published: January 17, 2025, 13:05 IST"

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

            "article_content": "ChatGPT is OpenAI's extremely useful chatbot for answering questions. Here's how to use the generative AI tool in Apple's Notes app in macOS.\n\nApple Intelligence is now integrated with OpenAi's ChatGPT in macOS, ad well as iOS and iPadOS. Many features of ChatGPT are integrated with Apple apps starting in macOS Sequoia 15.1, and iOS and iPadOS 18.2.\n\nWhile Apple has stated support for Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT are evolving and still in progress, some features are working and included in Apple's operating systems. Expect a further phased rollout of Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT in the near future.\n\nFor a complete review of new Apple Intelligence iOS and iPadOS features, see our article iOS 18.1 & iPadOS 18.1 review: baby steps with Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn order to use ChatGPT in Notes, you have to have a subscription to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), Pro, Enterprise, Team, or Educational. OpenAI has stated support for ChatGPT free tier integration in macOS will be coming later in 2025.\n\nOpenAI has a pricing page, and at $20/month, the Plus tier is fairly reasonable. Plus or higher also gives you access to o1 and o1-mini models.\n\nIf you already have Apple Intelligence and the ChatGPT extension enabled, skip to the last section \"Using ChatGPT in Notes\". Even so, the next section below has some useful info on where ChatGPT is available in Apple apps.\n\nWhat's included\n\nIn the above versions of Apple's operating systems, Apple states Apple Intelligence is integrated into Notes, Photos, Siri, Safari, and other apps with Writing Tools. ChatGPT is also integrated into some of the apps.\n\nFor example, you can now use ChatGPT prompts in Siri for lookups. Apple Intelligence Writing Tools work anywhere there is a text field.\n\nWriting Tools include summarizing text, rewriting text, proofreading, and even composing text. Apple also provides summaries in the form of Notification summaries, web page summaries, and others.\n\nSummaries for web pages in browsers are particularly useful. Some third-party browsers such as Firefox also support summaries.\n\nYou can turn off Notification summaries separately in System Settings->Notifications->Summarize Notifications.\n\nApple promises that using Apple Intelligence does not send your data to Apple (although some parts of Siri can still require this).\n\nTurning on Apple Intelligence\n\nBefore you can use ChatGPT in Apple's apps you must first turn on Apple Intelligence in the System Settings app (or the Settings app in iOS).\n\nTo do so, open System Settings in the /Applications folder on your Startup Disk (or from the Apple menu), then scroll down and click on Apple Intelligence & Siri on the left.\n\nNext, on the right, click Get Apple Intelligence to begin the setup process. After clicking the button it will be replaced with text reading \"In Progress...\" while the additional software is downloaded and installed.\n\nThis may take a while (up to an hour or more on some Macs).\n\nWait for Apple Intelligence to install and set up.\n\nOnce that is completed, you'll get a notification that your Mac is ready to use Apple Intelligence. The System Settings button will reappear, but this time it reads Set Up Apple Intelligence.\n\nClicking that button displays a sheet that walks you through setting up each feature of Apple Intelligence. This is not unlike the sheets that appear when you set up a new Mac.\n\nThe first step is choosing which apps use summaries. You can skip this part by clicking Set Up Later if you don't want summaries.\n\nClick \"Set Up Apple Intelligence\" to get started.\n\nNext, you'll step through Siri setup, but mind that there's no way to opt-out on the sheet at this point. The setup notifies you that Siri may send some of your data to Apple (including audio), but that the data is not tied to your Apple account.\n\nClick Continue, then select a Siri Voice from the list provided. Click Continue again.\n\nNow the sheet gives you a chance to opt out of sending your data to Apple if you want. Click Not now to opt-out, then click Continue.\n\nApple Intelligence and Siri are now fully enabled and you can turn either off or back on by using the two sliders that appear in System Settings. Also now enabled at the bottom of the Apple Intelligence & Siri pane is an Extensions section, one of which is for ChatGPT:\n\nApple Intelligence installed and enabled in macOS Sequoia.\n\nTurning on ChatGPT\n\nGo ahead and click ChatGPT under Extensions to set up ChatGPT. There's also a slider for determining if you want to allow Siri to recommend using ChatGPT in some instances.\n\nNext, click the Set Up... button next to Use ChatGPT.\n\nYou'll now get another sheet telling you what ChatGPT can do: integrate with Siri, compose text in Writing Tools, and work with a ChatGPT account. Click Next - which leads you to another sheet informing you that the Mac works with ChatGPT in a way that preserves your privacy:\n\nYou decide what gets shared with ChatGPT You can turn ChatGPT off in System Settings any time You can use ChatGPT with an account, or use it anonymously\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT with an account, click the Use ChatGPT with an Account button. Otherwise, click the Enable ChatGPT button to use it anonymously.\n\nClick \"Set Up...\" to begin the setup of the ChatGPT extension.\n\nThere's also a privacy note button that gives you a text summary of Apple's and OpenAI's policy on ChatGPT privacy in the extension. If you want, you can Select All (Command-A) on the text, copy it by Control-clicking, then paste it into a file in TextEdit or another editor for later review.\n\nOf particular note are these paragraphs:\n\n\"If there is no explicit request to use ChatGPT, your request is analyzed to determine whether ChatGPT might have useful results. If it does, Siri will ask whether you would like to use ChatGPT. If you choose, Siri will send your request to ChatGPT and present the answer directly. You also can choose to disable Siri asking you to confirm whether Siri should send a request to ChatGPT by going to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > ChatGPT, and tapping to turn off Confirm ChatGPT Requests.\n\nWhen you use Writing Tools and visual intelligence with the Camera Control, you will be able to choose whether you would like to use the ChatGPT extension for each of these features separately.\"\n\nThe note then goes on to explain that, in anonymous mode, it is OpenAI's official policy that it must not store requests, or their results (unless required by law), and it must not use requests to train its models. Attached documents are also not stored in anonymous mode.\n\nIn anonymous mode, OpenAI does not receive any info about your Apple account, and your IP address is hidden from OpenAI servers. General location information is however sent for the purposes of \"enabling ChatGPT to prevent fraud and comply with applicable law\".\n\nYou can turn off ChatGPT and its interaction with Apple Intelligence in the Extensions pane at any time, in the same way that you turned it on. You can also leave Apple Intelligence and/or Siri turned on, even if you turn the ChatGPT extension off.\n\nAfter you've read and understood the Privacy statement, return to the Extension pane, and click Enable ChatGPT. Once ChatGPT is enabled in System Settings, you can later click the Sign In button, and turn it off entirely using the slider.\n\nOpenAI \"Advanced Capabilities\" are free up to a certain limit, then basic ChatGPT functionality is available until twenty-four hours have elapsed.\n\nThere's also a slider for confirming Siri requests.\n\nThis completes the set up of both Apple Intelligence and the ChatGPT extension.\n\nUsing ChatGPT in Notes\n\nOnce Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT have been enabled, you can now use them in Writing Tools in any app that supports text editing - including the Notes app.\n\nCurrently to use ChatGPT/Notes integration you have to be signed into a ChatGPT account because OpenAI has to verify your paid pricing tier. If you're not signed in, go back to the Extension pane in System Settings for ChatGPT and click the Sign In button.\n\nYou'll also need to go to the Settings page for your ChatGPT account, enable the Works With Apps setting, then click Manage Apps to select which apps you want to allow ChatGPT to work with.\n\nTo use ChatGPT in Notes, open the Notes app, select any note on the left, then press Option+Shift+1 on your keyboard. This brings up the ChatGPT prompt in which you can type a question to get an answer for the information contained in the selected note.\n\nIf, for some reason, the Note can't be processed, ChatGPT servers can't be reached, or you're not signed in to ChatGPT, you'll hear the macOS system sound.\n\nThere's also a voice mode you can enable to control ChatGPT.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nChatGPT integration with Apple apps is exciting because it promises to take automation to a whole new level. This includes lookups, summaries, editing, condensing, composing, and more.\n\nWhat would really be cool would be for Apple to provide some other automation features from a UI standpoint (much like AppleScript does today). For example, one could imagine telling ChatGPT to select all notes with certain titles or content, and then merging them, condensing their content, removing parts of content, or sending them somewhere else.\n\nVoice control combined with UI interaction could be really powerful.\n\nImagine having one hundred notes in the Notes app and telling ChatGPT to \"Merge all notes containing Apple-related content\". That could save hours.\n\nThe possibilities may be endless."

Looking at actions like saves, we were able to see which colors are driving engagement over time.\u201d\n\nThe report identifies the colors most likely to resonate with audiences this year, which Pinterest\u2019s team has narrowed down to five key hues.\n\nEach color gets its own overview, which includes Pin examples, hex codes, and a listing of tags related to that shade.\n\nIt\u2019s a good-looking report, which likely means that Pinterest has got the colors right, and they do feel fresh and vibrant, even if a bit Christmas-y.\n\n\u201cBrands can tap into the colors shaping the year ahead for mood boards, product launches, or creative campaigns. For example, health-focused condiment brand Primal Kitchen referenced Pinterest Predicts and the Pinterest Palette for their Colorful Kitchen Tour last year. Fusing the 2024 Pinterest Palette with their core brand colors, Primal Kitchen launched new dipping sauces with Predicts-inspired \u201cKitschens\u201d pop-ups in three major cities.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way that you can use this insight, while it might also give you the spark of inspiration you need to refresh your branding efforts for the year ahead, with trending color tones that align with your audience.\n\nOr you might go with something else entirely, and that might also align with your customers\u2019 interests. There are no prescriptive rules here, but it is worth checking out Pinterest\u2019s color trends, and considering what they might mean for your brand efforts in 2025.\n\nYou can download Pinterest\u2019s \u201c2025 Pinterest Palette\u201d report here.\n\nRecommended Reading"

            "article_content": "The new Aurora Cloud Console, a groundbreaking, free-to-use plug-and-play solution for setting up your own decentralized network, has made it easier to create a blockchain than ever before.\n\nAurora Labs said in an announcement today that it\u2019s targeting decentralized application and memecoin developers who\u2019re fed up with the sluggish transaction speeds and lack of customization options on better-known blockchains such as Ethereum. Instead of deploying your dApp or token on that network, the Aurora Cloud Console gives you the option of creating a dedicated and customized blockchain for your own purposes.\n\nIn this way, it\u2019s breaking new ground in blockchain accessibility by tearing down the technical barriers to building decentralized networks.\n\nPreviously, the only people who would even dare to try and create their own blockchains are developers who possess years of expertise in software development, as well as knowledge of specialist programming languages like Solidity.\n\nWhat Aurora Lab\u2019s platform provides\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible for absolutely anyone to create their own blockchain, using Aurora\u2019s sophisticated no-code platform. Aurora Cloud Console aims to make the task as simple as creating an online store using a service such as Shopify. All you have to do is follow the step-by-step instructions, where you\u2019ll set parameters such as the gas fees, the native token and the kinds of permissions available. Once done, it will handle all the nasty, technical coding stuff for you. The end result will be a highly scalable Aurora Virtual Chain based on NEAR Protocol\u2019s ultra-rapid infrastructure, boasting superfast transaction speeds, EVM-compatibility and enterprise-grade security, plus access to a vast ecosystem of other dApps and Web3 services.\n\nAurora Labs has aspirations to get as many as 1,000 connected blockchains up and running by the end of the year. It\u2019s targeting creators of memecoins and other Web3 projects, and argues that building your own, customized EVM-compatible network will be the fastest way to scale.\n\nThe arrival of Aurora Cloud Console comes after the debut of TurboChain last month. That new network was one of the very first Aurora Virtual Chains to be deployed. It\u2019s a dedicated chain for the popular meme coin TURBO, which was previously deployed on Ethereum. By launching its own chain, the TURBO coin community is setting itself up for further growth, enabling users to pay their transaction gas fees using the TURBO token instead of ETH.\n\nAurora Labs Chief Executive Alex Shevchenko spelled out how big a deal the new platform really is, saying it allows anyone to create a fully customizable chain from scratch within days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve removed the complexity, so builders can focus on creating great products while tapping into a thriving ecosystem of liquidity, tools, and users,\u201d the executive explained. \u201cAurora Cloud Console is the gateway to Web3.\u201d\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

Tobias H\u00fcttl, Head of Design Studio at Porsche, kindly sat down with me to answer a few questions on this automotive design collaboration for Honor's new Magic 7 series.\n\nHonor and Porsche have collaborated for three generations of smartphones now, starting with the Honor Magic V2, followed by the Porsche Design Magic 6. The newest Honor Magic7 RSR from Porshe Design however takes this to new levels, yet continues the iconic hexagonal camera design trend that we\u2019ve seen on previous Porsche X Honor handsets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was invited by Honor to the stunning resort of Bled in Slovenia this week to see first-hand the new Magic 7 AI devices (including the indestructible Magic 7 Lite), and to experience the company's innovations in advanced durable AI technology. This Porsche handset is not only exquisite, but ignites an existing trend of merging premium sports car-inspired design with the latest tech. Tobias H\u00fcttl shares the Magic7 RSR colour selection and design process.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nDo you have a favourite aspect of the RSR 7 phone? A favourite design element?\n\nI like the fact that you can hold it in your hand and it feels premium and special, right? Without needing a visual of it. So I think that's very nice. And I also like the sharp edges that you can feel around the camera unit at the back, I think that's adding this very central quality that helps people appreciate the project.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about the colours of the Honor Magic7 RSR Porsche design?\n\nThe two colours that we have are Agate Grey and Provence. With those colours, we hoped to differentiate quite strongly between customer choices. Provence is much more subtle than the Frozen Berry Metallic [this was a colour option available with the Magic 6] which is more vibrant, and as the name suggests, more like an ice cream. But the Provence is something that\u2019s toned down, less reflective, with less saturation. I think it's also a little bit more bluish compared to the Frozen Berry.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've tried different directions, and then the choice finally fell on the Provence. We think it's a bit of a mystery colour, and it's something that's still subtle, but at the same time, I think that's something that we like a lot about it. It's not resembling a super strong race car colour or anything. It's elegant still, even though it's something that people can recognize and see as something special.\n\nIs there a reason why you didn't opt for turbonite as a colour choice for the phone?\n\n[This is the popular grey Pantone hue that was made exclusively for Porsche].\n\nSo the turbonite is interesting because it's dedicated to Porsche's turbo collection, right? So with our phone not being a turbo phone, it would not have been a very consistent story.\n\nRead more: Porsche's turbonite is the most surprising colour trend of NYFW\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nIs this handset trying to sell a smartphone to a Porsche owner, or a Porsche to Honor customers?\n\nIt can work both ways. I mean, in the end, I think that the product should stand for itself. It should have a quality for itself, character for itself. There is a connection, for sure, with everything that's in the Porsche cosmos and with the Porsche DNA as well. We think that it's grown up enough to hold its own justification and attraction as a product.\n\nHow did you work with Honor over decisions such as colour, material, and form?\n\nIn the beginning, with the ideation phase, we're very broad. So we are looking into all different kinds of directions and ideas, but then there are certain colours which work in certain settings and maybe not in others. Some things make sense with the design of the car but not so much within the phone world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith Honor, we kind of sit down and discuss together what's the common denominator within our understanding of aesthetics, and then we find the right material for the right product. Materials are always something that we are interested in. If you look at the phones, materials are one of the differentiating factors.\n\nDid you seek any feedback from customers and fans of the brand?\n\nThere's lots of input from all kinds of dimensions. So there are customer inputs, and there's also market inputs that we have within our broader corporation, but eventually, we made a decision with what colour to go with on an informed basis.\n\nWere there any big design decisions that you couldn't agree on?\n\nIt's always like that. I think that\u2019s the nature of design. You come up with a lot of ideas, but then again, I think it's very important to also have restrictions in the design process. So it was the balance between something that people think of without any kind of limitations, and that's what's possible on the other side, and in the end, you find the best solution with a product that's feasible and aesthetically pleasing. There are mostly technical limitations. Things like user habits and economics people have that we have to take into account.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDid Porsche Design have any input on the software within the Magic 7 series?\n\nSo what was important for us on the software part is that we have one design, for hardware and software, and we had a strong impact on the graphics for the user interface buttons as well, to make it a homogeneous experience as a user. There are new software features [compared with the Honor Magic 6] within the new iOS, so we've also taken that into account for the design elements.\n\nDo you feel that the crossover between automotive design and global fashion trends will eventually have the same weight in the smartphone industry?\n\nThat's very interesting. I think that people hold phones very dearly, and I think that's something that everyone has to deal with. So naturally, I think phones and cars are things that people will consider a very attractive product in their minds. So to think about the relationship of those two things is always important.\n\nIs there a colour that you absolutely would not consider for this particular brand of phone?\n\nI think it's always content-specific. It has to fit with the nature of the product and in this case with the RSR 7, I think the two colours that we have address a lot of customer needs. So you can have a buyer who is the subtle type, and the other one might be a bit more of the extrovert type. And I think it's a good mixture of colours. So I would say we keep this open. I wouldn't include all the colours. But logistically it's interesting.\n\nThe new Honor Magic7 RSR phone design incorporates some of Porsche's signature elements, including the hexagonal shape of the camera unit (resembling sports car headlights) and the seamless integration and nods to the aerodynamic aesthetics of the Porsche Taycan Turbo S sports car.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen I asked Tobias which phone colour he preferred out of the two options, he suggested, \"personally, I would just get both\".\n\nIf you're interested in owning this ultra-premium smartphone for yourself, expect to spend a staggering \u00a31,549. This exclusive and limited smartphone will be available soon, but to be notified and register your interest, be sure to head to the Porsche website for all the details."

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi. Domestic rivals have also achieved a fleet size in the hundreds, including Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go which operates more than 400 robotaxis in Wuhan, Hubei province.\n\nThe panel discussion on AI at the Post\u2019s China Conference in Nansha on Wednesday. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nIn the field of robotics, UBTech\u2019s chief brand officer Michael Tam said that US competitors, including Tesla and OpenAI, \u201care a little bit advanced\u201d in terms of developing the \u201cbrain\u201d of robots, which is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology that controls a robot\u2019s sensors and movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the recent rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which trained its large language model with fewer resources but ended up with one that matched or even exceeded in certain areas the performance of larger US competitors such as OpenAI and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, proved that \u201cthere\u2019s not so much [of a] gap between the US and mainland China\u201d for AI, Tam said."

            "article_content": "Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors.\n\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive thinks his company has the best artificial-intelligence technology on the market. Now he has to get consumers to care.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors and he wants the chatbot built on it to be used by 500 million people by the end of 2025, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t said how many people currently use Gemini, but market leader ChatGPT has about 300 million weekly users. The Gemini app was the 54th most downloaded free app on iPhones Wednesday. ChatGPT was No. 4.\n\nGoogle was caught flat-footed by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite being one of the pioneers of AI and spending years working on similar chatbots. The company has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nGemini isn\u2019t yet a serious moneymaker, but it is central to Google\u2019s push to stay on the cutting edge of AI, a technology already starting to reshape the company\u2019s core search and ads businesses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s newest AI technology jumped ahead of ChatGPT maker OpenAI\u2019s technology last month on the Chatbot Arena rankings closely watched by people in Silicon Valley. OpenAI dominated the rankings for much of the past year.\n\nGoogle launched the Gemini chatbot, formerly Bard, a few months after ChatGPT and has updated it with dozens of new features in an effort to gain ground. OpenAI, meanwhile, began directly targeting Google last summer when it added a web-search function to ChatGPT.\n\nThe ChatGPT mobile app has been downloaded about 465 million times on Android and iOS devices, compared with 106 million for Gemini, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nMost of those downloads came on Android phones. Until recently, Gemini was part of Google\u2019s search app on Apple devices. A separate Gemini app for iOS made its debut in November. Google said it was downloaded more than 10 million times through the end of the year.\n\nUsage of AI features built into other applications, such as Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, aren\u2019t captured by publicly available measures.\n\nUntil recently, the Gemini chatbot team reported to the executive in charge of search and ads, but a recent reorganization moved it to the Google DeepMind division that does advanced research.\n\nPichai said at the time that the move would \u201cenable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app.\"\n\nGrowth in search advertising has slowed in recent years, and Google has increasingly looked to new business lines including subscriptions. It offers a premium version of Gemini with more features for $20 a month, similar to other chatbots.\n\nBut unlike its competitors, Google packages its Gemini subscription with perks including AI features in apps like Gmail and two terabytes of file storage.\n\nSifei Han, a data scientist living in Philadelphia, upgraded to the Gemini premium plan last year after being offered a two-month free trial. He said he mainly uses it for the extra storage, not the AI features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with ChatGPT\u2019s style,\" said Han, who also pays for ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAbout 60% of Gemini\u2019s paying users kept their subscriptions six months after first signing up, according to an Earnest Analytics analysis of debit- and credit-card data from millions of anonymous consumers. That was better than some competitors such as Character.AI and Perplexity, but lagged behind OpenAI and Anthropic, which makes the chatbot Claude.\n\nSubscriptions to Gemini were a fraction of the $10.7 billion in revenue Google parent Alphabet made from subscriptions, device sales and purchases in its mobile app store in the three months ended September. Google\u2019s core advertising business brought in $65.9 billion during the same period. The company hasn\u2019t introduced ads in Gemini.\n\nGemini has been a source of controversy in the past. Google apologized to users and rolled back an image-generation feature last year after the chatbot produced images of Black soldiers in Nazi garb and sometimes refused to generate depictions of white people. It restored the feature six months later.\n\nIn addition to the chatbot, Gemini is powering features that perform complex tasks for users, like preparing research reports and generating podcasts based on a set of documents.\n\nGoogle sells the technology that powers Gemini to developers, uses it for the \u201cAI overviews\" that sometimes appear at the top of search results and recently began packaging it with the business versions of Gmail and Google Drive. Pichai has said all of Google\u2019s products with more than two billion users now have features powered by Gemini.\n\nThe company has also tried to convince device manufacturers to make Gemini the default assistant on mobile phones, which it already does on its own Pixel phones. Motorola and OnePlus, which both use Google\u2019s Android mobile software, made Gemini the default on some of their phones last year.\n\nWrite to Miles Kruppa at"

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\n\n\n\nBack to Healio\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe algorithm analyzed motion in REM sleep and used five movement features to detect REM sleep behavior disorder.\n\nThose with iRBD had increased amount of shorter movements, duration vs. healthy controls.\n\nAn automated machine-learning method that analyzed sleep movements recorded with a conventional 2D camera may improve diagnosis of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, according to a study published in Annals of Neurology.\n\n\u201cIsolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early manifestation of synucleinopathy that affects 1% to 1.5% of the middle-aged and older populations,\u201d Emmanuel During, MD, associate professor of neurology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and colleagues wrote. \u201cThe neurophysiologic mechanism of RBD is motor disinhibition during REM sleep, causing repeated and brief movements of the extremities, head or trunk.\u201d\n\nNew research into AI-based analysis of sleep disorders found a machine model detected REM sleep disorder behavior with 91.9% accuracy. Image: Adobe Stock\n\nWhile the definitive diagnosis of iRBD requires in-laboratory video polysomnography, which can be both costly and challenging to interpret, a recent study used a 3D time-of-flight camera in a sleep laboratory with high accuracy, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn this study, During and colleagues sought to replicate and expand on those results utilizing a conventional 2D camera to monitor patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep difficulties and create a machine-learning analysis method, to replicate prior research attempted with a 3D lens in track sleep-related movements.\n\nTheir study featured 172 participants \u2014 81 with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls \u2014 evaluated between 2016 and 2022 at Stanford Sleep Center. The control group included 28 healthy sleepers and 63 individuals with other sleep disorders, who were matched to iRBD patients by age and sex.\n\nAll video-EEG polysomnography recordings were made with a 2D camera, shooting at 30 frames per second and were manually scored by two blinded sleep experts. A blinded sleep specialist also reviewed all recordings of iRBD patients to determine which individuals had visible movements in REM sleep.\n\nThe researchers then used an optical flow computer vision algorithm to analyze these recordings and extract features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility.\n\nAfter review, it was determined that the control group was comprised of 28 healthy individuals and 63 with a sleep disorder. Within the iRBD group, 11 individuals did not have visible movements during REM sleep.\n\nAccording to results, individuals with iRBD demonstrated an increased amount of movements (56.3 vs. 41.8 per hour; average movement duration, 3.4 vs. 4.2 seconds) and immobility periods, compared with controls.\n\nThe accuracy for distinguishing iRBD from other sleep disorders ranged from 84.9% to 87.2%, with the highest accuracy (91.9%) achieved when combining all five movement features and analyzing only short movements. Of 11 patients with iRBD without visible movements during REM sleep, seven were correctly identified.\n\n\u201cThis automated approach could be integrated into clinical workflow during the interpretation of sleep tests to enhance and facilitate diagnosis, and avoid missed diagnoses,\u201d During said in a related Mount Sinai press release. \u201cThis method could also be used to inform treatment decisions based on the severity of movements displayed during the sleep tests and, ultimately, help doctors personalize care plans for individual patients.\u201d\n\nReference:"

            "source": "USA Today",
            "article_content": "Senators on Thursday pressed some of President-elect Donald Trump's top Cabinet picks on his central campaign promises, critical natural disaster relief and more.\n\nInterior secretary nominee Doug Burgum, proposed Environmental Protection Agency director Lee Zeldin, Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Housing secretary nominee Scott Turner all went before lawmakers. After fiery faceoffs earlier in the week, they were asked in calmer hearings about the nation's economy and readiness for natural disasters.\n\nBessent would be Trump\u2019s point person on GOP priorities such as tax cuts and tariffs. Meanwhile, Burgum and Zeldin would both have sway over the Trump administration's energy policy, a cornerstone of the president-elect's reelection bid.\n\nHere are USA TODAY's top takeaways from the hearings.\n\nMore:Takeaways from Senate confirmation hearings: Democrats grill Trump Cabinet nominee\n\nBipartisan concerns about tariffs\n\nTrump often talks about implementing tariffs on foreign goods, deploying them during his first term and promising more in a second administration.\n\n\u201cThe word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word - one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard,\u201d Trump told a crowd of Georgia supporters in September. \u201cIt's music to my ears.\u201d\n\nBessent, a prominent hedge fund manager, said Americans should think about tariffs in three ways under Trump: A negotiating tactic, a tool to remedy \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and a way to raise revenue.\n\nBut some lawmakers are nervous about mores tariffs.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Bessent that tariffs on Canadian goods could strike the economy in his New England state.\n\n\u201cWhat reassurance can we get from the Trump administration that there\u2019s going to be a do-no-harm policy to American consumers and Vermont workers and small businesses with a tariff policy?\u201d Welch asked.\n\nBessent argued Trump is sensitive to the needs of \"working America,\" but he admitted to lawmakers it's \u201cvery difficult for me to isolate Vermont especially.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on U.S. farmers\n\n\u201cOveruse of tariffs can inflate costs and provoke trade retaliation,\u201d Young told Bessent. \u201cAs Hoosier farmers have experienced first hand over the years, they often bare the impact.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to impose massive tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status are likely to reignite inflation and dampen economic growth, according to forecasters.\n\nYet his pledge to extend and expand the sweeping tax cuts passed in his first term and ease the regulatory burden on businesses could juice the economy and have mixed effects on inflation.\n\nClimate questions\n\nTrump has promised to expand oil production in the U.S., and he'll lean on Burgum to help. The former North Dakota governor told senators he believes America has reached an energy crisis, but he also believes climate change exists.\n\nRepublicans like West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who owns a coal mining business, told Burgum energy is \u201ca key that opens every door.\u201d\n\nDemocrats like Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, pointed to testimonies previously given by former Secretaries of Defense James Mattis and Chuck Hagel. They said climate change is a national security threat that affects areas where troops are stationed.\n\nMore:'When can he start?': Trump allies bullish on Cabinet nominees getting confirmed\n\n\u201cWithin fossil fuels, the concern has been about emissions, and within emissions, we have the technology to do things like carbon capture to eliminate harmful emission,\u201d Burgum said.\n\nMore:What is carbon capture and how does it work? Inside the process that could slow global warming\n\n\u201cYou have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue,\" Hirono shot back. \"For you to take the position that you're going to engage in active actions that will result in the burden of burning more fossil fuel, it's troubling.\"\n\nZeldin was also questioned about climate change.\n\n\u201cDo you agree with President-elect Trump that climate change is a hoax?\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked.\n\nZeldin replied that he believes climate change is real, before defending his potential future boss.\n\n\u201cAs far as President Trump goes, the context that I have heard him speak about it was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there\u2019s a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would respectfully disagree with you,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWildfire control \u2018very key\u2019\n\nCalifornia wildfires have left 25 dead and thousands of schools, businesses and other structures destroyed in the Greater Los Angeles area. Lawmakers asked Trump's nominees about the blazes during Thursday's hearings.\n\nSens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., opened their remarks by addressing the fires. Lee directed Burgum that, if he's confirmed, addressing wildfires that shocked Western states should be a \"very key priority\" for the country's future.\n\nElsewhere, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned Zeldin on his willingness to advocate for Californians affected by the Los Angeles-area wildfires fires. Trump and certain House Republicans have signaled their interest in placing conditions on disaster aid for California, amid tense relations between the president-elect and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\u201cI assume, Mr. Zeldin, your response will not depend on whether disaster strikes a red state or a blue state, you will equally work to speed relief to those Americans affected?\u201d Schiff asked.\n\n\u201cYes, senator,\u201d Zeldin replied. The potential Trump pick vowed he would \"do everything in my power to be able to assist\" devastated communities.\n\nTax fight preview\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement during his first administration was a massive tax cut.\n\nSome of those tax cut provisions expire at the end of 2025. Trump wants to extend them and has promised new cuts, including ending taxes on tipped wages and Social Security payments.\n\nBessent said extending the Trump tax cuts is the single most important economic issue of the day.\n\n\u201cThis is pass- fail, that if we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity,\u201d he said.\n\nBessent was also asked about everything from increasing the federal minimum wage to capping credit card interest rates and increasing economic sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBessent said he doesn\u2019t support increasing minimum wage nationally. He argued it's a step that should be taken by states instead.\n\nLater, he was open to increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"If any officials in the Russian Federation are watching this confirmation hearing they should know that if I'm confirmed, and if President Trump requests as part of his strategy to end the Ukraine war, that I would be 100% on board for taking sanctions up,\" Bessent said.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson"

Montech has taken note of this trend but has chosen a completely new direction with its latest small mid-tower case called the Heritage.\n\nFirst showcased at Computex 2024, the most striking feature of this micro-ATX case is the premium styling that incorporates durable metal with synthetic leather, offering what Montech describes as \u201cunmatched elegance and practicality.\u201d The use of leather styling extends to triangular patches on the side panels, a section around the front I/O ports, and even a convenient carrying strap. This removable strap can be potentially useful for enthusiasts who attend LAN parties or frequently transport their systems.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nThe Montech Heritage PC case\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nThe Montech Heritage PC case\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nThe Montech Heritage PC case\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nThe Montech Heritage PC case\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nThe Montech Heritage PC case with fan, motherboard, GPU, and PSU support options\n\nThe case does seem functional and visually appealing. It measures 480 x 235 x 368mm making it slightly larger than the Lian Li Dan A3 m-ATX case, which offers 26.3 liters of capacity, while the Heritage provides a roomier 30 liters. The case offers support for m-ATX and mini-ITX motherboards, CPU air coolers up to 170mm in height, and radiators up to 360mm for liquid cooling. The case also allows for three 120mm or two 140mm fans on the top, while the bottom accommodates three 120mm fans.\n\nAdditional mounting spots include positions for two 120mm fans on the side near the motherboard and one at the rear. Montech will include four preinstalled 120mm fans with the case.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor easy maintenance, the case also features removable dust filters on the top and bottom. Storage mounting options include a single option for a 3.5-inch or two 2.5-inch HDD/SSDs behind the motherboard mounting plate. As for the front I/O panel, it includes dedicated power and reset buttons, a headset audio jack, two USB Type-A 5 Gbps ports, and a USB Type-C 20 Gbps port. Full-size ATX power units up to 165mm in length are supported which can be installed at the front. Depending on the three height-varying mounting positions for the PSU, the case can accommodate beefy high-performance GPUs with lengths of up to 400mm.\n\nThe Montech Heritage case will be available starting January 18, 2025, in two color options: black and white. Priced at $89.99, it offers a competitive balance of premium materials and practicality."

            "article_content": "Coined in 2010 by Forrester Research, the term \"zero trust\" has long been hijacked by security vendors eager to take advantage of the hype that surrounds the concept. Today, it's so overused and misused that many see it as a meaningless buzzword\u2014but that's far from the truth. In fact, its widespread misappropriation demonstrates the power of zero trust security. Why else would countless vendors try to capitalize on it? As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nZero trust is not a mere label. Rather, zero trust is an architecture\u2014though you'll also hear of a zero trust methodology, framework, paradigm, and infrastructure\u2014and it's based on the idea of zero implicit trust, meaning no one should be trusted by default. The key zero trust principle of least-privileged access says a user should be given access only to a specific IT resource the user is authorized to access, at the moment that user needs it, and nothing more. Hence the zero trust maxim, \"never trust, always verify.\"\n\nAs a networking and security strategy, zero trust stands in stark contrast to traditional, network-centric, perimeter-based architectures built with firewalls and VPNs, which involve excessive permissions and increase cyber risk. To learn about their weaknesses in more detail, you can read this ebook.\n\nThe main point is this: you cannot do zero trust with firewall- and VPN-centric architectures. Those approaches were not designed for today's world or its sophisticated cyberthreats, and that is why zero trust is now key for cybersecurity.\n\nSo, what sets zero trust apart and makes it a good fit for modern organizations?\n\nKey aspects of zero trust\n\nNot all segmentation is equal\n\nLateral movement is a step in the attack chain that occurs when a threat makes it past an organization's defenses and onto the network, where it moves across connected apps and expands the reach of the breach. This is an inherent weakness of perimeter-based architectures, which connect users to the network as a whole, giving them wide access to the resources therein.\n\nThe solutions to this problem are often assumed to be network segmentation and microsegmentation, whereby the network and its contents are split into smaller segments that are separated by (fire)walls. But this strategy is complex and expensive to set up and maintain, and tries to lessen a symptom of yesterday's architectures without solving the underlying problems: the architectures themselves.\n\nThe actual solution is zero trust segmentation. A zero trust architecture connects users directly to authorized apps in a one-to-one fashion\u2014nobody receives access to the network as a whole. As a result, the potential for lateral threat movement is eliminated, along with complexity and cost.\n\nSecure any entity accessing any resource\n\nPlenty of people hear \"zero trust\" and assume it's the same as zero trust network access (ZTNA). But ZTNA is a specific solution, not an architecture. What ZTNA does, despite its inaccurate naming convention, is provide users with zero trust access directly to private apps hosted in data centers and private clouds\u2014it does not give access to the network.\n\nZTNA is certainly a key part of any platform providing zero trust architecture, but it is not the whole story. Users access more than private applications alone. They also access the web, SaaS apps, and other IT resources across a variety of environments.\n\nBeyond that, it's not just users that need secure access. There are also workloads, IoT and OT devices, and B2B partners that regularly connect to IT resources. As such, having a complete zero trust architecture means securing any of these entities as they access any IT resource. This is why one will often hear the analogy of an intelligent switchboard that provides secure any-to-any connectivity in a one-to-one fashion.\n\nContext, context, context\n\nFrom the moment we are handed our first devices, we are conditioned to see identity authentication as the standard for cybersecurity. That typically carries through to conversations about identity and access management (IAM), where verifying user identity is seen as the ideal means of determining whether someone should be granted access to a resource. But identity alone is not enough\u2014even if it involves consideration of user group.\n\nThere are two reasons for this. First, users' identities can be stolen, as evinced by countless breaches involving the theft of VPN credentials. Second, users who are who they say they are can still engage in malicious or careless behavior that exposes organizations to cyberattacks and data loss.\n\nInstead of sticking to this risky status quo, zero trust uses context to assess risk and govern access. That does include identity (which is a core part of zero trust architecture), but it goes far beyond it to consider other variables like device posture, destination and content risk, user behavior, and more. As an added point, this contextual analysis typically requires a heavy dose of AI/ML.\n\nCyberthreat and data protection\n\nZero trust architecture stops cyberattacks in four key ways (some of which we've already mentioned):\n\nZero trust eliminates firewalls, VPNs, and their public IP addresses, which are attractive targets for cyberattackers. Instead, apps are hidden behind a zero trust cloud, eliminating the attack surface. In other words, inbound connections are replaced with inside-out connections. Zero trust prevents compromise through context-aware policies and, unlike hardware and virtual appliances, a high-performance cloud with the scalability necessary to inspect encrypted traffic (where most threats hide (but more on that below (aren't parentheses fun?))). Zero trust gives direct-to-app connectivity rather than network access, preventing the potential for lateral movement across resources. Zero trust stops data loss by, once again, inspecting encrypted traffic (where most data loss occurs), and protecting all modern data leakage paths, including SaaS app sharing, removable storage on endpoints, and a lot more.\n\nIn addition to the above, a fully featured zero trust platform should provide cyberthreat protection functionality like cloud sandboxing, DNS security, browser isolation, and more. Similarly, it should provide data protection capabilities like SSPM, out-of-band CASB, EDM, and more.\n\nSpecial delivery!\n\nTo dive a bit deeper into something alluded to above, zero trust is a cloud native architecture. That is, it cannot be achieved merely by deploying another appliance in a data center or private cloud. Rather, it is delivered as a service from a global, multitenant cloud that was built for the purpose of providing zero trust architecture at the edge, meaning as close to end users as possible.\n\nBecause this omnipresent cloud provides secure any-to-any connectivity along with all the security functions anyone could ask for, it's a perfect fit for modern organizations with widely distributed cloud resources, remote workers, and data. These organizations no longer have to backhaul traffic to their data centers or maintain the same complex, inbound and outbound stacks of security and networking appliances (whether hardware or virtual).\n\nAdditionally, unlike appliances, cloud scale means that zero trust has the performance necessary to inspect encrypted traffic. With nearly all web traffic now encrypted and 87% of cyberattacks hiding in encrypted traffic, this inspection is more important than ever.\n\nZero trust benefits\n\nReduced risk\n\nThe first and most obvious benefit of a zero trust architecture is that it systematically reduces cyber risk. Delivering zero trust segmentation from the cloud, securing every stage of the attack chain, providing comprehensive data and threat protection, and enforcing context- and risk-based policies for every entity accessing any resource ensures airtight defense.\n\nSuperior productivity\n\nWith zero trust, you can eliminate VPNs and stop backhauling traffic. Instead, you get direct-to-app connectivity through a global cloud with the scalability necessary to handle the traffic surges that appliances cannot. Adding built-in digital experience monitoring (DEM) to the equation further enhances the user experience benefits. The result is more user productivity, and with fewer tickets and managerial headaches for admins, help desk and networking productivity is enhanced, as well.\n\nReduced cost and complexity\n\nZero trust eliminates six significant costs of perimeter-based architectures because it:\n\nRemoves the need to buy a myriad of security and networking point products Reduces operational complexity and administrative burden Accelerates IT integration during M&A Minimizes the risk and, as a result, the cost of data breaches Enhances productivity, as mentioned above Reduces power consumption and carbon footprint\n\nDigital transformation\n\nBy transforming security and connectivity with zero trust, organizations the world over can embrace digital transformation both securely and effectively. Rather than force-fitting yesterday's approach to security and networking onto the modern workplace, organizations can leverage zero trust architecture and seamlessly take advantage of cloud apps, remote work, and whatever else the digital future may hold.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nIf you're looking to embrace a comprehensive zero-trust architecture that checks all the boxes and unlocks all the benefits described in this blog, there is only one choice: Zscaler, the original pioneer and continued innovator of zero trust.\n\nThe Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform is the world's largest inline security cloud. It comprises more than 160 data centers globally, processes over 500B transactions daily, secures more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies, and boasts a Net Promoter Score of more than 70 (while the SaaS average is less than 30). Zscaler has the proven scale and expertise necessary to help any organization successfully implement zero trust.\n\nIf you want to get started on your zero trust journey but aren't sure where to begin, register for our monthly live webinar, Zero Trust 101: Start Your Journey Here.

            "article_content": "\u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d is a phrase attributed to French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, though it is considered by historians to be apocryphal: meaning \u201cI am the state,\u201d it speaks to the king\u2019s absolute and divinely ordained power. Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."
