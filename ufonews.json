        "article_content": "In the final moments of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs,\u2018 the line between reality and fiction blurs as Jos\u00e9 de Zer loses himself in his search for the UFO. After a series of inexplicable events showcase themselves, the fakery being utilized by the protagonist to sell the vision to the watching public takes on a whole new dimension as certain elements prove themselves to be far more mysterious than established in the beginning. As Jos\u00e9 overcomes his feelings of imposter syndrome, a different kind of belief instills within him as he tries to find salvation in the message he has been spreading among his followers. However, it causes the movie to end in a very confusing way, which flips the script on the whole narrative! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nThe Man Who Loved UFOs Plot Synopsis\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer, an entertainment journalist for a TV news channel, suffers a seizure while interviewing a high-profile celebrity, Monica. The attack is triggered after Jos\u00e9 sees a blinding white light hovering above the sky and a strange high-pitched sound in his head. Subsequently, he wakes up in the hospital while his cameraman, Chango, watches him. One day, two residents from the nearby village of La Candelaria visit him at the hospital and propose for him to cover the story about a burnt pasture in their area. They suggest that the protagonist avail himself of a different angle, namely aliens, as they want tourism to spread in their small community, which has been lacking in advancement over the years.\n\nSubsequently, Jos\u00e9 embarks on a trip to La Candelaria with Chango and finds the burnt pasture in one of the surrounding hills. He conducts several interviews with the locals, who mostly speak about a UFO conspiracy being hidden by the government and higher authorities. With the recorded footage, the reporter heads back to his TV channel headquarters and presents it to his bosses, who disapprove of the idea immediately. Their reservations are mostly levied at Jos\u00e9\u2019s embellishment of the report to make it more exaggerated than usual. However, after various persuasive talks, the protagonist convinces them to air the video during the TV news show \u2018Notidiario.\u2019 When it is presented to the public, more doctored evidence is shown, such as burnt insects lying on the charred pasture.\n\nAs soon as the footage is released, the audience\u2019s interest in UFO sightings swells as Jos\u00e9 slowly becomes a household name. Despite being relegated to more obscure entertainment news over the years, his newfound fame drives more attention to his paranormal claims. More support is pumped into his venture as the journalist starts building a crew around himself who help him fabricate the alien story at a higher production level, which includes a mysterious engineer and self-proclaimed alien enthusiast named Sixto Schiaffino. However, amidst the fakery employed by the protagonist, things start heating up as sightings of real inexplicable saucers start appearing in real life. While he continues to believe in their reality, his daughter Martina is not entirely convinced of her dad\u2019s theories.\n\nThe Man Who Loves UFOs Ending: Are the Aliens Actually Real?\n\nOne of the most confusing and yet pivotal aspects of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 revolves around the existence of the aliens. Although Jos\u00e9 seems to have faith in their existence, for much of the narrative, he employs dodgy schemes to construct a fake reality to make others believe like him. It suggests that the aliens are simply a construct that the protagonist is using to garner more attention to his work, as he has somehow managed to enrapture them with his style of narration. However, the tricky part of the story is how it plays with the idea of belief and how it can determine what people see as real or not. In fact, during a conversation with his daughter, Jos\u00e9 mentions the same thing to her, telling her that if she believed the aliens did not exist, then they also did not exist in reality.\n\nIt adds a layer of complexity to the narration, especially in the later parts as the mysterious events start ramping up. Initially, the so-called alien visits are only relegated to a flashback in Jos\u00e9\u2019s past, specifically when he got lost in the Sinai desert during the Israel war. Whether it is real or not is left up to the audience at that point, with a majority of people likely to side with the latter. However, doubts start creeping in when the reporter becomes acquainted with Sixto Schiaffino, a man he calls Mr. Engineer. From the get-go, the movie presents him with a mysterious aura, albeit seeming ordinary on the surface. The more Jos\u00e9 dives into his supposed delusions, the more Mr. Engineer offers him spiritual advice and encourages him to keep spreading the words of the aliens.\n\nIn many ways, the movie revolves around the power of belief, and initially, Jos\u00e9 is far from a believer. He even expresses to Chango how skeptical he is of a higher power like God, considering the cruelties in the world. Meanwhile, his cameraman assures him that he himself is a believer. As the narrative progresses, the protagonist undergoes a radical shift in his belief system, going from someone who barely relates to any notion of divine authority to someone who clings to the grace and divinity of the aliens. To that end, the reality of the aliens within the story becomes a rather complicated discussion as it is mostly filtered through the eyes of Jos\u00e9. So, the answer might come down to a case of looking at the problem by subscribing to the protagonist\u2019s worldview from beginning to end.\n\nDoes Jose Survive the Cave Collapse?\n\nIn the final part, an excited Jos\u00e9 leads an expedition into a mining cave in the hills of La Candelaria, expecting to find answers to his burning questions about the aliens. After having spent months in the village concocting various reports, the journalist is given one last opportunity to craft a big story before he must leave the place. Consequently, his final adventure also turns out to be one of the most life-changing events. It begins with a helicopter ride through the area around the burnt pasture, during which Jos\u00e9 witnesses a real UFO zipping through the sky. While following it through the air, he and Chango end up at the mining cave. They venture into it despite protestations on the part of his cameraman. Unfortunately, Jos\u00e9 ends up getting trapped in the cave after he moves in too deep, separating him from Chango.\n\nWhile being stuck under a pile of rubble, the protagonist uses his lighter to read the nearby cave walls, which are decorated with all manner of hieroglyphs, most of them eerily recounting his own story thus far. Another strange occurrence takes place as Mr. Engineer materializes out of nowhere and speaks with Jos\u00e9. This adds even more talking points to the reality of the aliens, as Sixto could not have entered the cave after it collapsed. Mr. Engineer picks up one of the cave hieroglyphics and hands it over to the protagonist before disappearing. A few moments later, he is rescued by the local firefighters, who drag him out of the cave on a stretcher.\n\nWhy Does the UFO Take Jos\u00e9?\n\nThe most concrete evidence of the aliens presents itself in the ending moments of the movie. After being carried out by the firefighters, Jos\u00e9 flags down his daughter Martina and tells her in a state of adrenaline that the aliens want to take him with them. He hands her the cave hieroglyphic before he is wheeled into the ambulance and driven away. While Martina studies the hieroglyphic, a monumental revelation takes place as a gigantic UFO appears out of the clouds and uses its traction beam to lift the ambulance. The crowd gathered around the cave watches in stunned silence as the protagonist is taken into the UFO just like he envisioned previously after hearing Mr. Engineer. It is a game-changing final twist that leaves the ending with a sense of ambiguity and wonder.\n\nThere are several ways to interpret the UFO\u2019s appearance at the end and its reasons for taking Jos\u00e9 with it. The straightforward reading suggests that the aliens always existed, and everyone was blind to them except the protagonist, who saw them first in the Sinai desert during the war. Additionally, Mr. Engineer is one of those aliens who is hiding among humanity and providing support to the reporter as he is the staunchest follower and believer in the existence of extraterrestrials. Therefore, when the UFO appears and takes Jos\u00e9 away, it is a reward for his devotion to their ideals and holding on to his convictions despite the world ridiculing him. While it explains most of the ending, there may be an additional aspect to it.\n\nYears ago, when Jos\u00e9 got lost in the Sinai desert while fighting in the Israeli war, he came close to death several times and did not see any way out. In his derelict state, the vision of the UFO appearing out of nowhere must have felt like a sign of divinity or that his prayers had been answered, even if he was not religious. This highlights the crux of the movie, which uses UFOs as a substitute for religious faith. For most of the narrative, Jos\u00e9 has been striving to achieve that feeling of connection he felt when the UFO first appeared to him. Thus, his attempts at fabricating a lie to make people believe is irrelevant to his intentions of surrendering to his belief entirely. Because he achieves full spirituality in the end, the UFO appears to take him away and reveal its existence to the public, who doubts Jos\u00e9 all along.\n\nRead More: Jos\u00e9 De Zer: What Happened to Him?

AREA 51 is a highly classified US Air Force installation located in the state of Nevada. Its official name is the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), and it is primarily used to develop and test experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The base has sparked various conspiracy theories, particularly those involving alien technology and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), owing to its secrecy and the government's early denial of its existence. Area 51 is located in southern Nevada, about 83 miles (133 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. It was established in the early 1950s and initially used for testing the U-2 spy plane during the Cold War. The US government did not formally recognise the existence of Area 51 until 2013 when the CIA published declassified papers. The site has been linked to a variety of conspiracy theories about extraterrestrial life and superior technology. Popular culture has contributed to the base's mystery, frequently portraying it as a hub for UFO encounters and alien research. Area 51 is surrounded by restricted airspace, making unauthorised access prohibited. The surrounding areas are monitored, and warning signs indicate the base's restricted status. The base is notable for testing military aircraft, such as stealth bombers and spy planes, as well as classified technology.\n\nBut he acknowledged that countries like China are starting to develop their own technologies.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, they\u2019ve moved on from copying to creating their own designs.\u201d\n\nAs the investigation continues and the mystery of Area 51 persists, the FBI raid has only intensified the speculation surrounding the base.\n\nArnu remains undeterred in his mission to uncover the truth, despite the challenges he faces from authorities.\n\nIn 2022, his home was raided by the FBI and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n\nAuthorities dispatched 25 agents to search his property, seizing computers, hard drives, and other electronic devices.\n\nThis operation was part of an investigation into potential breaches of national security, leaving many to wonder what sensitive information the researcher may have possessed.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t fully understand why it happened. I\u2019ve always worked within legal limits,\u201d Arnu said.\n\nDespite the challenges Arnu has faced, including the recent FBI raid, he remains determined to keep Area 51 research alive.\n\nTo ensure the next generation of enthusiasts continues exploring the mysteries of the base, he launched a YouTube channel dedicated to educating people about Area 51.\n\n\u201cI hope that my legacy inspires others to dig deeper into these mysteries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe hopes to equip younger researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to investigate the site.\n\nArnu\u2019s goal is to present factual, verifiable information, in contrast to the many conspiracy theories that flood the internet.\n\nHe said: \"There\u2019s all these conspiracy websites, but what my website wants to be - and what my YouTube channel wants to be - is just to show people the real deal.\n\n\"I want people to come out here, form their own opinions, and do their own research.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Arnu hopes that his work will inspire others to continue the search for truth at Area 51 while providing guidance on how to legally and safely pursue their curiosity.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can come out here with binoculars, look at the base, no problem, but don\u2019t step across the border.\"\n\nWith new technologies potentially being developed behind its closed gates and a long history of secrecy, the base remains a hotbed of speculation.\n\nArnu\u2019s dedication to uncovering the mysteries and educating others will likely keep the spotlight on this enigmatic site for years to come.\n\nWhether it\u2019s alien technology, experimental aircraft, or classified military systems, the world is still eager to know what really lies within Area 51."

Now the horror movie studio behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Five Nights at Freddy's and BlacKkKlansman is working with Meta to test Meta Movie Gen, the AI video generator that the owner of Facebook and Instagram revealed earlier this month. And that could be a scary combination.\n\nSelect creatives are taking part in the pilot, including Casey Affleck from I\u2019m Still Here and Light of My Life, Aneesh Chaganty, and the Spurlock Sisters, who are part of Blumhouse\u2019s first annual Screamwriting Fellowship. Aneesh has already produced a video using Meta's AI tool in which he says he was all against AI until he realised that his ten-year-old self would have loved it for his homemade movies.\n\nFor the video above, Aneesh used Meta Movie Gen to change the backdrops or add special effects to short movies he made as a kid \u201cI hate AI. But with a tool like this? I dunno\u2026 maybe I\u2019d have just dreamed a little bigger,\" he says, noting that what he likes about the tool is that \"little Aneesh would still have had to make the movie.\"\n\nIt's an emotive and clever plug for the tech that highlights its potential for human-led storytelling while also excusing the current limited quality of the AI output. I mean, sure, it is good enough for a kid's home movie. I would have been thrilled to have had access to this tech when I was a kid trying to produce Doctor Who episodes in the lunch break at primary school.\n\nBlumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum continues the tone in his statement in Meta's announcement. \u201cArtists are, and forever will be, the lifeblood of our industry,\u201d he says. \"Innovation and tools that can help those artists better tell their stories is something we are always keen to explore, and we welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it\u2019s still in development.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThese are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it\u2019s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they\u2019re best suited for the job.\u201d\n\nAs for Meta, it says Movie Gen will allow creatives to more quickly express ideas and \"explore visual direction, tone and mood.\u201d \u201cWe heard that filmmakers see potential for Movie Gen as a collaborator and thought partner, with its unexpected response to text prompts inspiring new ideas,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also seems that public access to Movie Gen might arrive sooner than we thought. Meta initially said it had no plans to open access \"anytime soon\". But CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Instagram to say Movie Gen would be coming to the platform next year (he made the announcement via a video of himself doing leg presses in different historical eras \u2013 you can see that gem below).\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) A photo posted by on\n\nConnor Hayes, VP of gen AI, has confirmed that timeframe. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not planning to incorporate Movie Gen models into any public products until next year, Meta feels it\u2019s important to have an open and early dialogue with the creative community about how it can be the most useful tool for creativity and ensure its responsible use,\u201d he said.\n\nMeta's collaboration with Blumhouse is another example of how studios are starting to take AI video generation seriously. It comes shortly after Runway entered into a deal to create a bespoke AI model for the film and TV producer Lionsgate.\n\nMeta says Movie Gen can currently create videos of up to 16 seconds in different aspect ratios and audio of up to 45 seconds and that it compares well against Runway, OpenAI's Sora and Kling. If it gets a release, Meta's AI video generator is also likely to compete against Adobe Firefly Video, which is already powering the new Generative Extend in Premiere Pro.\n\nIt's not clear how the model was trained, however. Meta has said that Movie Gen was trained on a \u201ca combination of licensed and publicly available datasets\u201d but hasn't specified which. Meta has access to vast amounts of video data through its products like Instagram and Facebook."

        "article_content": "Dwarf planet Ceres (Credit: NASA/JPL-CalTech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2014 A dwarf planet hiding right in the middle of our solar system could be a surprising source of frozen water, astronomers reveal. A new study finds that Ceres, which sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, has a crust that\u2019s 90% ice. The discovery of this dirty ice crust has led scientists to believe this giant asteroid used to be a muddy water world. Astronomers have studied Ceres since it was first discovered in 1801. It is both a dwarf planet and the largest asteroid in our solar system. The protoplanet is spherical, with a diameter of approximately 590 miles, and is riddled with craters, volcanoes, and landslides. In 2007, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft to study Ceres. It reached the dwarf planet in 2015 and orbited it until 2018. While examining the rough surface, astronomers ruled out any signs of water existing on the asteroid because of the visible craters all over the surface. The common belief was that Ceres is relatively dry, with less than 30% ice.\n\nHowever, the new study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, argues that scientists might have judged this crater-rich planetoid too soon. The way the craters formed and the planet\u2019s mass suggest an ice-rich environment. Using spectrographic data from the Dawn mission and computer simulations, the researchers noticed that there may be ice in Ceres\u2019s subsurface. Gravity data also showed a density value close to that of impure ice. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s lots of water-ice near Ceres surface, and that it gets gradually less icy as you go deeper and deeper,\u201d says Mike Sori, an assistant professor in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, in a media release. \u201cPeople used to think that if Ceres was very icy, the craters would deform quickly over time, like glaciers flowing on Earth, or like gooey flowing honey. However, we\u2019ve shown through our simulations that ice can be much stronger in conditions on Ceres than previously predicted if you mix in just a little bit of solid rock.\u201d The researchers mapped out a geographical profile of an actual crater from Ceres and used the information to create computer simulations. The computer simulations modeled how the dwarf planet\u2019s craters relax and deform over billions of years. (Credit: Purdue University)\n\nAccording to the authors, the findings suggest Ceres was once a frozen ocean world similar to one of Jupiter\u2019s moons, Europa. The muddy ocean froze over time, creating an icy crust with some trapped rock. The ice-rich crust had found some way to resist crater relaxation. \u201cTo me the exciting part of all this, if we\u2019re right, is that we have a frozen ocean world pretty close to Earth,\u201d adds Sori. \u201cCeres may be a valuable point of comparison for the ocean-hosting icy moons of the outer solar system, like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\u201d The new findings could also warrant a manned space mission to the crater-rich dwarf planet as it may be one of the best chances astronauts have to visit an icy world. \u201cSome of the bright features we see at Ceres\u2019 surface are the remnants of Ceres\u2019 muddy ocean, now mostly or entirely frozen, erupted onto the surface. So we have a place to collect samples from the ocean of an ancient ocean world that is not too difficult to send a spacecraft to,\u201d Sori concludes."

The changes happening locally and globally in computing have created an incredible, once-in-a-generation opportunity that DPI is well-situated to harness for our state.\"\n\nDPI South will be a \"quantum-focused facility\" established in partnership with globally recognized companies, officials said.\n\nThe plan also includes maintaining downtown headquarters as \"DPI North.\" The institute will continue to operate from 200 S. Wacker Drive while also looking at options for locating the new DPI North.\n\nKilleen said the institute is committed to maintaining its headquarters in downtown Chicago.\n\n\"As a public university system, we must ensure that we maximize the benefits of DPI's headquarters for us, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois as this vital work continues,\" Killeen said.\n\nIn discussing these plans, UI officials said that the changes would allow the institute to \"optimize\" the impact of state funding and capitalize on opportunities presented by \"major shifts in technology\" as well as the federal CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nOver the seven years since DPI was announced, the potential of quantum computing to help solve challenges in a variety of areas \u2014 health care, food production, manufacturing and climate science, to name a few \u2014 has only become more evident, officials said.\n\nKilleen said the UI System has shared its new vision for DPI with Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who appreciated the magnitude of the opportunity and supports the expansion of its focus.\n\nThe state has provided $500 million for the institute and the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and innovation hubs throughout Illinois, under Pritzker's administration.\n\nThe state has also invested $500 million in developing the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park. Pritzker announced in July that the campus would be located at USX on the South Side of Chicago. It will be managed by a UI-led organization on behalf of the state and Pritzker."

The animated doodle shows a Staurikosaurus swiftly traversing an ancient landscape, highlighting its speed and agility. It also shows the dinosaur's distinctive long tail and bipedal stance, along with serrated teeth hinting at its predatory nature.\n\nDiscovery details\n\nStaurikosaurus: A significant find in dinosaur evolution\n\nPaleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Prince first discovered the Staurikosaurus in 1936, at the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Radiocarbon dating techniques have established that this ancient predator lived during the late Triassic period, some 225 million years ago. The dinosaur was relatively large for its time, measuring about two meters long and weighing around 30kg. Its bipedal stance and long tail indicate a fast-moving predator who was well-equipped to catch and hold prey.\n\nEvolutionary significance\n\nCrucial piece in the dinosaur evolution puzzle\n\nThe discovery of Staurikosaurus has been instrumental in furthering our understanding of dinosaur evolution. By studying this early theropod, paleontologists have been able to put together the puzzle of how these creatures first appeared on Earth and embarked on their remarkable journey. The Staurikosaurus continues to inspire awe and wonder, reminding us of the diversity and complexity of life that has existed on our planet."

        "article_content": "On October 16 1843, the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton had an epiphany during a walk alongside Dublin's Royal Canal. He was so excited he took out his penknife and carved his discovery right then and there on Broome Bridge.\n\nIt is the most famous graffiti in mathematical history, but it looks rather unassuming:\n\ni \u00b2 = j \u00b2 = k \u00b2 = ijk = \u20131\n\nYet Hamilton's revelation changed the way mathematicians represent information. And this, in turn, made myriad technical applications simpler \u2014 from calculating forces when designing a bridge, an MRI machine or a wind turbine, to programming search engines and orienting a rover on Mars . So, what does this famous graffiti mean?\n\nRotating objects\n\nThe mathematical problem Hamilton was trying to solve was how to represent the relationship between different directions in three-dimensional space. Direction is important in describing forces and velocities, but Hamilton was also interested in 3D rotations.\n\nMathematicians already knew how to represent the position of an object with coordinates such as x, y and z, but figuring out what happened to these coordinates when you rotated the object required complicated spherical geometry. Hamilton wanted a simpler method.\n\nHe was inspired by a remarkable way of representing two-dimensional rotations. The trick was to use what are called \" complex numbers \", which have a \"real\" part and an \" imaginary \" part. The imaginary part is a multiple of the number i, \"the square root of minus one\", which is defined by the equation i \u00b2 = \u20131.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRelated: Imaginary numbers could be needed to describe reality, new studies find\n\nBy the early 1800s several mathematicians, including Jean Argand and John Warren, had discovered that a complex number can be represented by a point on a plane. Warren had also shown it was mathematically quite simple to rotate a line through 90\u00b0 in this new complex plane, like turning a clock hand back from 12.15pm to 12 noon. For this is what happens when you multiply a number by i.\n\nWhen a complex number is represented as a point on a plane, multiplying the number by i amounts to rotating the corresponding line by 90\u00b0 counterclockwise. (Image credit: The Conversation, CC BY\n\nHamilton was mightily impressed by this connection between complex numbers and geometry, and set about trying to do it in three dimensions. He imagined a 3D complex plane, with a second imaginary axis in the direction of a second imaginary number j, perpendicular to the other two axes.\n\nIt took him many arduous months to realize that if he wanted to extend the 2D rotational wizardry of multiplication by i he needed four-dimensional complex numbers, with a third imaginary number, k.\n\nIn this 4D mathematical space, the k-axis would be perpendicular to the other three. Not only would k be defined by k \u00b2 = \u20131, its definition also needed k = ij = \u2013ji. (Combining these two equations for k gives ijk = \u20131.)\n\nPutting all this together gives i \u00b2 = j \u00b2 = k \u00b2 = ijk = \u20131, the revelation that hit Hamilton like a bolt of lightning at Broome Bridge.\n\nQuaternions and vectors\n\nHamilton called his 4D numbers \"quaternions\", and he used them to calculate geometrical rotations in 3D space. This is the kind of rotation used today to move a robot, say, or orient a satellite.\n\nBut most of the practical magic comes into it when you consider just the imaginary part of a quaternion. For this is what Hamilton named a \"vector\".\n\nA vector encodes two kinds of information at once, most famously the magnitude and direction of a spatial quantity such as force, velocity or relative position. For instance, to represent an object's position (x, y, z) relative to the \"origin\" (the zero point of the position axes), Hamilton visualised an arrow pointing from the origin to the object's location. The arrow represents the \"position vector\" x i + y j + z k.\n\nThis vector's \"components\" are the numbers x, y and z \u2014 the distance the arrow extends along each of the three axes. (Other vectors would have different components, depending on their magnitudes and units.)\n\nA vector (r) is like an arrow from the point O to the point with coordinates (x, y, z). (Image credit: The Conversation, CC BY\n\nHalf a century later, the eccentric English telegrapher Oliver Heaviside helped inaugurate modern vector analysis by replacing Hamilton's imaginary framework i, j, k with real unit vectors, i, j, k. But either way, the vector's components stay the same \u2014 and therefore the arrow, and the basic rules for multiplying vectors, remain the same, too.\n\nHamilton defined two ways to multiply vectors together. One produces a number (this is today called the scalar or dot product), and the other produces a vector (known as the vector or cross product). These multiplications crop up today in a multitude of applications, such as the formula for the electromagnetic force that underpins all our electronic devices.\n\nA single mathematical object\n\nUnbeknown to Hamilton, the French mathematician Olinde Rodrigues had come up with a version of these products just three years earlier, in his own work on rotations. But to call Rodrigues' multiplications the products of vectors is hindsight. It is Hamilton who linked the separate components into a single quantity, the vector.\n\nEveryone else, from Isaac Newton to Rodrigues, had no concept of a single mathematical object unifying the components of a position or a force. (Actually, there was one person who had a similar idea: a self-taught German mathematician named Hermann Grassmann, who independently invented a less transparent vectorial system at the same time as Hamilton.)\n\nHamilton also developed a compact notation to make his equations concise and elegant. He used a Greek letter to denote a quaternion or vector, but today, following Heaviside, it is common to use a boldface Latin letter.\n\nThis compact notation changed the way mathematicians represent physical quantities in 3D space.\n\nTake, for example, one of Maxwell's equations relating the electric and magnetic fields:\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2013\u2202B/\u2202t\n\nWith just a handful of symbols (we won't get into the physical meanings of \u2202/\u2202t and \u2207 \u00d7), this shows how an electric field vector (E) spreads through space in response to changes in a magnetic field vector (B).\n\nWithout vector notation, this would be written as three separate equations (one for each component of B and E) \u2014 each one a tangle of coordinates, multiplications and subtractions.\n\nThe expanded form of the equation. As you can see, vector notation makes life much simpler. (Image credit: The Conversation, CC BY\n\nThe power of perseverance\n\nI chose one of Maxwell's equations as an example because the quirky Scot James Clerk Maxwell was the first major physicist to recognise the power of compact vector symbolism. Unfortunately, Hamilton didn't live to see Maxwell's endorsement. But he never gave up his belief in his new way of representing physical quantities.\n\nHamilton's perseverance in the face of mainstream rejection really moved me, when I was researching my book on vectors . He hoped that one day \u2014 \"never mind when\" \u2014 he might be thanked for his discovery, but this was not vanity. It was excitement at the possible applications he envisaged.\n\nA plaque on Dublin's Broome Bridge commemorates Hamilton's flash of insight. (Image credit: Cone83 via Wikimedia, CC BY-SA\n\nHe would be over the moon that vectors are so widely used today, and that they can represent digital as well as physical information. But he'd be especially pleased that in programming rotations, quaternions are still often the best choice \u2014 as NASA and computer graphics programmers know.\n\nIn recognition of Hamilton's achievements, maths buffs retrace his famous walk every October 16 to celebrate Hamilton Day. But we all use the technological fruits of that unassuming graffiti every single day."

Despite the recent lack of form, Alabama is favored by 3 points over Tennessee for Saturday\u2019s game at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville.\n\nTennessee began the season hot but came back to Earth with a road loss to Arkansas. The Vols needed overtime to beat Florida at home last week. The last time Tennessee met Alabama in Knoxville, Tennessee won an all-time thriller on a last-second field goal.\n\nWith Alabama struggling on defense and Tennessee boasting an offensive with high-scoring potential, Saturday\u2019s game has a lofty over/under of 56.5 points."

Get $50 in bonus bets once they sign up and their initial wager settles.\n\nAlabama vs. Tennessee odds to use with your DraftKings promo code\n\nBoth teams enter Saturday\u2019s contest with plenty of excitement, but underwhelming play in their past two games. The Crimson Tide suffered an upset loss to Vanderbilt, then narrowly escaped with a victory against South Carolina.\n\nThe Volunteers lost on the road against Arkansas before squeaking out a win against Florida last week. Now they arrive Saturday with high playoff stakes and plenty to prove.\n\nDespite the Crimson Tide\u2019s history, the Kalen DeBoer era will be built on offensive success, and, outside of last weekend, the unit has been phenomenal to this point.\n\nVols DL James Pearce Jr. will create some chaos off of the edge to keep Alabama QB Jalen Milroe hemmed in, but it won\u2019t be to the same effect that South Carolina\u2019s Kyle Kennard and Dylan Stewart had last weekend. Expect Alabama to get back to its explosive ways in the passing game."
