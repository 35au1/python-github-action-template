A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Another mysterious 'orange UFO orb' was spotted flying over the US, however, this time the inexplicable glow was seen conspicuously hovering over a military base in Tennessee.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border - on New Year's Day.\n\nThe user, who witnessed the perplexing 'celestial' event alongside their father, who is a seasoned Army veteran, said that they 'couldn't explain' what they were seeing in the skies above.\n\n'My dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before,' the post reads.\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the Redditor, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb.\n\n'Just after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,' the user claimed.\n\nThe curious onlookers were mystified at the unidentified flying object as it did not appear to have any additional lights as they suspect most drones do.\n\n'My friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone,' the post adds.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border, on New Year's Day\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the user, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, then tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb\n\n'Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.'\n\nBright high-flying 'orange UFO orbs' have been spotted across the US in recent weeks with the most recent sighting surfacing over New York City.\n\nOn December 27, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video of the inexplicable luminous object to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s no secret that tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are making headlines with breakthrough generative AI tools that promise innovation at lightning speed. In just the last momth alone, OpenAI has launched several new updates with their \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event.\n\nYet, amidst this flurry of advancements, Apple has quietly charted its own path\u2014one rooted in privacy, security, and incremental progress.\n\nWhile some critics perceive Apple as lagging behind in the AI race, its measured approach could ultimately prove to be a strategic differentiator.\n\nA privacy-first approach to AI\n\n(Image credit: Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nApple\u2019s AI philosophy revolves around a core principle: privacy as a fundamental human right. Unlike competitors that leverage massive cloud-based datasets for AI processing, Apple prioritizes on-device machine learning wherever possible. This ensures that user data remains secure, and processed locally on devices such as iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\n\nFor example, AI features like text prediction, Face ID, and image recognition within the Photos app all function with minimal data leaving the device. Apple\u2019s voice assistant, Siri, also processes many tasks locally, a move designed to maintain user confidentiality.\n\nHowever, this dedication to privacy has its trade-offs. While competitors like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini harness extensive cloud resources to train advanced generative AI models, Apple\u2019s restricted data collection limits its ability to keep pace in certain AI developments.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook continues to emphasize the importance of trust. This steadfast focus on safeguarding user data sets Apple apart in an industry where data is often treated as a commodity.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Meanwhile, Siri, though reliable, is often viewed as less capable compared to newer, conversational AI models.\n\nYet, Apple has been integrating AI into its products for years, albeit subtly. Features like Night Mode on iPhone cameras, fall detection on the Apple Watch, and health insights in the Health app are all powered by AI. The company\u2019s emphasis on enhancing user experiences without drawing attention to the technology itself highlights a key distinction. Essentially, Apple prioritizes functionality over flash.\n\nNevertheless, as AI becomes a centerpiece of consumer technology, Apple\u2019s understated approach risks being overshadowed. Reports suggest the company has reorganized its AI division and ramped up investments, signaling a more aggressive push to close the gap with competitors.\n\nWhether Apple introduces its own generative AI tool remains to be seen, but the company\u2019s vast ecosystem and seamless hardware-software integration provide a unique foundation for future innovations.\n\nApple\u2019s vision\n\nWhile its competitors focus on generative AI for search engines, chatbots, and content creation, Apple\u2019s AI efforts are deeply tied to health and wellness. Tim Cook has repeatedly highlighted the Apple Watch as an example of technology that saves lives.\n\nAI powers features like irregular heart rhythm detection, fall alerts, and blood oxygen monitoring, underscoring Apple\u2019s mission to apply AI thoughtfully and meaningfully.\n\nIn other areas, AI is the unseen force behind Apple\u2019s celebrated user experiences. The iPhone\u2019s Photographic Styles and computational photography capabilities showcase AI\u2019s ability to transform everyday activities \u2014 like taking photos \u2014 into polished, professional results.\n\nBy embedding AI into these features, Apple reinforces its reputation for creating tools that are easy to use, reliable, and impactful.\n\nWhy Apple\u2019s strategy matters\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nApple\u2019s privacy-first approach resonates in an era where trust in tech companies is under constant scrutiny. Data breaches, unethical AI practices, and growing concerns over AI bias have made consumers more protective of their personal information.\n\nBy choosing trust and security over speed, Apple positions itself as a counterpoint to the industry\u2019s rush to dominate AI.\n\nThat said, Apple faces a fine line. While headlines highlight Apple's competitors nearly every day with the latest in AI technology, other headlines wonder why Apple hasn't caught up and wonder when or if the company ever will.\n\nDeliberate progress risks being perceived as stagnation, especially as competitors roll out high-profile AI features. For Apple to stay competitive, it will need to strike a balance: introducing AI advancements that capture public imagination while remaining true to its privacy commitments.\n\nLooking forward\n\nApple\u2019s methodical AI strategy may not make as many headlines, but it reflects a long-term vision as the tech industry navigates the ethical and practical implications of AI. Apple\u2019s cautious approach could pay off. Its focus on privacy, health, and enhancing user experiences aligns with a broader societal shift toward more responsible technology.\n\nIn the years ahead, Apple\u2019s challenge will be to innovate visibly without compromising its core values. Whether Apple can redefine AI\u2019s role in daily life or simply keep pace remains to be seen. One thing is clear: in prioritizing privacy and trust, Apple isn\u2019t just building technology\u2014it\u2019s building confidence in a digital world that desperately needs it."

            "article_content": "They\u2019re here, but they\u2019re \u201cdocile.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the description Chris Sanders, a paranormal investigator out of Phoenix, Arizona, uses when he describes the level of ghostly activities in Lockport.\n\nSanders is currently visiting Niagara County at a friend\u2019s house in Lockport, who is also subbing as a camera person for his jaunts into the unknown. They have been visiting the local hot spots of haunted encounters in the area. After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \u201chaunted houses\u201d Sanders then posts videos of the experience on to his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple of ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we\u2019ve done quite a few places,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander\u2019s visited such spots as Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \u201cintrigued\u201d by him than \u201caggressive\u201d Sanders said that was fine with him. He\u2019s still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of these places I\u2019ve done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they\u2019re more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I\u2019ve been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost-hunting places. Here in Lockport, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what\u2019s unknown \u2014 the big questions like, \u201cWhat happens when we die?\u201d \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There are millions of ghost-hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \u201cspirit dice,\u201d as well as white noise boxes and light-up \u201crem pods\u201d that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he\u2019s trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\u201cYou usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cA residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that\u2019s almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\u201cI walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014 but I asked them. I said, \u2018I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?\u2019 They all started laughing,\u201d he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \u201csomething\u201d in the attic.\n\n\u201cWe set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating, have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camerawoman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children who were haunting the second floor.\n\n\u201cShe was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \u201chaunted\u201d in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they\u2019re off (for more ghost hunting trips),\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nFew places in Hull are more packed with quirky sights and tales than General Cemetery.\n\nThe strange graveyard which runs alongside Spring Bank West is a bizarre place where the largely dilapidated headstones have been reclaimed by nature. There are even a couple of graves which have almost been swallowed up by tree trunks.\n\nThe land was developed as a cemetery in 1847 but the area has been left to become more of a wildlife haven in recent years. That has added to the mystique of the area.\n\nREAD MORE: Leeds United chief Daniel Farke gives Hull City verdict ahead of Yorkshire derby showdown\n\nREAD MORE: I try a Hull deli as I embark on a New Year's health kick - but get distracted by cake\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are the Quaker graves, the memorial to cholera victims and many strange tales behind the headstones. There are also plenty of fairy doors and other bizarre items if you look closely. But there is one tree which is truly curious.\n\nDeep in the grounds is the \"Penny Tree\", where hundreds of pennies are stuck to the trunk in long lines. The coins have been placed quite high up in the tree so you would need to be agile or have a ladder to get to them.\n\nThere are hundreds of the coins just below where the branches begin in a spiral form. But many of the coins appear to have been plucked out or have fallen out over time.\n\nThe Penny Tree in Hull General Cemetery\n\nAccording to this legend, anyone who climbs up and removes a penny will suffer bad luck. The story is a hoax, however, created by a local paranormal group and local artist Lee Sendall in the early 2000s who also etched a number of faces on some of the trees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther people have since used the tree to etch their own names and pictures into it. There are a number of faces and figures and even a dancing fairy.\n\nLee was also responsible for \u201cLittle Doug,\u201d a strange artefact put on display in Hull Maritime Museum in 2006. It looked like some alien foetus which was inspired by the mermaid exhibits of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe ''Little Doug'' exhibit by Lee Sendell at the Maritime Museum, Queen Victoria Square in Hull\n\nLee even created a back story to say it was brought over by a soldier from North Africa during the Second World War and was preserved by being buried in an allotment in Hull.\n\nHe is a colourful character who also threatened to sue the organisers of the London Olympics after claiming designs he submitted for an arts competition run by Olympics chiefs were ripped off by director of the opening ceremony Danny Boyle.\n\nHe submitted plans for a spiralled mound and a similar hill was then used in the opening ceremony which was supposedly based on Glastonbury Tor."

It was used to house criminals with severe mental illnesses.\n\nPsychopaths and those suffering from schizophrenia and depression were locked up, feared by staff and kept segregated in D Wing \u2014 which Dave described as a \u201chotspot\u201d for ghostly activity.\n\nCove Group, which has been managing the prison since 2017, struck a deal with the Ministry of Justice to buy the site after months of nail-biting negotiations.\n\nCEO Joel Campbell said: \"This marks the biggest step forward in our ten-year relationship with Shepton Mallet Prison.\n\n\"From our initial bid to buy it from the MoJ to the recent threat of closure, our dedication has never wavered.\"\n\nPrevious owners, City & Country, had been eyeing a controversial redevelopment plan that would have turned the prison into luxury flats and townhouses, along with a caf\u00e9 and \u2018community heritage spaces.\u2019\n\nThe news sparked outrage among locals and history buffs alike, leading to a massive backlash.\n\nBut Cove Group\u2019s acquisition has put those plans on ice.\n\nInstead, the group plans to invest heavily in the site, preserving its eerie charm and historical significance for future generations.\n\nCampbell added: \"This acquisition is not just about preserving history; it\u2019s about celebrating and revitalising it.\n\n\"We are overjoyed to embark on this journey of transformation, ensuring that Shepton Mallet Prison remains a beacon of heritage tourism for generations to come.\"\n\n4 Brave Sun reporter Nicola Agius joined parnormal Investigator Tony Ferguson at the prison in 2023 Credit: Sun Newspapers Ltd"

            "article_content": "The next big thing\n\nWe all know about large language models (LLMs) that are facilitating computers to generate and process big data, enabling them to respond to natural language questions. But now, small language models (SLMs), which have the capability to generate human-like language and are trained on datasets that are limited, are also becoming all the rage. It is understood that they can be trained and used easily, besides being more cost-effective and using less computational power, making them ideal for specific tasks. Big tech giants Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and others are investing billions in developing general-purpose LLMs to handle a variety of tasks, but they might not be able to be customised for certain needs. They may require a smaller version of generative AI. Infosys chief technology officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar was recently quoted as saying that several small language models for India-specific needs have already been launched and with a growing developer base, a lot more GenAI applications will be implemented for Indian and global markets. Last year saw several launches of lightweight models such as Microsoft\u2019s Phi family of SLMs, Google\u2019s Gemma and a smaller variant of Meta\u2019s Llama model. Microsoft\u2019s Sundar Srinivasan was also quoted as saying that while LLMs have pushed the boundaries of accuracy across various AI tasks throughout 2024, SLMs have driven mass adoption and true democratisation of AI. Industry experts are certainly looking at SLMs as the next big thing in AI.\n\nA godfather\u2019s warning\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian computer scientist who is referred to as the \u2018godfather\u2019 of AI, has raised an alarm that the technology may lead to human extinction in the next 30 years, with a 10-20% chance of that happening. Hinton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics earlier in 2024 for his contributions to AI. In an interview to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he was quoted as saying that we\u2019ve never had to deal with things more intelligent than ourselves before discussing his evolving views on AI\u2019s potential risks. He says that the likelihood of AI causing harm has risen in recent times. \u201cAnd how many examples do you know of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing? There are very few examples. There\u2019s a mother and baby. Evolution put a lot of work into allowing the baby to control the mother, but that\u2019s about the only example I know of,\u201d he had said conceding on a previous account that he wished he\u2019d thought about safety earlier \u2013 alluding to his apprehension about the potential for AI to ramp up the arms race. Hinton has been speaking about the potential dangers of unregulated AI development after he resigned from Google in 2023. He made headlines when he left Google and raised alarms of the repercussions of machines such as AI that could one day outsmart people, adding that there is also the possibility of some bad actors exploiting AI for destructive purposes.\n\nGemini vs OpenAI\n\nThe rivalry between Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft-backed OpenAI has been escalating. According to reports, Google is set to build business and focus on Gemini AI for customers in 2025, amidst rivalry with OpenAI. As reported, its contractors are using an internal platform for comparing Gemini\u2019s outputs to those of other AI models and are relying on Claude, a family of large language models developed by Anthropic, to improve the responses provided by its own AI model. TechCrunch reported that Google contractors are given responses generated by Gemini and Claude in response to a user prompt which they have to rate within 30 minutes on factors such as truthfulness and verbosity. Meanwhile, Google recently unveiled the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model in competition with OpenAI. In its blog, Google said that it is their \u201cmost capable model yet\u201d. \u201cWith new advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,\u201d Google said. Additionally, it launched a new feature called \u2018Deep Research\u2019, which is capable of using \u201cadvanced reasoning and long context capabilities to act as a research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports\u201d, available for Gemini\u2019s advanced subscribers.\n\nAlso Read Former PM Manmohan Singh passes away at 92 Volkswagen Golf GTI to launch in India next year Zelio Ebikes launches e-rickshaws Tanga Butterfly and Tanga SS starting at Rs 1.40 lakh Axis Max Life Insurance launches Sustainable Wealth 50 Index Fund \u2013 Should you invest?\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, too, has unveiled new o3 and o3 mini models, which will be launched later this year. The new models are quite advanced versions and much better than its predecessors in several performance benchmarks, as per reports.\n\nAI in Mahakumbh\n\nAs AI is increasingly becoming pervasive, why should Mahakumbh be left behind? In line with the advancing tech, the Uttar Pradesh government has planned to use AI-enabled cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) wristbands and mobile app tracking to track the headcount of pilgrims at the upcoming religious carnival. Starting in Prayagraj on January 13, approximately 450 million devotees are likely to attend Mahakumbh, which is recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The government will also launch a dedicated website and app, an AI-powered chatbot in 11 languages, QR code-based passes for people and vehicles, and a multilingual digital lost-and-found centre for visitors."

            "article_content": "Understanding community safety through accurate crime data helps residents make informed decisions about where to live and work. Law enforcement experts and data analysts provide several reliable methods for accessing and interpreting local crime statistics, emphasizing the importance of using official sources for accurate information.\n\nOfficial data sources\n\nLocal police departments serve as primary sources for accurate crime information. Most departments maintain public websites featuring detailed crime reports categorized by neighborhood or zip code. These resources typically include annual reports, current crime statistics, and specific details about homicides and other violent crimes within their jurisdictions.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies often provide sections labeled \u201cCrime Statistics\u201d or \u201cAnnual Reports\u201d on their websites. These comprehensive documents include detailed information about homicides, property crimes, and arrests within specific timeframes, allowing residents to track patterns and trends in their areas.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Crime Data Explorer provides comprehensive nationwide statistics. This federal database allows users to filter information by location and specific crime types, offering valuable insights into local safety patterns and trends over time. The platform\u2019s design enables detailed analysis of murder rates and other violent crimes across different regions.\n\nCity resources\n\nMany metropolitan areas maintain public crime dashboards that display current statistics. These platforms often provide interactive maps and regular updates about criminal activities within specific neighborhoods. City officials emphasize the importance of these tools for maintaining community awareness and safety.\n\nThese dashboards typically offer real-time or near-real-time updates, allowing residents to monitor recent criminal activities in their areas. Many systems include features for comparing crime rates across different neighborhoods or zip codes, providing valuable context for understanding local safety conditions.\n\nThird-party platforms\n\nSeveral independent organizations aggregate crime data into user-friendly formats. NeighborhoodScout compiles information from multiple sources to create detailed safety profiles for specific areas. The platform includes crime rates, risk indexes, and comparative analysis tools that help residents understand their neighborhood\u2019s safety level.\n\nCrimeMapping.com utilizes official police data to generate interactive maps showing recent criminal activities. Users can customize searches to focus specifically on homicides or other violent crimes within their zip codes. The platform provides regular updates and historical data for comprehensive analysis.\n\nSpotCrime offers another valuable resource, featuring interactive maps highlighting recent crimes, including violent offenses. The platform allows users to set up alerts for real-time updates about criminal activities in their areas, helping residents stay informed about potential safety concerns.\n\nUnderstanding statistics\n\nCrime analysts emphasize the importance of proper data interpretation. Population size significantly affects crime rates, particularly in smaller communities where few incidents can dramatically impact statistical representations. Experts recommend examining murder rates calculated per 100,000 residents while considering the community\u2019s total population for context.\n\nLaw enforcement experts recommend examining trends over extended periods, typically five to ten years, rather than focusing on isolated incidents or short-term fluctuations. This longitudinal approach provides more accurate insights into community safety patterns and helps identify meaningful trends in violent crime rates.\n\nContextual analysis\n\nSecurity specialists stress the importance of comparing local statistics with surrounding areas. This broader perspective helps residents better understand their neighborhood\u2019s relative safety within the larger community context. Experts recommend evaluating multiple adjacent zip codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of regional safety patterns.\n\nCrime prevention experts note that not all incidents appear in official records. Understanding these limitations helps residents make more informed decisions about their safety and security measures. They emphasize the importance of using multiple data sources to create a more complete picture of local safety conditions.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nLaw enforcement officials encourage resident participation in safety initiatives. Many police departments host regular community meetings to discuss crime trends and prevention strategies. These gatherings provide opportunities for direct interaction with local law enforcement and often include detailed discussions of recent criminal activities and prevention efforts.\n\nNeighborhood watch programs often maintain additional crime tracking resources. These community-based initiatives frequently offer detailed insights into local safety concerns and prevention efforts, complementing official data sources with ground-level observations and reports.\n\nDigital resources\n\nModern technology provides various tools for staying informed about local crime. Many communities use alert systems like Nixle to share real-time updates about criminal activities and safety concerns. These platforms often allow users to customize notifications based on location and crime type.\n\nSocial media platforms have become increasingly important for tracking local safety information. Law enforcement agencies regularly use these channels to communicate with residents about ongoing investigations, safety concerns, and crime prevention strategies.\n\nPractical applications\n\nUnderstanding local crime statistics supports various decision-making processes:\n\nInformed decision-making becomes crucial when relocating or choosing schools. Property owners can implement appropriate security measures based on specific crime patterns in their areas. Community organizations can develop targeted safety initiatives addressing local concerns.\n\nMoving forward\n\nAccessing and understanding local crime statistics represents an important step toward community safety. Regular monitoring of crime data helps residents stay informed about safety trends while enabling proactive participation in local crime prevention efforts.\n\nThis knowledge empowers residents to make informed choices about their safety while contributing to broader community security initiatives. Through consistent monitoring and engagement with available resources, community members can work together to create safer neighborhoods for everyone.\n\nThis story was created using AI technology."

As traders grapple with this bearish trend, many are turning their attention to innovative alternatives that promise safer returns.\n\nAmong these alternatives, RCO Finance (RCOF), an upcoming AI altcoin, is emerging as an option of hope for investors seeking stability and significant returns from the previous losses from the Ethereum price drop.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Extended Losses Below Key Support Levels\n\nThe Ethereum price has continued, plunging below the critical $3,550 threshold and sparking investor concerns. The altcoin has not regained momentum, trading well below $3,500, with bearish resistance at $3,420 on the hourly ETH/USD chart.\n\nThis downward trajectory has intensified, with the coin touching intraday lows near $3,100 and consolidating losses around $3,300.\n\nThe Ethereum price trading below its 100-hour Simple Moving Average reinforces the bearish sentiment, indicating a clear lack of upward pressure. Key resistance levels remain at $3,350 and $3,420, with support zones at $3,120 and $3,050.\n\nA breach below $3,050 could push the Ethereum price into uncharted bearish territory, potentially testing the $2,880 level.\n\nAs Ethereum struggles to recover, traders are eyeing alternative investment opportunities like RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin with the potential to deliver more stable and lucrative returns in a volatile market.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF): The RIsing DeFi Gem\n\nIn response to the Ethereum price volatility, investors are turning their attention to AI altcoins, like RCO Finance (RCOF), which integrate artificial intelligence to improve financial services and investment strategies. This approach democratizes access to advanced trading strategies and empowers investors to make informed decisions in an increasingly complex market.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This sophisticated tool analyzes historical price data, current market trends, and relevant news events to craft personalized investment strategies tailored to individual user profiles.\n\nThe Robo Advisor continuously adapts to market conditions and minimizes human error and emotional biases that often plague traditional trading methods. This personalization level assures that novice and experienced investors can confidently make trades without worrying about market\u2019s volatility.\n\nAdditionally, RCO Finance employs Automated Market Making (AMM) technology, which automates the trading process entirely. This feature allows for swift transactions without manual execution, significantly reducing users\u2019 time and effort. RCOF optimizes liquidity provision and improves yield generation by leveraging AI and machine learning.\n\nAnother key feature that distinguishes RCO Finance is its focus on real-world asset integration and tokenization. Bridging the gap between digital currencies and tangible assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, RCOF enables users to invest in over 120,000 asset classes without the hassle of converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currency.\n\nThis flawless integration opens up a world of investment opportunities previously inaccessible to many traders, allowing them to build diversified portfolios that align with their financial goals.\n\nSecurity is also a paramount concern for RCO Finance. The platform employs robust security protocols, including multi-signature wallets and decentralized governance mechanisms, to safeguard users\u2019 assets against potential threats.\n\nAdditionally, the platform employs a no KYC policy, allowing investors to engage in the platform without disclosing personal information for verification. The RCOF token smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof to guarantee the safety and integrity of the assets.\n\nWhy Join the RCOF AI Altcoin Presale Now!\n\nFor those looking to capitalize on this rising DeFi gem, now is the perfect time to get involved in the ongoing RCO Finance (RCOF) AI altcoin presale. With an initial price starting at just $0.077, early investors have access to an additional 25% of AI altcoins off their purchase using the code RCOF25.\n\nInvestors can expect even more value as the next presale stage sees prices rise to $0.0777. Projections suggest that RCOF could reach prices between $0.4 and $0.6 upon its official launch on exchanges. Due to the growth of the AI altcoin sector, these figures are expected to rise to over $1 post-presale.\n\nMoreover, holding RCOF tokens grants access to community rewards exceeding $100,000 and provides governance rights within the platform. Holders also have benefits such as staking rewards with unmatched APYs exceeding 88%, trading discounts of up to 40%, and quarterly dividends.\n\nAs the Ethereum price faces bearish trends and market volatility, RCO Finance\u2019s AI-powered platform and the ongoing RCOF AI altcoin presale offer investors a promising alternative for secure and potentially lucrative returns. Take this early opportunity and invest in the presale before time runs out.\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale:\n\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\n\nJoin The RCO Finance Community"

            "article_content": "Luiz Rocha was scuba diving 460 feet beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean when a flash caught his eye: a small damselfish with big eyes, perched on a colorful reef.\n\nRocha, a scientist and curator at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, thought the fish was so unusual that it might actually be an undiscovered species. Two years later, he was able to confirm his suspicions with a team of researchers, and described his find in a paper published last month.\n\nThe damselfish, officially Chromis abadhah, is one of 138 animals, fungi and plants from around the world that Academy of Sciences researchers confirmed as new discoveries in 2024. They include 31 other fishes, dozens of bugs, an endangered dahlia, two deep-water ghost sharks, and a striped spider from Madagascar. The Academy is just one of many institutions globally that document new species.\n\nThese new-to-science specimens were spotted by scientists like Rocha in their habitats on several continents and in the waters around them and confirmed in a long, scientific process called \u201cdescription.\u201d\n\nScientists who discover new species have the honor of naming them. This year\u2019s list includes a \u201cplant bug\u201d named after outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris: Pseudoloxops kamalaharrisae, a yellow creature with long antennae found in French Polynesia. Another bug was named for actor Harrison Ford. Academy researcher Brad Balukjian, who co-discovered both, said in a news release that he wanted to honor the politician\u2019s and celebrity\u2019s commitments to conservation and climate science.\n\nShannon Bennett, a virologist and chief of science at the Academy, said the discoveries speak to humanity\u2019s responsibility to catalog and conserve Earth\u2019s rich biodiversity. Species are being snuffed out because of human activity at a terrifying rate \u2014 so fast that scientists call this era a \u201cmass extinction,\u201d like the asteroid that took out dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\n\u201cYou cannot care about what you don\u2019t know about,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nScientists estimate that they\u2019ve discovered just one-tenth of the planet\u2019s species, Bennett said. Typically, researchers come across new creatures while examining something else. That\u2019s how Rocha came across the sleek damselfish two years ago.\n\nAn expert in deep-water scuba diving, Rocha trekked to the Maldives, a tiny island country in the Indian Ocean, to survey its deep reefs.\n\nThese colorful bands of coral lie at depths between 100 feet and 500 feet and, like many of the world\u2019s deep reefs, had never been seen by humans, Rocha said.\n\nWater filters enough light at that depth that divers call it the \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d But the distinctive damselfish, white-and-blue hued with elegant fins, caught Rocha\u2019s eye.\n\nRocha snapped a photo and returned the next day. Because the fish were abundant, he collected four specimens for later study. It was a long journey, and the fish did not survive. Rocha could only spend eight minutes at that depth to save enough time for a four-hour ascent to the surface, rising slowly to avoid a dangerous buildup of gases known as \u201cthe bends.\u201d\n\nRocha had a hunch that the species was new to science but needed confirmation. What followed was a lengthy process, in which he and a team of Academy researchers studied the fish\u2019s traits and compared them to others. The results were published in the peer-reviewed journal ZooKeys.\n\nTo name the fish, Rocha collaborated with Maldivian locals and settled on a name in a local tongue: \u201cabadhah,\u201d which translates as \u201cperpetual.\u201d Rocha wants the species and its colorful habitat to be everlasting, he said, and he hopes the name will inspire conservation efforts. Even though humans had never before laid eyes on the deep reef where he found the damselfish, the signs of over-fishing, plastics and pollution were obvious, Rocha said.\n\nOther water-dwelling animals confirmed as new discoveries this year include a goby found in Bali, Indonesia, that resides in giant sponges; a slew of marine worms; eerie ghost sharks that live at deep depths; and a tiny pipehorse the size of a golf tee found in South Africa.\n\nOn land, the discoveries include a brilliantly colored dahlia in the Mexican state of Oaxaca that\u2019s critically endangered \u2014 a rare distinction \u2014 and a 100-million-year-old fossil of a skink \u2014 a kind of lizard \u2014 that was preserved in amber in Myanmar.\n\nBennett said that the rate of confirmations this year is about average. She expects \u201cmany, many more\u201d in 2025."

Just tap the + button or paste the image into the entry bar,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new update puts Grok on par with other industry-leading AI tools, including OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 (which uses ChatGPT for image generation), Meta\u2019s AI assistant (available on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, offering text and image generation), and Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 (capable of generating images, audio, and text).\n\nxAI previously tested the waters with image generation by introducing a tool called \u201cAurora\u201d within Grok in November 2024, however, the feature was removed after its brief launch.\n\nSince its debut in November 2023, Grok has seen rapid growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially exclusive to X premium users, the AI assistant became available to non-premium users in December 2024 with some restrictions.\n\nFree users are now able to make up to 10 queries every two hours, along with access to limited image analysis features, while premium and premium+ subscribers enjoy increased access, including up to 50 daily queries.\n\nIn November 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that Grok\u2019s valuation reached $50 billion, while Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO), described Musk\u2019s chatbot as a \u201cserious competitor\u201d a month later."

            "article_content": "Such searches may also reveal new types of variable stars: free-floating planets which fled their host stars and perhaps even rare classes of supernova. Looking for weird anomalies can also reveal problems with the instruments we are using, which is extremely important. We don\u2019t want to claim to find something exciting and it turns out to be a faulty camera!\n\nThe work I am carrying out with my colleagues uses machine learning to help astronomers reveal unknowns lurking in their data. In the coming new era of astronomy, there is going to be an incredible amount of data; no human can ever get through this data on their own. For example, the Vera C Rubin Observatory, which is soon to open for science, will produce 20 terabytes (20,000 gigabytes) of data every night! We hope that machine learning can help us to find and recommend what objects an astronomer should spend their time looking at and examining in more detail.\n\nThe Vera C Rubin Observatory is one of the most exciting projects in astronomy right now. It is named after one of the greats of the field, Vera Rubin, who provided some of the best evidence for dark matter, the ever-elusive matter that permeates the universe but which scientists still have yet to directly detect. Rubin will snap the observable night sky in its entirety every three nights, repeating this three-day cycle for 10 years, night-to-night, using the largest camera ever made.\n\nWhat Rubin is looking for is differences in images it has previously taken; like the largest game of spot the difference you could ever imagine, built-up into a 10-year video. Over its lifetime, Rubin will take 500 petabytes (500 million gigabytes) worth of images \u2013 which is enough to fill close to four million iPhones. It promises to be one of the best movies ever produced (at least for astronomers!).\n\nEach night Rubin will alert astronomers to 10 million changes in the sky. The changes detected in images are objects like asteroids \u2013 Rubin will find more than has ever been recorded \u2013 or variable stars that change in brightness during their lifetimes, and supernovae, the extreme and violent explosions of stars in the last moments of their lives. It will also do many other things, especially in helping our understanding of dark matter and mapping the contents of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nMachine learning can give great insights into the data scientists are interested in, but it is the scientist who must decide what to do next. But I don\u2019t think the use of machine learning has been maximised.\n\nThere are many possible futures and excitingly, the tools for future searches are currently being built. There are large spectroscopic telescopes in preparation like the dryly named Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). These telescopes can analyse the light from planets and determine the makeup of their atmospheres and have the potential to reveal biosignatures \u2013 tracers of life \u2013 in the atmospheres of these planets.\n\nNaturally, some researchers are interested in finding even more sophisticated compounds that cannot arise from nature which would be a sure sign of something interesting brewing in these distant worlds.\n\nThere are also new radio telescopes being built, including the impressive Square Kilometre Array, which will be of great interest to researchers looking for interesting radio signals, natural or not, and Breakthrough Listen are preparing the next generation of hardware and algorithms on new telescopes to continue the search for life.\n\nI have always been interested in astronomy, and the challenge of looking for the most unusual and interesting objects in the universe was an offer I could hardly refuse.\n\nWhen I look at a starry sky, I tend to wonder. I look at the planets shining brightly, without wavering through our atmosphere, and I think about how Jupiter must look with its magnificent moons. I see the fast-moving satellites above and think about all the important stuff up there including astronauts, communications and telescopes, and the ingenuity it took to get it there.\n\nI watch the stars flicker and imagine what life would be like around them, likely they are something unimaginably different from what we know, but perhaps there are places that resemble our own world. For astronomers, the lofty goal of understanding the universe can be the most humbling of pursuits, and it always starts by looking up.\n\nDo you have a story to tell or opinions to share about this?

Source: Khartoum State Government/Handout via Reuters.\n\nSudan\u2019s army chief has welcomed a Turkish offer to resolve the brutal 20-month conflict between his forces and their paramilitary rivals, the Sudanese foreign minister said.\n\nIn early December, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a phone call with Sudan\u2019s Abdel Fattah al-Burhan that Ankara could help establish \u201cpeace and stability\u201d in the war-torn African state.\n\nAt a meeting in Port Sudan on Saturday, Burhan asked Turkey\u2019s deputy foreign minister Burhanettin Duran to \u201cdeliver the Sudanese leadership\u2019s welcoming of the initiative\u201d to Erdogan, Sudanese foreign minister Ali Youssef said in a briefing after the meeting.\n\n\u201cSudan needs brothers and friends like Turkey,\u201d Youssef said, adding that \u201cthe initiative can lead to\u2026 realising peace in Sudan\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErdogan said in his December call with Burhan that Turkey \u201ccould step in to resolve disputes\u201d between Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, and prevent Sudan from \u201cbecoming an area of external interventions\u201d, according to a statement from the Turkish presidency.\n\nSudan\u2019s army-backed government has repeatedly accused the UAE of supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 claims echoed by outside analysts, which the UAE has consistently denied.\n\nLast month, the Sudanese government accused the RSF of launching UAE-assembled drones from neighbouring Chad.\n\nUS lawmakers long critical of the Gulf power\u2019s role quoted the White House as saying late last month that the UAE had told the United States it would not arm paramilitaries in Sudan\u2019s war.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Burhan on Saturday, Turkey\u2019s Duran said that the peace process \u201centails concerted efforts\u201d, and that his country was ready to play a \u201crole in mobilising other regional actors to help overcoming the difficulties in ending this conflict\u201d.\n\nIn a statement last week, the UAE welcomed \u201cdiplomatic efforts\u201d by Turkey to \u201cresolve the ongoing crisis in Sudan\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe UAE is fully prepared to cooperate and coordinate with the Turkish efforts and all diplomatic initiatives to end the conflict in Sudan and find a comprehensive solution to the crisis,\u201d its foreign ministry said.\n\nThe war in Sudan, which has pitted Burhan against his former deputy and RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted 12 million more.\n\nIt has also pushed the country to the brink of famine, with analysts warning involvement from other countries will only prolong the suffering.\n\nAdvertisement"

New data reported in the past few days indicate that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Mr. Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been."

            "article_content": "Despite some episodic spikes here and there, the economy of Bangladesh is still struggling, and the government isn't sure what the top priority should be. Businesses are under pressure as inflation rises beyond 9 percent and GDP growth slows to 5.2 percent in FY24 with further downward trend.\n\nAs we know, family-run and promoter-led firms dominate the Bangladesh economy, especially in the textile, export and manufacturing industries. Nearly 4 million people work in the readymade garment industry alone. Many company leaders/owners have been put behind bars or are absconding due to recent upheavals, which have interrupted operations and made decision-making more time-consuming. Further degradation will cause closures, pay reductions, and rapid layoffs.\n\nIn response to similar problems, nations like Vietnam and India offered financial aid and tax breaks to save domestic companies. But Bangladesh rather eliminated incentives and reportedly raising taxes, which may make recovery far more challenging.\n\nWhat's at stake if large companies fail?\n\nThe collapse of large companies would shock Bangladesh's job market. Over 80 percent of formal occupations are directly or indirectly related to these companies. Layoffs will cause families to experience immediate financial instability and income loss.\n\nNot only the manufacturing industry but also transporters, raw material suppliers, port personnel, and logistics providers would all see a sharp drop in business, which would result in a large number of job losses. The loss of jobs in the unorganised sector, which is heavily reliant on the spending power of those in corporate occupations, would make poverty worse.\n\nThe economy as a whole will suffer from a deteriorating labour market. As incomes decline, consumer spending will also decline, which will force more businesses to shut down or scale back operations. There will be more protests and strikes, which will lead to higher unemployment rates and more instability in society. Similar periods of political and economic instability have been experienced by nations like Pakistan and Sri Lanka as a result of delayed interventions. Bangladesh is unable to afford to take the same path.\n\nWhat the government must do now\n\nLarge companies and promoters need immediate breathing space to survive. The government must step in with low-interest loans, deferred taxes, and grace periods for repayments. Vietnam saved thousands of businesses this way. Bangladesh must act similarly to prevent layoffs and closures. Investment incentives must also be restored to attract capital and revive confidence in economic zones that are now stagnant.\n\nThe workforce needs skill development badly. Mismatched skills keep 40 percent of graduates unemployed. The 'Skill India' mission trained millions and increased employment. Bangladesh must duplicate such initiatives to prepare its workers.\n\nReviving clothing export orders necessitates careful attention. Simplifying trade regulations, offering export incentives, and lowering transportation costs can all help. Vietnam invested $1.2 billion in textiles to compete; Bangladesh must do the same or risk falling behind.\n\nEqually important is simplifying regulations. Endless red tape slows corporate growth and hiring. To grow and stabilise employment, the government must streamline processes.\n\nA last chance to act\n\nBangladesh's large companies don't just create jobs -- they sustain entire ecosystems. If these companies collapse, millions of jobs will vanish, poverty rates will spike, and social unrest will escalate. Countries like Vietnam and India acted fast to prevent such outcomes with bold interventions. Bangladesh, however, risks falling further behind if it continues to delay action.\n\nThe time for hesitation is over. The government must step up with financial support, regulatory reforms, and investment incentives to protect jobs and stabilise corporations. Employment must be prioritised to prevent economic disaster and ensure Bangladesh's long-term recovery. Reconstituting boards or temporarily releasing funds to ailing banks would not help. Business continuity, including corporate and large loan restructuring for distressed companies, is key here. Policy makers need to think beyond and act sensibly.\n\nThe author is chairman of Financial Excellence Ltd"

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nSomething to look forward to: Since AMD introduced its Ryzen 9000 series and Strix Point Ryzen AI processors, users have been eagerly anticipating other members of the Zen 5 family, such as Ryzen AI Max and Fire Range. Now, ECS has become the first manufacturer to confirm plans to unveil a product featuring AMD's mainstream-focused Krackan Point chips at CES 2025.\n\nECS is set to showcase the first laptop featuring AMD's upcoming Krackan Point APUs at CES 2025. AMD has already confirmed that Krackan Point is designed to offer a low-cost entry point into Microsoft's Copilot+ PC standard, positioning it to compete with Intel's Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V series.\n\nThe processor powering the ECS UP42KP laptop is likely the Ryzen AI 7 350. The manufacturer's description matches the rumored specifications of this chip, which include four Zen 5 cores, four Zen 5c cores, an integrated GPU with eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, and an XDNA 2 NPU capable of 40 TOPs \u2013 meeting the threshold required for Copilot.\n\nWith a TDP ranging from 15W to 54W, the 14-inch 1080p laptop supports DDR5-5600 RAM, 16 PCIe lanes, Wi-Fi 6, HDMI 2.1, and USB 4. It also supports Windows Hello via an IR camera with a privacy shutter. While the release date and pricing details remain unclear, AMD aims for Krackan Point devices to retail for under $800.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 7 350 is the most powerful Krackan Point APU announced so far, but a lower-tier version \u2013 the AI 5 340 \u2013 was spotted on Geekbench last November. This cheaper variant will maintain the AI 7 350's NPU performance but feature three Zen 5 cores, three Zen 5c cores, and a Radeon 840M iGPU with four RDNA 3.5 CUs.\n\nKrackan Point sits just below Strix Point in AMD's Zen 5 lineup. Since its debut late last year, Strix Point APUs, such as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375, have started appearing in the latest handheld gaming PCs. Lenovo is expected to unveil a device featuring the Z2 Extreme variant at CES.\n\nRyzen AI Max, featuring up to 16 Zen 5 cores and 40 RDNA 3.5 CUs, is the next step up. A benchmark of an engineering sample was recently spotted running on an upcoming high-end 2-in-1 notebook from Asus.\n\nUsers are also eagerly awaiting the launch of AMD's Fire Range, the company's most powerful Zen 5 laptop processors. A recent Geekbench AI test suggests they will debut in Asus' 2025 ROG Strix G-series laptops.\n\nIn the desktop sector, AMD is also set to unveil new Ryzen 9000 X3D CPUs this month. TechSpot recently named last year's 9800X3D the best gaming CPU, and it has outpaced all of its non-X3D counterparts in sales at Mindfactory.\n\nThe new ECS Krackan Point laptop will be accompanied by a new Snapdragon X Plus notebook, a mini PC, and new Intel motherboards."

            "article_content": "Another mysterious 'orange UFO orb' was spotted flying over the US, however, this time the inexplicable glow was seen conspicuously hovering over a military base in Tennessee.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border - on New Year's Day.\n\nThe user, who witnessed the perplexing 'celestial' event alongside their father, who is a seasoned Army veteran, said that they 'couldn't explain' what they were seeing in the skies above.\n\n'My dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before,' the post reads.\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the Redditor, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb.\n\n'Just after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,' the user claimed.\n\nThe curious onlookers were mystified at the unidentified flying object as it did not appear to have any additional lights as they suspect most drones do.\n\n'My friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone,' the post adds.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border, on New Year's Day\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the user, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, then tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb\n\n'Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.'\n\nBright high-flying 'orange UFO orbs' have been spotted across the US in recent weeks with the most recent sighting surfacing over New York City.\n\nOn December 27, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video of the inexplicable luminous object to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "A new breakthrough may help scientists solve some of the mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nFor the first time, physicists have been able to measure the geometrical 'shape' a lone electron adopts as it moves through a solid. It's an achievement that will unlock a whole new way of studying how crystalline solids behave on a quantum level.\n\n\"We've essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn't be obtained before,\" says physicist Riccardo Comin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research was led by physicists Mingu Kang \u2013 formerly of MIT and now at Cornell University \u2013 and Sunjie Kim of Seoul National University.\n\nWithin the physical Universe, matter behaves in ways that are well described by classical physics.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level of particle interactions and methods of measurement, things can get a little weird. On the finest of scales, precision must give way to a more fuzzy description represented by waves of possibility known as quantum mechanics.\n\nWe refer to objects like electrons as particles, and that conveys the impression that they are like teeny tiny little balls. Given their size, the properties and behaviors of electrons are far more accurately described by their wave-like quantum nature.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo describe the wave aspect of electrons, physicists use wave functions: mathematical models that describe the properties of the wave as evolving possibilities of finding the particle in a specific place with specific features.\n\nSome of these features we can think of as a kind of geometry, often not unlike a curve or sphere that rotates in an infinite number of directions. Other forms of quantum geometry, like those of electrons in a lattice of atoms, are as complicated as a Klein bottle or a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nDetermining some aspects of the messy quantum geometry of an electron in a solid has previously involved a lot of guesswork based on properties that physicists can measure.\n\nTo measure the quantum geometry of electrons, Kang, Jie, and their colleagues sought the measurement of a property known as the quantum geometric tensor, or QGT. This is a physical quantity that encodes the entire geometric information of a quantum state, similar to the way a two-dimensional hologram encodes information about a three-dimensional space.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe technique they used is called angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in which photons are fired at a material to dislodge electrons and measure their properties, such as polarization, spin, and angle.\n\nTheoretical (j, m) and real (k, l) measurements of quantum geometry. (Kang et al., Nat. Phys., 2024)\n\nThis was directed at single crystals of a cobalt-tin alloy, a material known as a kagome metal \u2013 a quantum material whose properties the team had previously investigated using the same technique.\n\nThe results provided the researchers with the first measurement of the QGT in a solid, and from this, they were able to infer the rest of the quantum geometry of the electrons in the metal.\n\nThe team compared this to theoretically derived quantum geometry for the same material, allowing them to determine the usefulness of estimating the geometry compared to measuring it directly.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, they say, their technique will be applicable to a broad range of materials, not just the cobalt-tin alloy used for this study. It's a result that will have some interesting implications. For example, quantum geometry could be leveraged to discover superconductivity in materials where it is not usually found.\n\n\"The geometric interpretation of quantum mechanics underpins many recent advances in condensed-matter physics,\" an anonymous expert told Nature Physics.\n\n\"These authors have pioneered a methodology to experimentally access the quantum geometric tensor, which fundamentally characterizes the geometric properties of quantum states. The developed methodology is straightforward, applicable to various solid-state materials, and has great potential for boosting experimental activity in pursuit of geometric understanding of novel quantum phenomena.\"\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Physics.\n\nRelated News"

While the admission fee for the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) exam has been reduced to Tk200, it is unacceptable that students are being charged an application fee of Tk1,200.\"\n\n\"We urged the university administration to reduce all types of fees as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nMohammad Shakil, a student from the Department of Sociology, said \"The discrimination we aimed to eliminate for a fairer society has not ended. The main goal of the July Movement was to properly assess merit, but quotas continue to take precedence over merit. This contradicts the very spirit of the July Revolution.\"\n\nHe added, 'Only quotas for backward communities should remain, but the students admitted under the meritorious quota mostly come from highly educated and wealthy families. This is extreme discrimination, and it is an insult to the martyrs of the July Revolution.'\"\n\nKiran Hawlader, a student from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Polymer Science, said: \"We have been demanding a reduction in application, admission, semester, and credit fees for a long time.\"\n\n\"Although the university administration has given assurances, no action has been taken so far.\"\n\n\"We are warning that we should not have to take to the streets to resolve issues that can be settled through dialogue,\" Kiran added.\n\nThe protesters have called for the postponement of the application process, which is scheduled to begin on 5 January, until the fees are revised."
