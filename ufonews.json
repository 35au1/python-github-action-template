            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "2024 was another fabulous year for video game releases, and indie games truly shined all year long. This is normally the time when we\u2019d list our top 10 indies, and we do just that below. However, we also don\u2019t believe this year could be confined to a measly 10 games, even in indies. That\u2019s why we included 14 more.\n\nShacknews Top 24 Indies, 24 - 11\n\n24. Little Kitty, Big City\n\n23. Felvidek\n\n22. Card-en-Ciel\n\n19. Kamikaze Lassplanes\n\n19. Fields of Mistria\n\n19. Luma Island\n\n18. Isles of Sea and Sky\n\n17. Slitterhead\n\n16. Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore\n\n15. Thank Goodness You're Here!\n\n14. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes\n\n13. 1000xRESIST\n\n12. Tales of Kenzara: ZAU\n\n11. Penny's Big Breakaway\n\nCongrats to those that made our list, even if they couldn\u2019t be in the Top 10. Voting was tight this year and many of these games are that splendid and were hotly contested! Each of them is well worth a check if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t played them yet, so we wish them all congrats for launching this year. Without further ado. It\u2019s time to move on to Shacknews Top 10 Indie Games of 2024. Here they are:\n\n10. Crow Country\n\nThere's a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in 90s horror games, and it's quite special how the team behind Crow Country managed to perfectly capture not only the look, but the vibe and feel of those games with this year's indie horror hit.\n\nCrow Country dials up scares without an excessive use of jump scares or other cheap tactics. Instead, SFB Games uses atmosphere to unsettle its players. From the music and sound design to bizarre creature models, Crow Country nestles itself deep under your skin.\n\nThe mystery of Crow Country was fodder for countless YouTubers this year as the community collaborated to piece together the clues laid out by SFB Games. It takes a special kind of game to foster that sort of community, and Crow Country is an excellent ambassador for the indie horror space.\n\nCrow Country is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.\n\n9. The Axis Unseen\n\nThere was little doubt that Nate Purkeypile was going to give us a game to remember from the moment he revealed The Axis Unseen because regardless of where you stand on indies, first-person games, or survival games, this one is an incredible concept: A heavy metal-inspired survival game where you wander the wilderness with a bow, arrows, and supernatural powers as you hunt cryptids and they often hunt you in turn.\n\nPurkeypile came out of the gate looking all sorts of ambitious with this one. He was an early adopter of Unreal Engine 5 in the indie game dev community, and it was clear from early on how much UE5's streamlined asset creation and specialized tools were a boon to the experienced environmental designer. The Axis Unseen's wilderness is rich and wicked, featuring a vast forest full of hills, mountains, and creatures to discover.\n\nThe Axis Unseen's creature design is also on point. It starts with small, mostly benign critters that will really only attack you if you attack them. However, it's not long before you running into tree giants that can impale you with thorny branches and intense Bigfoot creatures that can beat your brains in a jiffy if they catch you. The smart use of your arrows and the powers you can imbue into them is the only way you stand a chance.\n\nWhen it came to 2024's gaming year, The Axis Unseen was maybe one of the most interesting indie stoies. Nate Purkeypile clearly had a distinct vision and the experience to know how he wanted to apply it, but his early work in UE5 feels like a story other indie devs should appreciate and study. Even then, how many other games let you try to outmaneuver and hunt Bigfoot amid outcroppings of giant radical horned skulls and creature skeletons?\n\nThe Axis Unseen is available on Steam and Epic Games Store platforms.\n\n8. Mouthwashing\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of games that unnerve us here at Shacknews. Mouthwashing more than unnerved us, it wormed its way into our brain, made is feel uncomfortable, unpleasant, and disgusted at what people are capable of doing. It\u2019s also hands-down one of the indie games this year.\n\nMouthwashing is a psychological horror game set aboard a cargo vessel that\u2019s transporting goods between planets. The crew is small, consisting of just five people, and as you might assume, tensions fray. The game kicks off with the ship colliding with a celestial body after someone sabotaged the flight controls.\n\nFrom this point onward, the narrative plays out along two timelines: the lead up to the crash and following the crash. You\u2019ll be walking around the ship, helping solve the issues that crop up, from general maintenance to smoothing over everyone\u2019s emotional state. But things go sideways quickly.\n\nMouthwashing instils a sense of impending dread as the crew fights to survive not just dwindling supplies, but their withering emotional and mental stability. It\u2019s a harrowing game that left us staring at our screens, mouth agape, as the credits rolled. Want to feel gut-punched? Play Mouthwashing.\n\nMouthwashing is available on the Steam platform.\n\n7. Another Crab's Treasure\n\nSince Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring have solidified what the souls-like genre is, there have been no lack of studios derivating on it. But few have made their version of this genre stand out from the regular Soulsborne vibe like Another Crab\u2019s Treasure. Instead of being a forsaken ethereal being wandering through a fallen kingdom or the remains of a ferocious war, you\u2019re a hermit crab named Kril who just wants his shell back after a literal loan shark takes it from him. With that, you wander the floor of an ocean where all the local life has taken a shine to human garbage that has littered the seabed. And so, it\u2019s an undersea souls-like in which your \u201csoul\u201d resources are trash and your various weapons are \u201cshells\u201d Kril can equip that give him unique powers.\n\nThe environment itself in Another Crab\u2019s Treasure is equal parts funny, pretty, and upsetting. Every area you go to has some level of natural undersea beauty to it, but it\u2019s tainted with the cheap veneer of repurposed garbage from the human world that sea creatures have become enamored with. What most of them don\u2019t know is that prolonged contact with that trash makes them crazy and violent.\n\nThat means Kril has to fight through insane creatures, many of which are much larger than him. What\u2019s a hermit crab to do? Well, that\u2019s where the shells come in. At any time, Kril can jump into a nearby soda can, banana peel, yogurt cup, or any other prop to defend himself as he fights back with his trusty crab fork and fishing hook. The shell also matters because each of them has a different power you can use to even the odds and stay alive. For instance, the soda can lets you dodge backwards and release a spray of bubbles that home in on a target. Using the right shell in the right situation is key if you\u2019re going to survive. It\u2019s challenging to play, but Aggro Crab was also brave enough to allow you to soften the difficulty, up to and including the ridiculous option to give Kril a gun.\n\nUltimately, Aggro Crab blends a solid display of comedy and charm with a stark undertone. Its funny crab and crazy fish are cute as heck, but they can also be scary and upsetting in near equal capacity. The environments have a similar energy. Put that together with responsive action and platforming under the sea and you just might see the value of Another Crab\u2019s Treasure.\n\nAnother Crab's Treasure is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.\n\n6. The Plucky Squire\n\nThe Plucky Squire immediately climbed our most anticipated games of the year list when got our first glimpse at its reality-bending art style. With the combination of 2D and 3D art styles, developer All Possible Futures is able to have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nNot only is The Plucky Squire satisfying to look at, it's fun to play, too. It's levels and puzzles are packed with homages to the classics of the genre, with enough originality to keep gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nPlaying through The Plucky Squire is like reading a storybook rich with humor and fun characters. We hope this isn't the last we see of this neat little universe.\n\nThe Plucky Squire is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n5. UFO 50\n\nWhen we learned the developers of Spelunky and its sequel were going to be developing a new game, we expected it would be something cool. What we could have never guessed was that it would be 50 somethings that were each, in fact, cool. UFO 50 is a collection like nothing else. It\u2019s an homage to a vast array of classic video game titles and might be the most ridiculously efficient bang for your gaming buck, especially since many of its included games turned out to be full-length titles.\n\nRight from the get-go Mossmouth allows players access to every single one of the 50 games in UFO 50. The idea is that a mysterious company released all these games in obscurity. They all hearken back to the days of 80s arcades and home platforms, with some being very short and easy to beat while others are like full-length RPGs of the time that could take hours to complete.\n\nThey\u2019re a pretty awesome spread of titles too. Action, horror, sports, adventure, puzzle, and even narrative journeys are among those included here. Heck, there are even homages to metroidvanias, first-person dungeon crawlers, and narrative horror like NES\u2019s Uninvited, Deja Vu, and Shadowgate. Yet somehow, Mossmouth was able to also pack in its signature charm and humor in most cases, making this an altogether incredible collection.\n\nUFO 50 is a very easy game to recommend to anyone at any age because of the way it\u2019s set up. There\u2019s something for just about everyone here, and pretty much all of these games are worth trying at least once. We don\u2019t know what compelled Mossmouth to pack 50 different games into a single title, but we can\u2019t help but applaud the absolute madness and the quality that each title contains.\n\nUFO 50 is available on the Steam platform.\n\n4. Neva\n\nNeva delivered one of the year's most beautiful narratives with the tale of woman's bond with a wolf. It explores the relationship between a person and their animal companion, poignantly examining the highs and lows that entail.\n\nVisually, Neva is one of the year's most stunning games. Every location is picturesque, beautiful vistas juxtaposed against a decaying world.\n\nNeva is also a competent platformer, providing a decent challenge throughout its 5-6 hours of gameplay. That said, those in it for the narrative can opt to play in Story Mode.\n\nNeva is a reminder of the impact that video games can have, and that some of the best stories in games reside in the indie space.\n\nNeva is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n3. Pacific Drive\n\nPacific Drive saw an early release in 2024, but Ironwood Studios\u2019 sci-fi driving survival game got its hooks in and stayed with us well throughout the year. In all of 2024 gaming (and really beyond it for that matter), there was nothing quite like what Pacific Drive brought to the table. Moreover, its environments, music, and narrative were great enough to make sure that when this year\u2019s Shacknews Awards deliberations came around, it was still solidified in our minds as one of this year\u2019s most unique titles.\n\nIn Pacific Drive, you are a mysterious investigator that ventures into the mountainous forest region of the Pacific Northwest to a place known as the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Serious environmental experiments and oddities occurred in this place which led to the government building a barrier around it to keep what was inside, inside, and what was outside, outside. Obviously your intrusion means it didn\u2019t quite work, but it also isn\u2019t long before you discover a seemingly innocuous station wagon that acts as your getaway from a rough situation. And shortly after that, you discover folks that were both studying the Zone and got trapped by it. You also find a garage, which plays a big role in the rest of your journey.\n\nTo escape the Zone (theoretically) you\u2019ll need to venture deeper into it and collect energy from anomalous sites to power various experimental machinery. The Zone is a pretty fragile place, so every journey into a new area finds you traversing randomized stretches of dense forests and hills in the Station Wagon as you loot the supplies you need, build the tools that make things easier, and generally try to keep your station wagon maintained. After all, there\u2019s also freakish anomalies that can be a danger to you and the car such as autonomous piles of electrified scrap. Also, when you take the energy you need from a place in the Zone, that area\u2019s stability will collapse and it\u2019s a race to get out alive.\n\nGetting back to the garage and being able to recuperate with your pillaged resources was brief recompense, and it also feels therapeutic to repair and upgrade your car for the next adventure. You can even paint and put decals on it to make it truly your own. All of these things together made Pacific Drive a game unlike really anything else this year, and Ironwood Studios deserves to be celebrated for such an interesting journey, not to mention assembling such a perfect sci-fi roadtrip soundtrack with all of the good vibes of a personal mixtape.\n\nPacific Drive is available on PlayStation, and Steam platforms.\n\n2. Animal Well\n\nEveryone knew Animal Well was special the moment they laid eyes on it. The cute and unassuming pixel art style of a dark and lonely world was just dripping with mysteries to solve. Then it released and everyone realized the genius at work in Billy Basso\u2019s head.\n\nAnimal Well is a Metroidvania unlike anything that has come before it. There\u2019s no combat to be found, and as a tiny little critter, your only course of action against any threat is to run \u2013 or use the cleverly designed tools to your advantage.\n\nYou see, you\u2019re not going to get something as straightforward as unlocking double-jump or a grapple hook. You\u2019re going to get a Frisbee, a yo-yo, and other childhood toys. It\u2019s not even going to be clear how these things work and how you might use them to solve the game\u2019s myriad puzzles and navigate its dense, secret-packed world.\n\nBut when you do figure out how to use these items, you\u2019ll see the world differently. These little light bulb moments happen constantly throughout Animal Well as you engage in one of the best puzzle-platforming games this year.\n\nThough it hasn\u2019t secured our Indie Game of the Year 2024 award, it has come remarkably close and remains a favorite among the staff here at Shacknews. If you\u2019re a fan of unassuming indie games that have a tendency to blow your mind, you need to do yourself a favor and check out Animal Well.\n\nAnimal Well is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n1. Balatro\n\nThinking back over the past few decades at Shacknews, the staff is hard-pressed to think of any indie game that has garnered such universal acclaim or been as accomplished as Balatro. There have been memorable indie titles over the years. Games like Journey, Gone Home, and Hades come to mind as true standout efforts. Yet Balatro feels like it stands above them all. It certainly stands out over an incredibly stacked field of outstanding indie titles in 2024.\n\nFor solo developer LocalThunk to build on a relatively simple idea and captivate the entire gaming world has been nothing short of impressive. A poker roguelike sounds like a simple idea in theory, but the execution and the way it all came together has been special. Thousands of players across multiple platforms continue to try and chase high scores, just like in gaming days of old, all while utilizing well thought-out strategies and rolling with whatever luck befalls them. There are few sensations better in gaming right now than when a Balatro run comes together with the right combinations of rare Jokers, enhanced cards, and Boss Blinds that somehow manage not to upend the entire outing.\n\nThe Balatro formula is so easy to get into and drives its hooks in deep. It's part of why the Shacknews staff feared the day that it came to mobile devices, because it's the kind of game that's perfect to play on-the-go. It ranks up with historic handheld greats like Tetris and Dr. Mario in terms of easy accessibility and \"one more game\" loops that never seem to end.\n\nLocalThunk's efforts have been remarkable. It's amazing to see a single artist put the bulk of the work into such an expertly crafted game. It's the kind of phenomenon that gaming may never see for a long time. Shacknews was privileged to see the tale of Balatro play out over the course of 2024 and we're happy to name it the Shacknews Best Indie Game of 2024.\n\nBalatro is available on Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\nCheck out our Shacknews Indie Game of the Year 2024 - Balatro article to read more.\n\nWe salute everyone who released a game in this very difficult year for so many game developers. We couldn\u2019t do our jobs without these amazing creators. Thank you for another year of amazing indie games and congratulations to everyone who made our Shacknews Top 24 Indie Games of the Year 2024 list.\n\nBe sure to read over the rest of the Shacknews Awards in our Year of the Games: 2024 feature."

            "article_content": "An artist's impression of a hot exoplanet.\n\nAstronomers have unveiled the discovery of two Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting a star more than 40 light-years from our planet, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. A team of researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the pre-print server arXiv and shared by phys.org. The star, HD 101581, also catalogued as GJ 435, is a K5V-type orange dwarf star located about 42 light years away. The two confirmed exoplanets, designated HD 101581 b and HD 101581 c, were identified through meticulous observations using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its 63rd and 64th observation sectors. These planets exhibit radii comparable to Earth's, with HD 101581 b measuring approximately 0.956 times Earth's radius and HD 101581 c about 0.990 times. Their orbital periods are notably brief, with HD 101581 b completing a revolution around its host star every 4.47 days and HD 101581 c every 6.21 days.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Telescope.\n\nAdditionally, a third candidate planet, HD 101581 d, has been detected, though its existence awaits further confirmation. If validated, this planet would also be Earth-sized, with an orbital period of approximately 7.9 days. The discovery of these Earth-sized exoplanets is especially compelling due to their relative proximity to our solar system, which facilitates more detailed study. Nevertheless, their close orbits to HD 101581 suggest that they are subjected to intense stellar radiation, resulting in higher surface temperatures than Earth's. This likely renders them inhospitable to life as we know it. Despite the remote possibility that they could harbour life, the planets offer invaluable opportunities for scientific investigation.\n\nRecent images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Such research contributes to the broader objective of identifying Earth-like planets within habitable zones, where conditions may be conducive to life. This discovery arrives at a pivotal moment. The astronomical community anticipates a surge in exoplanet research in 2025, propelled by data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Launched in December 2021, the JWST has already demonstrated its capacity to observe distant cosmic phenomena with unprecedented clarity.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope captures Ring Nebula in \u2018unprecedented detail\u2019\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) model has just achieved human-level results on a test designed to measure \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d.\n\nOn December 20, OpenAI\u2019s o3 system scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, well above the previous AI best score of 55% and on par with the average human score. It also scored well on a very difficult mathematics test.\n\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is the stated goal of all the major AI research labs. At first glance, OpenAI appears to have at least made a significant step towards this goal.\n\nWhile scepticism remains, many AI researchers and developers feel something just changed. For many, the prospect of AGI now seems more real, urgent and closer than anticipated. Are they right?\n\nGeneralisation and intelligence\n\nTo understand what the o3 result means, you need to understand what the ARC-AGI test is all about. In technical terms, it\u2019s a test of an AI system\u2019s \u201csample efficiency\u201d in adapting to something new \u2013 how many examples of a novel situation the system needs to see to figure out how it works.\n\nAn AI system like ChatGPT (GPT-4) is not very sample efficient. It was \u201ctrained\u201d on millions of examples of human text, constructing probabilistic \u201crules\u201d about which combinations of words are most likely.\n\nThe result is pretty good at common tasks. It is bad at uncommon tasks, because it has less data (fewer samples) about those tasks.\n\nUntil AI systems can learn from small numbers of examples and adapt with more sample efficiency, they will only be used for very repetitive jobs and ones where the occasional failure is tolerable.\n\nThe ability to accurately solve previously unknown or novel problems from limited samples of data is known as the capacity to generalise. It is widely considered a necessary, even fundamental, element of intelligence.\n\nGrids and patterns\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark tests for sample efficient adaptation using little grid square problems like the one below. The AI needs to figure out the pattern that turns the grid on the left into the grid on the right.\n\nEach question gives three examples to learn from. The AI system then needs to figure out the rules that \u201cgeneralise\u201d from the three examples to the fourth.\n\nThese are a lot like the IQ tests sometimes you might remember from school.\n\nWeak rules and adaptation\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how OpenAI has done it, but the results suggest the o3 model is highly adaptable. From just a few examples, it finds rules that can be generalised.\n\nTo figure out a pattern, we shouldn\u2019t make any unnecessary assumptions, or be more specific than we really have to be. In theory, if you can identify the \u201cweakest\u201d rules that do what you want, then you have maximised your ability to adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat do we mean by the weakest rules? The technical definition is complicated, but weaker rules are usually ones that can be described in simpler statements.\n\nIn the example above, a plain English expression of the rule might be something like: \u201cAny shape with a protruding line will move to the end of that line and \u2018cover up\u2019 any other shapes it overlaps with.\u201d\n\nSearching chains of thought?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know how OpenAI achieved this result just yet, it seems unlikely they deliberately optimised the o3 system to find weak rules. However, to succeed at the ARC-AGI tasks it must be finding them.\n\nWe do know that OpenAI started with a general-purpose version of the o3 model (which differs from most other models, because it can spend more time \u201cthinking\u201d about difficult questions) and then trained it specifically for the ARC-AGI test.\n\nFrench AI researcher Francois Chollet, who designed the benchmark, believes o3 searches through different \u201cchains of thought\u201d describing steps to solve the task. It would then choose the \u201cbest\u201d according to some loosely defined rule, or \u201cheuristic\u201d.\n\nThis would be \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to how Google\u2019s AlphaGo system searched through different possible sequences of moves to beat the world Go champion.\n\nYou can think of these chains of thought like programs that fit the examples. Of course, if it is like the Go-playing AI, then it needs a heuristic, or loose rule, to decide which program is best.\n\nThere could be thousands of different seemingly equally valid programs generated. That heuristic could be \u201cchoose the weakest\u201d or \u201cchoose the simplest\u201d.\n\nHowever, if it is like AlphaGo then they simply had an AI create a heuristic. This was the process for AlphaGo. Google trained a model to rate different sequences of moves as better or worse than others.\n\nWhat we still don\u2019t know\n\nThe question then is, is this really closer to AGI? If that is how o3 works, then the underlying model might not be much better than previous models.\n\nThe concepts the model learns from language might not be any more suitable for generalisation than before. Instead, we may just be seeing a more generalisable \u201cchain of thought\u201d found through the extra steps of training a heuristic specialised to this test. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding.\n\nAlmost everything about o3 remains unknown. OpenAI has limited disclosure to a few media presentations and early testing to a handful of researchers, laboratories and AI safety institutions.\n\nTruly understanding the potential of o3 will require extensive work, including evaluations, an understanding of the distribution of its capacities, how often it fails and how often it succeeds.\n\nWhen o3 is finally released, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of whether it is approximately as adaptable as an average human.\n\nIf so, it could have a huge, revolutionary, economic impact, ushering in a new era of self-improving accelerated intelligence. We will require new benchmarks for AGI itself and serious consideration of how it ought to be governed.\n\nIf not, then this will still be an impressive result. However, everyday life will remain much the same.\n\nMichael Timothy Bennett, PhD Student, School of Computing, Australian National University and Elija Perrier, Research Fellow, Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology, Stanford University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "A representational picture showing the OpenAI logo displayed on a phone screen on May 20, 2024. \u2014 Reuters\n\nAnnouncing restructuring plans, OpenAI said on Friday it would establish a public benefit company to make it simpler to \"raise more capital than it had imagined,\" and lift the restrictions placed on the firm by its present nonprofit parent.\n\nThe recognition and thorough justification for its high-profile restructuring confirmed a September Reuters story that provoked discussion among tech titans like Elon Musk and corporate watchdogs.\n\nAt issue were the implications such a move might have on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the ChatGPT maker's existing for-profit arm would become a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC) \u2014 a structure designed to consider the interests of society in addition to shareholder value.\n\nOpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment, as the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up.\n\nIts latest $6.6 billion funding round at a valuation of $157 billion was contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker could upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors within two years, Reuters reported in October.\n\nThe nonprofit, meanwhile, will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC in the form of shares as determined by independent financial advisers, OpenAI said in a blog post, adding that it would be one of the \"best resourced nonprofits in history.\"\n\nOpenAI started in 2015 as a research-focused nonprofit but created a for-profit unit four years later to secure funding for the high costs of AI development. Its unusual structure gave control of the for-profit unit to the nonprofit and was in focus last year when Sam Altman was fired as CEO only to return days later after employees rebelled.\n\n'Critical step'\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness,\" the Microsoft-backed startup said on Friday.\n\n\"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nIts plans to create a PBC would align the startup with rivals such as Anthropic and the Musk-owned xAI, which use a similar structure and recently raised billions in funding.\n\nAnthropic garnered another $4 billion investment from existing investor Amazon.com last month, while xAI raised around $6 billion in equity financing earlier in December.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business,'\" DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.\n\n\"This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public.\"\n\nThe startup could, however, face some hurdles in the plan.\n\nMusk, an OpenAI co-founder who later left and is now one of the startup's most vocal critics, is trying to stop the plan and in August sued OpenAI and Altman. Musk alleges that OpenAI violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI.\n\nOpenAI earlier this month asked a federal judge to reject Musk's request and published a trove of messages with Musk to argue that he initially backed for-profit status for OpenAI before walking away from the company after failing to gain a majority equity stake and full control.\n\nMeta Platforms is also urging California's attorney general to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nBecoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee in and of itself that a company will put its stated mission above profit, as that status legally requires only that the company's board \"balance\" its mission and profit-making concerns, said Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School.\n\n\"The only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public,\" she said. \"It doesn't actually have any real enforcement power behind it,\" she said.\n\nIn practice, it is the shareholders who own a controlling stake in the company who dictate how closely a public benefit company sticks to its mission, Lipton said."

            "article_content": "For anyone living under a social media rock, #vanlife has become one of the biggest viral trends of the last few years.\n\nTaking off during the pandemic, on TikTok the hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, with a further 15 million posts on Instagram.\n\nThe nomadic way of life is popular with (mainly) young people, and preceded the 'underconsumption core' lifestyle.\n\nGolden sunsets, expansive beaches, fairy lights and romantic filters; living out of a van is as Instagram aesthetic as it gets (on the surface).\n\nBut what about living out of an electric car? Could that be the most eco and luxury van life possible? Or is the reality just a photo opportunity but a holiday to avoid?\n\nThis is Money\u2019s Freda Lewis-Stempel took a new Tesla Model Y with its own specially designed 'Air Mattress' and \u2018Camp Mode\u2019 to one of the remotest islands in the UK to find out....\n\nCan you really sleep in a Tesla? This is Money's Motoring Reporter Freda Lewis-Stempel puts the electric car version of the #vanlife trend to a very remote test....\n\nHow the Model Y is designed for 'van life' glamping?\n\nIt makes sense to first explain how Tesla has taken the American \u2018van life\u2019 idea and added special features to the Model Y SUV to make it double up as a home on wheels.\n\nTesla Air Mattress: This \u00a3200 blow-up mattress has been designed to fit the rear of the car perfectly when the back seats are folded down. Penned on tracing paper, it has the cutouts in precisely the correct places in order for it to sit flush to the floor around wheel arches and arm rests.\n\nIt pumps up almost instantly when connected to the car's 12V outlet in the boot.\n\nJust roll the air mattress out, plug the air pump into the 12V, slot the air pump nozzle into the air mattress intake, turn the air pump on and watch it inflate.\n\nAt this point you can decide to go full glamping \u2018boujee\u2019 and bring a sheet, pillows and duvet like we did, or you can go more pop-up tent style and just use a sleeping bag and inflatable pillow.\n\nTesla has a specially shaped Air Mattress for its Model Y SUV that inflates to turn the car into a bed for the night\n\nTesla's Camp Mode is another sleeping-friendly feature that keeps the cabin at the perfect temperature overnight to make sure you don't get too hot or cold\n\nCamp Mode: Sort of genius from Tesla, Camp Mode maintains the optimum temperature and airflow within the cabin while you sleep so you don\u2019t wake up freezing cold or boiling hot in the middle of the night.\n\nIt also maintains the lighting setup you want or even music or a podcast if that helps you sleep.\n\nThere's even a Camp Profile which remembers your preferences and sets them automatically when you want to crash for the night.\n\nTo enter Camp Mode, just tap the temperature menu icon on the bottom of the screen and select Camp (or use the Tesla app).\n\nSentry Mode, auto lock and the Model Y\u2019s alarm system are all disabled with Camp Mode so the alarm doesn\u2019t go off every time you exist - just remember to lock the car yourself while you sleep!\n\nWhy Scotland? Scotland is popular for wild camping because of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which gives everyone the right to access Scotland's outdoor spaces. You can park and camp by the side of the road as long as you aren't blocking access or parked dangerously. The Outdoor Access Code does stipulate you should camp away from roads, but campervans frequently park in larger lay-bys. As some of the most remote and dramatic countryside in the UK, especially on the islands, Scotland is also a brilliant place to put EV charging and range anxiety to the test too.\n\nDay 1/night 1: Regrettable decision? It can only get better...\n\nMy plucky school friend and I left London at around 5.30pm to drive up to the Peak District.\n\nIt was all going swimmingly, cruising up the M6 in the warm, extremely comfortable and smooth Model Y.\n\nThough I tend to find Teslas a bit clinical (or 'spaceship-y', as my friend said) for long journeys, their performance is undeniably strong.\n\nThe space, comfort, and how Teslas hold their range makes driving for hours minimum effort, and the Y was no different.\n\nDeciding to charge at the Superchargers near Stoke-on-Trent - because we didn't know how much range Camp Mode would use overnight - we snuck in the back door of a restaurant nearby to use the loo to brush our teeth and get ready for 'bed\u2019.\n\nThere were a few funny looks as we set the air mattress up for the night at the Superchargers (so we didn\u2019t have to figure it out for the first time in the middle of nowhere in the pitch-black Peaks), but it was very easy to set up.\n\nWhile the Y finished charging, we used the Theatre function - which has Netflix, YouTube, Hulu etc - to watch the different Christmas adverts on the touchscreen; Waitrose\u2019s \u2018who dunnit\u2019 was of course the clear winner.\n\nThanks to Tesla's Theatre suite we could watch all the Christmas adverts on YouTube while the car charged\n\nBrushing your teeth and washing your face in a restaurant loo near a Tesla Supercharger is the glamorous reality of Tesla living\n\nThen we drove off in search of our sleeping spot in the wild for the night.\n\nWe\u2019d pre-selected a place using the Park4night app, but driving up to a lay-by under a remote bridge and encountering just one guy and his camper van we got the heebie-jeebies and decided to find an alternative.\n\nThe only other option nearby was a lay-by/field gate entrance, and (after accidentally driving through someone\u2019s farmyard) we decided this was the best of two rather unappealing options, as it was already almost midnight.\n\nOff to bed (a bed that was as steep as Everest because the parking spot was on a sharp incline) I awoke just over four hours later at 4.55am.\n\nMy friend had seemingly disappeared. In a bleary state, I thought she'd been abducted, but thankfully she\u2019d just moved to the front seat to try and sleep.\n\nTurning the headlights on, we had a near heart attack (my second in 10 minutes) when they picked up a Land Rover Discovery that had silently turned up sometime between 12.40 and 4.55am.\n\nConvincing ourselves we weren\u2019t going to end up as front page horror story news, we tried to get back to sleep.\n\nIt was at this point we learnt two valuable EV glamping lessons: never park on an incline and an overinflated Air Mattress is, as I ruefully summarised, like sleeping on a slab of rock.\n\nWaking up in Leek in Staffordshire wasn't the most picturesque first wake up in the Tesla I'd envisioned as the beautiful countryside was hidden in fog and we'd had 4 hours of sleep each\n\nI failed to fall back to sleep, but my friend did, so I watched a very cold and wet dawn creep in through the windows and panoramic sunroof. It was about as picturesque as you can imagine watching a dawn rise while sleeping in the Model Y.\n\nI also watched two other cars come and go \u2013 one of which was a hunter\u2019s van containing three Hound of the Baskervilles-sized hunting dogs.\n\nIn the end, my friend and I ended up getting four hours sleep each. It wasn't a great way to kick-off but thanks to the Camp Mode we were at least nice and warm. And, as only a year before we'd spent a night in the Peaks in -5 degrees on top of a Jeep Wrangler in a Tentbox, we knew how absolutely brutal car 'glamping' really can be.\n\nGoing for a brisk wake-up walk around 8am, we packed down the Air Mattress and set off for our pre-Scotland charging and feed stop at Tebay.\n\nDay 2/night 2: How much difference a day can make\n\nThe Tebay pit stop seriously perked us both up.\n\nWhile the car had a full charge on the Superchargers - we were charging to 100 per cent, which isn't as good for the battery as charging to 80 per cent but for wilderness camping it is sensible.\n\nI managed a nap followed by a shower (you swap your car key for the shower key at Tebay and it\u2019s free to use), and we both scoffed full English breakfasts.\n\nThen it was back into the car for another three hours of driving up to Edinburgh for a afternoon 'city break'.\n\nThe road's were opening up and the scenery became road trip goals - in my opinion the best motorway driving in the UK is the Cumbria-Borders stretch - and everything was looking up.\n\nEdinburgh was a chance to get some steps and movement in, and a bit of big city excitement before the total and utter isolation that the next sleeping spot would bring.\n\nWe'd pre-planned to sleep in a very remote valley between Edinburgh and the Ardrossan ferry terminal where we had a 9am ferry to catch the next morning.\n\nI wanted to try Edinburgh public charging because it has a bad reputation, and although I did manage to find a charger, for a capital city Edinburgh charging has some way to go\n\nWe drove for about three hours to walk around Edinburgh and find some hot food before our next lay-by camp\n\nI also wanted to test Edinburgh EV charging infrastructure because it has a bad reputation for being underprovided.\n\nIn reality this is unfortunately true - considering it\u2019s the capital of Scotland the charging options are pretty slim.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fussy and didn\u2019t mind what speed we charged, but that didn't really help.\n\nThere aren't many chargers and almost all of them were in use.\n\nUnlike London, Edinburgh doesn't have lots of lamp post chargers, so all the on-street chargers are taken by residents.\n\nWe did, however, find one fast charger near George Street, so we walked around Edinburgh and had some hot food while the Model Y slow charged.\n\nAt around 6pm we drove off to find our next Park4night place.\n\nThe second night camping location was the stuff of Instagram posts - although murky weather the remote Scottish hills were beautiful and it felt safe which led to a great nights' sleep\n\nThe Model Y has massive windows and a huge panoramic roof so you get 360 views when you wake up\n\nThis time we wanted the spot to be as isolated as possible, and we found it; a single-track road about 30 minutes from the coast without a soul in sight. Not a star, not an animal \u2013 nothing. And it felt so much safer.\n\nI should explain that my school friend and I both grew up in very remote parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire so having no-one around feels safer for us than having people nearby, but over people might entirely disagree with this logic.\n\nFeeling far more secure than night one, it allowed us to relax into our bedtime camping 'routine' (i.e. cleaning our teeth with water from a bottle).\n\nWe got the bed blowing-up level right this time, which meant the Air Mattress went from being a slab of rock to incredibly comfortable.\n\nWhile we could use the Tesla Model Y's Theatre mode again, part of the relaxation of camping is winding down reading a book\n\nThen we got the Camp Mode temperature perfect, read our books and drifted off to sleep in our very cosy hotel on wheels. We slept like logs.\n\nI woke about 6am to a glorious stormy Scottish dawn sky, and an empty valley of mountains.\n\nIt was everything I\u2019d thought Tesla living would be. And the night before moved into funny memories.\n\nDay three/night three: Tesla living on the Isle of Arran - as good as glamping gets\n\nScotland has 'right-to-access' laws so it's much easier to camp in a car in Scotland than England. A place as remote as the Isle of Arran is a real test for glamping in an EV\n\nStarting off at 7.20am to drive 20 minutes for an ultra-rapid top-up charge before we boarded the Ardrossan car ferry, we pulled up at the InstaVolt chargers outside a McDonalds at Stevenston.\n\nWho doesn't love a retail park and a Maccies hash brown before 8am?\n\nThe loos provided a chance to brush our teeth and clean our faces while the car went from around 80 to 100 per cent charge - after all, glamping is all about glamour.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range AWD has a range of 373 miles which gives you around 330/340 real world range.\n\nWe didn't actually need to be at 100 per cent before going across to the Isle of Arran - which is only 56 miles in circumference - but, while there are a few chargers in the 'capital' of Arran (Brodrick), ZapMap said they only take RFID cards so we played it very over safe.\n\nWe put the car on some Instavolt ultra-rapid chargers near the ferry port before we boarded\n\nWhile living out of a Tesla you have to find food and washing facilities wherever you can, and sometimes it's McDonalds or nothing (even at 8am)\n\nSentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app\n\nBoarding the Ardrossan ferry, we were in excellent EV company as the four cars nearest us were all EVs - clearly range anxiety isn't a thing in the Scottish Isles.\n\nDuring the 55 minute crossing, Sentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app in general.\n\nI felt very smug knowing that the none of the many car alarms going off belonged to the Model Y because the Tesla app hadn't alerted me to any issues.\n\nWe also had far too much fun watching ourselves on the Sentry Mode cameras disembarking the ferry as we sat waiting for the cars in front to drive off.\n\nFor the rest of the day we drove around Arran, using the freedom of the car and no time restraints to let nature lead us. We went for a walk, swam in the very cold sea, and watched the wildlife - Arran is famous for its seals.\n\nThe Isle of Arran only has four public chargers and you can only get a ferry to the mainland: There are three in Brodrick and one near Blackwaterfoot so you can really test range anxiety\n\nDriving around the Isle of Arran with no check-in times to abide by we could enjoy the scenery and outdoor pursuits to our own schedule\n\nTesla's cabin pre-conditioning feature on the app was also a godsend for when we wanted to come back to a warm car and heated seats and steering wheel after a freezing dip.\n\nWhile our day activities were quite messy, the Tesla and its vegan seats were very easy to keep clean.\n\nAs a living in a car goes it was remarkably easy to stay tidy and the vast storage throughout meant we were never short of space for our stuff.\n\nThe Model Y has 854 litres of boot space as well as a 117-litre frunk: more than enough space for all our 'glamping' stuff and the front trunk became a designated space for wet swimming costumes, towels and muddy boats.\n\nThe hooks above the passenger doors were also useful to hang our clothes to dry.\n\nThe Tesla has lots of space, and it was very easy to keep clean. Even if we left the bed in place, we still had plenty of space for our bags and the frunk meant we could separate wet clothes\n\nAlthough the Model Y has bi-directional charging (where you can power appliances from the car), we didn't take a kettle or camping chairs mainly because, without an awning or a settled camping spot, sitting outside in the bracing Scottish winter wind didn't seem very appealing.\n\nWhile the car means you can go anywhere, anytime, playing everything by ear also has its downfalls: We drove to get dinner at 6pm on the far side of the island only to be told the restaurant was fully-booked.\n\nAlthough we did eventually manage to have a very early dinner at a hotel near Brodrick, the Tesla glamping lesson of the day here would be to at least pre-book your meal reservations, especially if it's out of season.\n\nParked up against the sea, Tesla camping on the Isle of Arran is truly an amazing experience\n\nDuring the afternoon, we'd driven from the north west of Arran across to the north east and had passed many a lovely, big, isolated lay-by, noting a few that we'd be happy to park for the night in any of them (frankly we were spoilt for choice on Arran).\n\nAmusingly (or mildly concerningly depending how you look at it), I'd turned to my friend as I eyed up one particular lay-by (the one we ended up choosing) and said; 'I'll never look at a lay-by the same way again'. She said she'd been thinking the exact same thing.\n\nIn the space of a few nights, Tesla camping had changed us - we'd become discerning connoisseurs of lay-bys. I will forever look at scenic lay-by and think 'that looks like a very nice place to spend the night in an EV'.\n\nIn the end, we chose one glorious lay-by near the sea, and with our glamping night routine down to a T, we settled in for our last night.\n\nWe watched Netflix's Nobody Wants This from our Air Mattress bed, thoroughly enjoying the Model Y mobile cinema offered to modern day electric car nomads against a picturesque lay-by backdrop in the Scottish hills.\n\nWaiting to board the ferry back to mainland UK: Is Tesla glamping for the fainthearted? No. But is it a fantastic adventure? Yes.\n\nIt felt sad to say goodbye to our house on wheels on the drive home as we'd become quite attached\n\nThe next morning, after we had one last cold sea swim before boarding the ferry to begin our drive back to London, we both agreed we'd happily spend another three nights sleeping in the Tesla.\n\nLiving out of one? No. Glamping out of one again? Without a doubt.\n\nJust make sure your friends are up for an adventure and aren't at all precious..."

            "article_content": "The meme coin market has been buzzing, hasn\u2019t it? Every few months, a new quirky token emerges, setting the internet on fire and sending crypto enthusiasts into a frenzy. With the overall crypto market adapting to economic turbulence, meme coins have shown surprising resilience and creativity. Their blend of community spirit and innovative utility is a massive draw. If you thought 2023 was meme coin madness, wait till you see what 2024 has in store. Among this vibrant chaos, one coin that\u2019s stealing the show is BTFD Coin (BTFD). Let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019re chasing returns, you might want to keep reading.\n\nBTFD Coin isn\u2019t just riding the meme coin wave \u2013 it\u2019s redefining it. With a thriving presale already crossing $4.44 million and groundbreaking features like its Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, referral programme, and staking with a juicy 90% APY, it\u2019s attracting investors like flies to a barbecue. If you\u2019re looking for the best meme coins for massive income, you\u2019ll want to stick around as we explore this coin and its competitors.\n\n1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin to Watch\n\nWhat sets BTFD Coin apart? A whole lot, actually. From its quirky name (a cheeky nod to the phrase \u201cbuy the dip\u201d) to its feature-packed ecosystem, this token is the new superstar in town. Its presale launched at an eyebrow-raising $0.000004 per coin and has now reached Stage 12, priced at $0.000064. Analysts are predicting fireworks, with a listing price of $0.0006 post-presale. BTFD\u2019s referral programme and 90% staking APY are also luring savvy investors.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Play 2 Earn game is a major talking point. Although it\u2019s still in beta (launched in Stage 10), the full version promises rewards that could rival established P2E platforms. For those who love to hustle, BTFD\u2019s referral programme is pure gold. With every new investor brought on board, you earn additional rewards. And did we mention the Bulls Squad? This elite community is rallying hard to push the token\u2019s value to new heights.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because it\u2019s a juggernaut in the making. A presale performance surpassing $4.6 million, game-changing utility, and a vibrant community make BTFD Coin a no-brainer for those hunting the best meme coins for massive income.\n\nHead to the presale page and be part of the meme coin revolution. Unlock 50% more coins by using the BIG50 bonus code when you buy in.\n\n2. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin\n\nDogecoin hardly needs an introduction, does it? As the pioneer of the meme coin world, it\u2019s been a darling of the internet and a plaything for whales. DOGE owes much of its stardom to endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk, whose tweets alone can send it soaring. Its simplicity and absurdity\u2014a Shiba Inu dog on a coin\u2014made it a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nUnlike many meme coins, Dogecoin has stayed relevant by being surprisingly practical. It\u2019s fast, has low transaction fees, and boasts one of the largest communities in the crypto world. The coin\u2019s use in tipping and small-scale payments has helped it secure a spot in everyday crypto usage. Plus, with ongoing discussions about integrating DOGE into platforms like X (formerly Twitter), it\u2019s clear this meme coin isn\u2019t just a fad.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, it\u2019s a legend. Dogecoin remains a cornerstone of the meme coin ecosystem and is one of the best meme coins for massive income for investors who value stability alongside fun.\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Dogecoin Killer\n\nShiba Inu entered the crypto stage as the self-proclaimed \u201cDogecoin Killer.\u201d While that may have sounded ambitious at the time, SHIB\u2019s rise was nothing short of spectacular. This Ethereum-based token launched with a decentralised vibe, and its ShibaSwap platform added a level of utility most meme coins can only dream about.\n\n2024 has been a transformative year for SHIB. Its developers are working on Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain solution to lower transaction costs and increase speed. Combine this with the ShibaSwap ecosystem and its NFT ventures, and you\u2019ve got a meme coin with serious utility backing its meme appeal. Its massive, devoted community (nicknamed the SHIB Army) and innovative features make it a top contender in the meme coin race.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Shiba Inu has moved beyond being a meme coin. Its utility and ambitious plans for the future cement its position as one of the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n4. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Dark Horse\n\nAh, Pepe Coin. What started as an internet joke became a decentralised sensation in the meme coin market. Inspired by the infamous frog meme, PEPE has a devoted, albeit niche, following. The coin thrives on its community\u2019s creativity and humour, often launching viral campaigns that boost its visibility and trading volume.\n\nIn 2024, PEPE has proven it\u2019s not just a flash in the pan. The token\u2019s development team has hinted at potential collaborations and upcoming utilities that could elevate its status. For now, its charm lies in its meme culture and its ability to surprise investors with sudden price surges.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Pepe Coin\u2019s unpredictable nature, strong community, and potential for explosive gains make it a wildcard in the hunt for the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n5. Bonk (BONK): Solana\u2019s Meme Marvel\n\nBonk made waves as the first major meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its launch was all about giving back to the community. In fact, 50% of its initial supply was airdropped to Solana users, making it an instant hit. Unlike most meme coins, BONK\u2019s appeal lies in its unique association with Solana\u2019s fast, low-cost transactions.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about BONK is its community-driven approach. The coin has spurred a wave of activity on Solana, from NFT projects to decentralised applications. It\u2019s a meme coin that\u2019s breathing new life into its blockchain, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Bonk\u2019s alignment with Solana\u2019s robust infrastructure and its strong community engagement make it a standout contender among the best meme coins for massive income.\n\nThe Economic Crash of 1973: Lessons for Today\u2019s Investors\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to 1973, a year marked by a global economic crash that sent shockwaves through markets. Those who seized the chaos as an opportunity to buy undervalued assets reaped massive rewards in the years that followed. The lesson? Economic downturns are goldmines for the bold.\n\nFast forward to today, and the crypto market\u2019s bearish trends mirror those turbulent times. Meme coins, particularly BTFD Coin, offer a unique chance to capitalise on these dips. With its thriving presale and robust ecosystem, BTFD isn\u2019t just a meme; it\u2019s a strategy for navigating these chaotic times.\n\nHow to Join the BTFD Coin Presale\n\nGetting your hands on BTFD Coin is a cinch. Just go to the presale page. Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet works great), enter the bonus code BIG50, and hit \u201cApply.\u201d Enter the amount you want to invest,use the BIG50 bonus code to lock in 50% extra coins during your purchase. and confirm the transaction. Boom, you\u2019re in.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on our research and market trends, meme coins are redefining investment opportunities for the modern era. Whether you\u2019re looking at the innovation of BTFD Coin, the legacy of Dogecoin, or the emerging potential of Bonk, there\u2019s something for every risk appetite.

The corporation deployed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities in 2024 to stop expected $129 million in losses brought on by dishonest behavior.\n\nBinance is significantly trying to outsmart criminals and improve user security by blacklisting 47,000 suspicious wallet addresses and delivering over 15,000 scam alerts every day.\n\nBINANCE BLOCKS $129M IN SCAMS WITH NEXT-LEVEL AI Binance flexed hard in 2024, using AI and machine learning to shut down $129M in scams. They blacklisted 47K sketchy addresses, recovered $9M monthly, and sent 15K daily scam alerts to keep users safe. With 30K+ warning calls\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rcXZAVHsbs \u2014 Mario Nawfal\u2019s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) December 29, 2024\n\nBinance: Proactive Measures Elevating Crypto Security\n\nFurthermore, Binance uses preventive actions outside blacklists and alerts. The company set up a complex mechanism offering a 24-hour window for users to report possible fraud, capable of freezing transactions judged suspicious. This creative ability has provided users a chance to recover their money before permanent damage results.\n\nThrough over 30,000 warning calls, Binance has also personally contacted its users in an effort to educate and guard them from new risks. These initiatives have resulted in the monthly recovery of $9.1 million, guaranteeing that scam victims get quick help and compensation.\n\nBinance employs over 50 machine-learning models, continuously enhancing them with 14 significant upgrades throughout the year. These models, which show Binance\u2019s flexibility in a fast-changing digital terrain, have been crucial in spotting and reducing always-shifting dishonest strategies.\n\nBy keeping ahead of scams, Binance is establishing new benchmarks for crypto security and presenting itself as a pioneer in user protection in the volatile crypto market.\n\nStill, Binance\u2019s regulatory difficulties always center attention. CNF has brought attention to the lawsuit Binance Australia was sued for by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\nThe lawsuit charges the business with misclassifying more than 500 retail customers, therefore depriving them of suitable consumer protection for derivatives. Binance paid affected customers $8.29 million in response. Still, ASIC keeps looking for further fines to guarantee more compliance and support measures for investors."

And then, unfortunately, these explosions and sounds never stopped. And basically, until now, it's over 600 days since the war started in Sudan. We stayed in our house for three weeks, and then we started getting out of running out of food and water and electricity. And then moving out was a must,\u201d Elsaim says.\n\nAccording to Elsaim, those hit the hardest by climate change were the most vulnerable, including the millions displaced by the fighting.\n\n\u201cThe war in Sudan caused more than 12 million refugees and IDPs,\u201d Elsaim notes.\n\n\u201cThe biggest number of IDPs were concentrated in these states where it was flooded. The total area that was flooded is bigger than Germany in its size and definitely had a lot of the camps inside of it. Currently, Sudan is living the biggest humanitarian crisis ever,'' she adds.\n\nShe's calling for more humanitarian aid, and for aid to be adapted to withstand the effects of extreme weather.\n\n\u201cWe must consider climate change when we are planning for humanitarian interventions. Making climate sensitive humanitarian is not a privilege right now. It's a key and it's a must, basically. Otherwise, all of our humanitarian efforts will just flood with the water,'' Elsaim insists.\n\nWith regular droughts and significant variations in rainfall, Sudan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the UN.\n\nThe conflict between the Sudanese Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out in April 2023; since then, at least 20,000 have been killed."

Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "Over two years since the introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2013 a quick and easy way to ask an AI model almost anything \u2013 artificial intelligence has continued to dominate talks, headlines and economic research and will likely continue to do so throughout the following year.\n\nFrom algorithms powering search engines to sophisticated tools diagnosing medical conditions, artificial intelligence is reshaping industries, redefining work and challenging our understanding of intelligence itself.\n\nAI is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it is rapidly becoming an integral part of life. But with breakneck innovation, the near future likely holds even more transformative change shaped by the key trends driving this revolution.\n\nWhile generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have mainly shaped these trends until now, what appears to be the dawn of a new era is so-called agentic AI.\n\nDescribed basically as \"a combination of different AI techniques, models, and approaches,\" it is seen as \"a new breed of autonomous agents that can analyze data, set goals and take action to achieve them, all with minimal human supervision.\"\n\nAccording to many companies, experts and recent reports, this trend looks to be the dominant trend that could shape the artificial intelligence sector next year.\n\nBut what more to expect? Let's break it down:\n\nOpenAI transition\n\nTalking about AI means talking about the company, which some call \"consequential\" in the field \u2013 and yes, that's OpenAI.\n\nSam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, has just recently said surprise advancements could be in store next year.\n\n\"I expect that in 2025 we will have systems that people look at, even people who are skeptical of current progress, and say, 'Wow, I did not expect that,'\" Altman said, speaking at the New York Times' DealBook Summit earlier this month.\n\nReflecting on the time when ChatGPT was launched, Altman also said, \"My guess is we will hit AGI (artificial general intelligence) sooner than most people in the world think, and it will matter much less.\"\n\nHis remarks came ahead of the announcement of the startup's new o3 model and details on the transition from being a non-profit entity, as it has been classified so far.\n\nUnder the plan announced on Friday, OpenAI said it looks to revamp its structure, saying it would create a public benefit corporation to make it easier to \"raise more capital than we'd imagined\" and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current non-profit parent.\n\nAI future, multimodality\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody knows the truth. I\u2019m sure there will be another explosion at some point where there\u2019s a fundamental change in the architecture of the models. Don\u2019t know when and don\u2019t know where,\" Pascale Fung, director of the Center for AI Research (CAiRE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told Anadolu Agency (AA) when asked about the future of AI.\n\nAI systems capable of processing multiple data types simultaneously, such as text, images, audio and video, have become a driving force in the industry toward what has been called multimodality.\n\nFung, also a senior director of AI research at Meta-FAIR, a research initiative by Facebook's parent company Meta, highlighted the significance of such a shift.\n\n\"That\u2019s not just text. It\u2019s not just a chatbot, but it can also see what you see and hear what you hear.\"\n\nMultimodal systems, like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, already integrate vision and auditory perception with text-based capabilities.\n\nThese technologies analyze visual or auditory data in real-time, enabling applications like assisting visually impaired individuals by describing their surroundings or reading text aloud.\n\nAI agents\n\nOne step forward from chatbots, AI agents are redefining assistance by managing complex, multistep tasks.\n\nUnlike chatbots that answer questions, AI agents can perform complex tasks, like booking a family vacation or managing executive schedules, Fung explained. These agents function as \"smart humans,\" using tools to solve problems and create value.\n\nPascale Fung, senior director of AI Research at Meta and a chair professor of Electronic & Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST) delivers a speech during a panel on artificial intelligence at TRT World Forum, Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye, Nov. 30, 2024. (AA Photo)\n\nIn a recent report, Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry at Microsoft Copilot, described agents as \"the apps of the AI era.\"\n\n\"Agents will begin to transform every business process, revolutionizing the way we work and manage our organizations,\" he added.\n\nThe possibilities are vast. As virtual travel planners, AI agents could optimize itineraries. As executive assistants, they can schedule meetings and manage workflows with nuanced judgment, able to juggle a multitude of factors playing into the decisions these would involve.\n\nEchoing these views and providing details on the concept of AI agents, Kristina Tikhonova, Microsoft General Manager for Southeast Europe, told earlier in an interview with Daily Sabah that \"AI agents represent a new era where AI systems work together seamlessly, with one AI agent able to request actions from others.\"\n\nSome large companies have already launched their agent products in this direction. Salesforce, for example, created Agentforce, and Microsoft has shared the concept of creating autonomous agents with Copilot Studio.\n\nNew frontiers\n\nYet, despite significant advancements, current AI systems still fall short of matching human intelligence in most areas \u2013 something that could only be achieved by what has been called artificial general intelligence or AGI.\n\nAt the same time, a dilemma also prevails over the question of the actual benchmark for achieving this.\n\nOften referred to as the \"holy grail\" of AI, developing an AGI system would represent a significant leap toward artificial superintelligence (ASI), systems capable of surpassing human cognitive abilities across multiple domains.\n\nWhile AGI is defined by its ability to achieve human-level intellectual performance, ASI goes further, outperforming humans in reasoning, problem-solving and creative tasks.\n\nOpenAI's Altman has predicted that superintelligence could emerge within a \"few thousand days,\" marking a profound paradigm shift.\n\nIn the near term, AI systems are expected by 2025 to solve increasingly complex problems with advanced reasoning skills.\n\nAdvanced AI models, such as OpenAI o1, already exhibit capabilities that mimic human reasoning, enabling tasks such as contract analysis, scientific discoveries and multistep project execution. Such capabilities are expected to develop in the coming years.\n\nComputational power, spending\n\nMoreover, behind AI\u2019s rapid advancements lies unprecedented progress in computational power.\n\nGoogle recently revealed its landmark quantum chip, Willow, able to complete a benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take today\u2019s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, the company claimed.\n\nThis breakthrough highlights the potential to overcome current computational limits, enabling advanced AI models to tackle previously insurmountable challenges.\n\nGoogle Quantum AI's Hartmut Neven (L) and Anthony Megrant (R) examine a cryostat refrigerator for cooling quantum computing chips at Google's Quantum AI lab in Santa Barbara, California, U.S., Nov. 25, 2024. (Reuters Photo)\n\nHowever, the energy demands of such systems raise environmental concerns. Industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are expected to prioritize sustainable, energy-efficient technologies to mitigate these impacts.\n\nSome of these tech giants, alongside Amazon and Meta, have already moved toward nuclear energy as data centers powering artificial intelligence and cloud computing are pushing energy demand and production to new limits.\n\nOn the other hand, all this has resulted in unprecedented AI-related spending, which made artificial intelligence and crypto a top story of the tech market in 2024.\n\n\"Some of the biggest winners in this year\u2019s stock market rally that\u2019s seen the Nasdaq jump 33% and other U.S. indexes notch double-digit gains have direct ties to the rapid advancements in AI. Chipmaker Nvidia is among them, but it\u2019s not alone,\" a report by CNBC said recently.\n\nA slowdown?\n\nHowever, after two years of fierce upward momentum, some analysts continue to wonder whether an AI slowdown is imminent.\n\nA recent report by The New York Times, titled \"Is the Tech Industry Already on the Cusp of an A.I. Slowdown?\" said, \"Interviews with 20 executives and researchers showed a widespread belief that the tech industry is running into a problem that too many were unthinkable just a few years ago. They have used up most of the digital text available on the internet.\"\n\nIt also cited Demis Hassabis, one of the most influential AI experts in the world and this year's recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AI research contributions to protein structure prediction, to have a warning for the rest of the tech industry.\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 co-laureate British AI researcher Demis Hassabis gestures as he gives his Nobel Prize lecture in Aula Magna, Stockholm University, Sweden, Dec. 8, 2024. (AFP Photo)\n\n\"Don\u2019t expect chatbots to continue to improve as quickly as they have over the last few years,\" he said.\n\nWith an apparent peak in data and rapid proliferation, it remains to be seen how major companies would move forward to fine-tune models, work on reasoning and their next key strategies.\n\nBroader applications, impact\n\nOften described as a sort of new \"industrial revolution,\" AI also brings a long list of impacts and transformations within. From aspects involving jobs to a possible tremendous impact on fields such as health care, AI is on track to be more integrated and involved in everyday lives as time passes.\n\nFung, for example, underlined AI\u2019s potential in agriculture: to revolutionize productivity, disease detection and water regulation.\n\n\"It can help eradicate hunger by ensuring more equitable food production and distribution,\" Fung explained. Improvements in logistics could also reduce food waste, addressing global challenges of hunger and inefficiency, she said.\n\nThe integration of AI into daily life has also sparked concerns about job displacement.\n\n\"Every major technological achievement has resulted in significant job shifts,\" Altman acknowledged.\n\nHowever, Fung emphasized that while AI will replace some roles, it will also create new opportunities. \"A lot of jobs we have today didn\u2019t exist 100 years ago,\" she said, urging that what is important is to be prepared for change.\n\nShe suggested that education systems must adapt to prepare individuals and teach them \"what makes us human.\"\n\nShe said schools should teach people the \"collective wisdom of humanity\" such as philosophy, the arts, literature, science, and mathematics and advised people to become more critical, creative and knowledgeable to deter the effects of AI."
