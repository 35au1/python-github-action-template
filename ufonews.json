        "article_content": "When a rancher in New Mexico came across scattered pieces of an alleged UFO in 1947, the US Air Force gathered the debris for further examination. The entire controversy that followed is covered in detail in the episode titled \u2018The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 of Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries,\u2019 which also features interviews with various UFO enthusiasts. One of the prominent Ufologists in the UFO community, Kevin Randle, also talks about his views on the 1947 Roswell incident.\n\nKevin Randle is a Retired Lieutenant Colonel With Decades of Experience in the Army\n\nKevin Douglas Randle was born on June 4, 1949, into a loving household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. From his early days, he was ambitious and wanted to achieve great things in life. While he was in high school, his interest in UFOs and aliens rose so much that he began studying the subject in his free time. After graduating from high school, he went to the University of Iowa, where he studied journalism. Finding interest in psychology, Kevin then got his master\u2019s degree in the same and a Ph. D. from California Coast University. Expanding his knowledge in different subjects, he also got into the American Military University and earned a second master\u2019s degree in military studies.\n\nFulfilling his dream of serving his nation, Kevin became an integral part of the US Army in the Vietnam War as a helicopter pilot and in the Iraq War as a Battalion Intelligence Officer. He was also in the US Air Force, serving as a general\u2019s aide, a public affairs officer, as well as an intelligence officer. After completing his Air Force Reserve duty, he filled the position of an intelligence officer at the Iowa National Guard. For the courage he displayed on the battlefield while deployed in Iraq several times, he was given a Combat Action Badge. After serving his nation for numerous decades, Kevin retired from the Iowa National Guard as a Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nThe Successful Author Also Runs a UFO-Based Podcast Show\n\nIn order to feed his curiosity and passion for UFOs, Kevin also started writing for UFO magazines at a fairly young age. Having more than three decades of experience under his belt as a professional writer, he has written and published all kinds of write-ups, from science fiction and techno-thrillers to action-adventure and non-fiction. However, out of more than 80 books that he has written, Kevin is widely recognized for his books about the 1947 Roswell story and UFOs. Some of his popular books include \u2018The Roswell Encyclopedia,\u2019 \u2018A History of UFO Crashes,\u2019 \u2018Conspiracy of Silence,\u2019 and \u2018Project Moondust.\u2019\n\nBesides that, he has also co-authored books such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 and \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell.\u2019 Given his knowledge of the Roswell story and everything related to UFO, Dr. Kevin Douglas Randle is considered one of the leading researchers and experts on those subjects within the community of UFO enthusiasts. For nearly eight years, he has also been hosting a podcast series titled \u2018A Different Perspective with Kevin Randle,\u2019 where he interviews alleged UFO witnesses and gets them to talk about their purported encounters and experiences with the unknown. Currently, the renowned Ufologist resides in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and continues to focus on proving the existence of UFOs and aliens.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

        "article_content": "Q: We are seeking records on UFOs, and were told to try the Freedom of Information Act. First question, can you explain the Freedom of Information Act? Then, how do we go about requesting records?\n\nJ.V., Glendale\n\nA: The Freedom of Information Act (abbreviated as FOIA) provides you with the right to request access to records of the executive branch of the United States government. The records are to be provided, unless they are subject to certain exemptions whose purpose is to protect disclosure deemed harmful to: (a) national security, (b) privacy of individuals, (c) proprietary business information (such as trade secrets), (d) the actual functioning of our government, and/or (e) other interests that are deemed of significant importance. The exemptions are real, but FOIA requests often are productive.\n\nThe act dates from 1967 and took many years to become law. The objective is to make our government more transparent. As to UFOs (which the government now refers to as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d), federal agencies have been required this year to organize and tag documents. Congress has expressed clear interest in determining what agencies know about UFOs. Thus, the agencies are to disclose their information by the end of this fiscal year. The records are also to be housed at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of a FOIA request you can consider: Using letterhead, set forth the date you are sending it; then list the name and address of the executive agency where the request is being sent; then \u201cRE: FOIA REQUEST\u201d; followed by \u201cDear Sir or Madam: This is an authorized request to you under the Freedom of Information Act. Please provide the following records to the undersigned on a timely basis. \u2026\u201d Here, clearly set forth the records sought, describing them, if possible, by year(s), name of the party or parties involved, and/or the circumstances or events in focus. Then close the FOIA request with a sign off.\n\nNote that some agencies have instructions on where a FOIA request is to be sent (you can look for that online, or call to inquire). While it is not required that the FOIA request be transmitted by certified mail/return receipt requested, doing so is one way to seek to show that you not only sent it, but that it was received. The agency is required to respond within 20 working days (excluding weekends and legal holidays).\n\nQ: There was a local incident that at first was well reported. An older person was run over by a hit-and-run driver. We think they have since found the identity of the driver, who may be a local official, but there is radio silence. Our neighbor suggests we try a Public Records Act request. Can you give us some guidance on that?\n\nM.B., (location withheld)\n\nRelated Articles News | Am I liable for a slip and fall at a bowling alley?

Ask the lawyer A: The Public Records Act is found at California Government Code Sections 6250 through 6277. The act gives you, as a member of the public, the right to request information from California governmental agencies, which includes both state and local/municipal governments. In some instances, you may be able to learn online or by phone where to send the request, depending on which agency the request is going to (such as, the police department, highway patrol, zoning commission, district attorney\u2019s office or mayor\u2019s office, among others). As with a FOIA request, be specific about what you are seeking, and to whom and where the records are to be sent. The agency has 10 calendar days to respond to you, but may indicate it needs more time to locate, review and produce the records (which can mean a 14-day extension for \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d).\n\nAs with a FOIA request, some records may be deemed confidential or otherwise off-limits.\n\nA Public Records Act request, however, should not be costly or time consuming. It is the law, and compliance is expected to the extent authorized and permissible. I cannot say the request will unveil what you are looking for, and records you get may have redactions (which the agency can seek to justify), but, as they say, \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d\n\nRon Sokol has been a practicing attorney for over 40 years, and has also served many times as a judge pro tem, mediator, and arbitrator.

        "source": "TechCrunch",
        "article_content": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous week for OpenAI, full of executive departures and major fundraising developments, but the startup is back at it, trying to convince developers to build tools with its AI models at its 2024 DevDay. The company announced several new tools Tuesday, including a public beta of its \u201cRealtime API\u201d, for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. It\u2019s not quite ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, but it\u2019s close.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said the recent departures of chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief research officer Bob McGrew would not affect the company\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with saying Bob and Mira have been awesome leaders. I\u2019ve learned a lot from them, and they are a huge part of getting us to where we are today,\u201d said Weil. \u201cAnd also, we\u2019re not going to slow down.\u201d\n\nAs OpenAI undergoes yet another C-suite overhaul \u2013 a reminder of the turmoil following last year\u2019s DevDay \u2013 the company is trying to convince developers that it still offers the best platform to build AI apps on. Leaders say the startup has more than 3 million developers building with its AI models, but OpenAI is operating in an increasingly competitive space.\n\nOpenAI noted it had cut costs for developers to access its API by 99% in the last two years, though it was likely forced to by competitors such as Meta and Google continuously undercutting their prices.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s new features, dubbed the Realtime API, will give developers the chance to build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can\u2019t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. (The voice ambiguously based on Scarlett Johansson\u2019s is not available anywhere.)\n\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI\u2019s head of developer experience, Romain Huet, shared a demo of a trip planning app built with the Realtime API. The application allowed users to verbally speak with an AI assistant about an upcoming trip to London, and get low-latency responses. The Realtime API also has access to a number of tools, so the app was able to annotate a map with restaurant locations as it answered.\n\nAt another point, Huet showed how the Realtime API could speak on the phone with a human to inquire about ordering food for an event. Unlike Google\u2019s infamous Duo, OpenAI\u2019s API can\u2019t call restaurants or shops directly; however, it can integrate with calling APIs like Twilio to do so. Notably, OpenAI is not adding disclosures so that its AI models automatically identify themselves on calls like this, despite the fact that these AI-generated voices sounds quite realistic. For now, it seems to be the developers\u2019 responsibility to add this disclosure, something that could be required by a new California law.\n\nAs part of its DevDay announcements, OpenAI also introduced vision fine-tuning in its API, which will let developers use images, as well as text, to fine-tune their applications of GPT-4o. This should, in theory, help developers improve the performance of GPT-4o for tasks involving visual understanding. OpenAI\u2019s head of product API, Olivier Godement, tells TechCrunch that developers will not be able to upload copyrighted imagery (such as a picture of Donald Duck), images that depict violence, or other imagery that violates OpenAI\u2019s safety policies.\n\nOpenAI is racing to match what its competitors in the AI model licensing space already offer. Its prompt caching feature is similar to the feature Anthropic launched several months agoallowing developers to cache frequently used context between API calls, reducing costs and improve latency. OpenAI says developers can save 50% using this feature, whereas Anthropic promises a 90% discount for it.\n\nLastly, OpenAI is offering a model distillation feature to let developers use larger AI models, such as o1-preview and GPT-4o, to fine-tune smaller models such as GPT-4o mini. Running smaller models generally provides cost savings compared to running larger ones, but this feature should let developers improve the performance of those small AI models. As part of model distillation, OpenAI is launching a beta evaluation tool so developers can measure their fine-tune\u2019s performance within OpenAI\u2019s API.\n\nDevDay may make bigger waves for what it didn\u2019t announce. For instance, there wasn\u2019t any news about the GPT Store announced during last year\u2019s DevDay. Last we\u2019ve heard, OpenAI has been piloting a revenue share program with some of the most popular creators of GPTs, but the company hasn\u2019t shared much since then.\n\nAlso, OpenAI says it\u2019s not releasing any new AI models during DevDay this year. Developers waiting for OpenAI o1 (not the preview or mini version) or the startup\u2019s video generation model, Sora, will have to wait a little longer."

'Welcome back? Are you OK? Did you cross over OK? Did you go to the light? Are you happy? Do you feel better?'\"\n\nAngel was surprised to see how well the app was able to recreate Cameroun's personality, from his very specific taste in '90s R&B and gospel music to the style and vernacular of his text messages. According to Project December's co-creator Jason Rohrer, the app is an AI language model that requires very little information but has been trained on everything humans have written. A few quotes from an individual, or a few details about them, and the AI model can \" simulate the dead .\"\n\nAngel's experience is just one example in Eternal You that depicts people's search for closure through AI. The documentary explores how new technology like Project December and VR Experiment, which creates a virtual avatar of deceased loved ones, can help people \"connect with the dead.\" It also raises questions about the ethical consequences that can come with \"death capitalism.\"\n\nWhere to watch Eternal You\n\nEternal You premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nWatch now on CBC Gem and the CBC Docs YouTube channel."

After debuting in 1999, the story of softhearted Nana has prompted live-action movies, Hello Kitty collabs, and rabid TikTok fandom, but its success hasn't guaranteed Yazawa's other work the same star treatment.\n\nLast Quarter \u2013 Yazawa's supernatural shoujo manga from 1998 \u2013 has been lost to the English-speaking world until this fall when VIZ Media released the first in a two-book series of the manga's first English translation. Even though it's taken 26 years, I'm grateful that Last Quarter can finally brush off the cemetery dirt and get back onto dusty bookshelves. Its intoxicating suspense is a perfect example of what draws me to paranormal romance.\n\nIn the manga, Mizuki \u2013 with the Rapunzel hair and platform heels characteristic of a Yazawa heroine \u2013 meets Adam by chance. He's a moody musician, another Yazawa trademark, and impossible to resist, so Mizuki stops going to high school. \"The rest of my life\u2026belongs to you,\" she decides.\n\nArt from Last Quarter.\n\nBut life gets in the way. Though Mizuki is too in love to see it, something's wrong with Adam. His hands are freezing, and yet he leaves the windows wide open, for all of March's cold wind to curl through. He lives in an opulent apartment, but neighbors say it's been empty for decades, and when Mizuki ends up there alone, she discovers she can't leave. No one can hear her or see her, either, apart from a blue-eyed cat and the gracious fifth grader Hotaru, who Mizuki meets in a dream.\n\nSince the Jane Eyre days, two things have made a paranormal romance story really worthwhile: the man, and the mystery. I think Last Quarter is an emblematic paranormal romance because it excels at both.\n\nLike Mr. Rochester, like Edward, like Patrick Swayze in Ghost, Adam is beautiful and frightening in Last Quarter, as plausible as a monster as he is a husband. He doesn't appear often in book one, but his bright eyes make a lasting impression.\n\nArt from Last Quarter.\n\nAs French philosopher Roland Barthes writes in A Lover's Discourse, \"isn't desire always the same, whether the object is present or absent?\" Even after she's forgotten her own name, losing herself in days as repetitive as a nightmare, Mizuki still pines for Adam. She tasks Hotaru and her friends with bringing Adam back to her, declaring that, \"I don't care if Hell comes afterward. No matter how wonderful Heaven might be, if Adam isn't there, it would be meaningless to me.\"\n\nMizuki's body-aching desire for Adam and what he represents \u2013 adulthood, novelty, potential \u2013 dissolves whatever boundaries we, as readers, have separating our love from fear. That's always my favorite part of the paranormal romance experience, embracing every possibility of fear. In the unknown, I find red connective tissue and the unmistakable, metallic glint of excitement.\n\nI take the same away from Julietta Suzuki's 2022 manga series, Otaku Vampire's Love Bite, which Viz Media is also beginning to translate. In book one, released today, the perky Romanian vampire Hina has a crush on the gloomy human Amanatsu. He shares a sexy haircut and entire face with her favorite anime character, delectably blending reality and fiction.\n\nArt from Otaku Vampire's Love Bite.\n\nIt's a tantalizing mystery, the second ingredient in what I think is a winning paranormal romance story. And in Last Quarter, whose grayscale panels are often moonlit and melancholy, strangeness drives the plot more than a male protagonist with luscious hair. Little Hotaru is determined to help Mizuki rediscover her identity, and the truth of the dream-place where they first met. Was it purgatory? An omen?\n\nThrough Hotaru and Mizuki's intertwining and opaque fates, Last Quarter establishes a creeping anxiety as absorbing as its romantic elements. That's also what I find fascinating about Junji Ito's popular 1998 horror manga series Uzumaki . Unlike Last Quarter, Uzumaki has disproportionately more people spiraling in slimy agony than in thriving relationships. Its ending \u2013 and spoilers ahead \u2013 though, creates a satisfying combination of both; narrator Kirie and her boyfriend Shuichi collapse in a pile of dry and twisted corpses, holding each other close while their arms grow long and coil together.\n\nAs much as I enjoy mainstream horror manga's spilled blood and bloated bodies, I'm glad shoujo horror like Last Quarter is now starting to be translated. Aside from Uzumaki, it's rare that horror manga has a notable romance element, and when it does, it's often presented in the form of a misogynistic yandere crime scene. But Last Quarter protects the girls in its pages, subjecting them to the uncanny only in the context of tenderness. That's what I want from paranormal romance. It reminds me that nothing is pure, and nothing is doomed.\n\nStill in a manga mood? Check out our picks for the 10 best manga from 2023."

        "article_content": "The sinkholes likely formed through typical geological processes.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) has identified approximately 40 circular structures at the bottom of Lake Michigan, Live Science reported.\n\nIn 2022, NOAA researchers surveying the Great Lakes used sonar to detect unusual circular depressions on the lakebed. These depressions, measuring between 91 meters (300 feet) and 183 meters (600 feet) across, also caught the attention of a shipwreck hunter at the time, although scientists have only recently been able to examine them more closely.\n\nDuring an August expedition, the team discovered around 40 of these features, which are believed to be sinkholes. These formations were found approximately 22.5 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of Sheboygan, aligned in a line extending toward Port Washington.\n\n\"There were dozens of them in our search grid,\" said Brendon Baillod, the shipwreck hunter who first noticed them in 2022, in an interview with Live Science. \"Most ranged between 500 and 1,000 feet [152 to 309 meters] in diameter and were irregular in shape.\"\n\nThe sinkholes likely formed through typical geological processes.\n\n\"Sinkholes are most common in what geologists refer to as 'karst terrain',\" the US Geological Survey notes. \"In these regions, certain types of rock beneath the surface can naturally dissolve due to groundwater circulation. Soluble rocks include salt beds, gypsum, limestone, and other carbonate formations.\"\n\nLake Michigan's limestone bedrock helps explain the creation of these sinkholes. While their formation is straightforward, these structures are far from ordinary. Similar sinkholes in Lake Huron host unique microbial communities, thriving in oxygen-poor, sulfur-rich groundwater, resembling life on Earth about 2.5 billion years ago.\n\n\"Much like early Earth, microorganisms dominate the Middle Island Sinkhole in Lake Huron. Scientists recognize three major domains of life: Bacteria, known for their diversity and adaptability; Archaea, noted for their ability to survive in extreme conditions and produce methane; and Eukarya, which includes plants, animals, fungi, and protists,\" states a study on Lake Huron sinkholes.\n\nOn the lake floor, bacteria form a purple mat.\n\n\"DNA analysis revealed that the majority of the purple mat consists of Phormidium autumnale, a photosynthetic cyanobacterium. These filamentous organisms use light energy to convert dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic carbon.\"\n\nThese microorganisms are found in diverse environments, from Yellowstone National Park to Antarctica's ice-covered lakes.\n\n\"We also discovered methane-producing Archaea in the sediment and several Eukaryotic species within the mat. While many DNA sequences resemble known organisms, some represent novel and potentially undiscovered microbial life forms.\"\n\nFurther research at Lake Michigan is necessary to determine if it harbours similar life forms, though GLERL scientists told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they believe the sinkholes are similar to those in Lake Huron and may provide insights into early Earth conditions."

        "article_content": "The lending industry has been undergoing significant transformation in recent years, driven by shifts in consumer expectations, tighter regulations, and fierce competition. Traditional financial institutions are now facing pressure to innovate and streamline their lending processes, across loan origination, loan servicing and collections, while fintech companies are offering more agile and tailored solutions. In the midst of these changes, Low-Code, No-Code, and Pro-Code (LcNcPc) platforms have emerged as key enablers, allowing organisations to quickly adapt and launch new solutions in response to market demands. According to Gartner, growing enterprise wide hyper-automation and composable business initiatives to be the key drivers for adoption of low code technologies.\n\nThese platforms provide a flexible approach to application development. Low-Code and No-Code (LcNc) platforms empower non-technical users to create functional applications with minimal coding, while Pro-Code offers deeper customisation for more complex needs. This trifecta is accelerating the transformation in the lending industry, allowing both traditional institutions and fintech startups to meet consumer needs faster, reduce development costs and stay compliant with evolving regulations.\n\nPro-Code: Driving Customisation and Performance\n\nWhile Low-Code and No-Code platforms are designed to streamline application development and empower non-technical users, Pro-Code remains critical for financial institutions that need highly customised, secure, and scalable solutions. Here are the key benefits of incorporating Pro-Code into the LCNC platform:\n\nDeep Customisation for Complex Needs\n\nPro-Code allows institutions to build custom features that go beyond the pre-configured components available in Low-Code and No-Code environments. Banks and Financial Institutions (Fis), for instance, can use Pro-Code to create highly specific tools, such as customised risk assessment engines or dynamic pricing models, tailored to their unique business requirements. Scalability for Enterprise Solutions\n\nWhile Low-Code and No-Code platforms are excellent for rapid prototyping and building smaller applications, Pro-Code is essential for handling enterprise-level scale. Financial institutions often require complex systems capable of handling large volumes of transactions, real-time data processing, and high-level performance, all of which can be achieved with Pro-Code. Enhanced Security and Compliance\n\nPro-Code offers the flexibility to integrate advanced security features and customise compliance-related workflows. Financial institutions face stringent regulatory requirements, and Pro-Code platforms allow developers to build systems that meet these standards, such as custom encryption, advanced access controls, and compliance auditing. Complex Integrations\n\nPro-Code provides the capability to integrate with legacy systems, third-party applications, and APIs in a highly tailored manner. This ensures that banks can modernise their infrastructure without completely replacing their core systems, allowing for gradual digital transformation. Optimising AI/ML Models\n\nPro-Code allows banks to integrate advanced AI and machine learning models into their operations, providing predictive analytics, fraud detection, and data-driven decision-making tools. These customised models can enhance core functions like credit scoring, loan approvals, and personalised product recommendations, making operations smarter and more efficient.\n\nWhere GenAI Comes In\n\nThe rise of GenAI further enhances the capability of Low-Code, No-Code, and Pro-Code platforms, enabling businesses to build smarter, more adaptable tools. One of the most powerful ways to harness GenAI within LCNC platforms is through prompt engineering.\n\nPrompt Engineering: The Power to Build Without Code\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of using natural language inputs to interact with and guide GenAI systems. In the context of LCNC platforms, this means that users, regardless of technical expertise, can build, customise, and deploy applications simply by crafting precise prompts. Here are the key benefits of prompt engineering within LCNC platforms:\n\nFaster Tool Creation and Automation\n\nWith prompt engineering, users can rapidly create tools by instructing GenAI in plain language. For example, a user could input a prompt like, \u201cCreate a tool that automatically verifies loan applicants' income using bank statements,\u201d and the LCNC platform, powered by GenAI, will generate the necessary logic and workflows to achieve this. This significantly reduces development time and allows teams to automate complex tasks without writing any code. Democratising Development\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of prompt engineering is its ability to democratise application development. Business users, compliance officers, or customer service teams, who may not have coding skills, can still create functional applications by providing clear instructions through prompts. This empowers more people within a financial institution to contribute to the digital transformation process, leading to quicker innovation and responsiveness to market needs. Real-Time Customisations\n\nGenAI, when guided by well-structured prompts, can help users create tools that adapt in real-time to changing business conditions or customer needs. For instance, a bank can prompt GenAI to \u201cCreate a dynamic loan calculator that updates based on current market interest rates and customer credit scores,\u201d allowing the institution to offer tailored services at scale, without manual intervention. Seamless Integration and Flexibility\n\nPrompt engineering allows for the easy creation of connectors and integrations with legacy systems or third-party platforms. A simple prompt like, \u201cGenerate a tool to sync loan application data with the CRM system,\u201d can trigger GenAI to create the necessary APIs or data pipelines. This flexibility ensures that financial institutions can modernize their operations without overhauling their existing infrastructure, saving time and reducing dependency on external vendors. Enhanced Testing and Prototyping\n\nPrompt engineering enables rapid prototyping within the LCNC platform. By providing prompts such as, \u201cBuild a prototype for a risk assessment tool based on customer transaction history,\u201d teams can quickly generate working models, test them, and iterate as needed. This accelerates the innovation process and allows banks to quickly bring new ideas to market while maintaining high-quality standards. Cost Efficiency and Resource Optimisation\n\nBy reducing the need for deep technical resources and external development teams, prompt engineering directly contributes to cost efficiency. Non-technical teams can build, deploy, and update tools without the heavy costs associated with traditional software development. This frees up skilled developers to focus on more critical, high-value projects that require complex coding, while everyday tasks are handled through automated or semi-automated processes.\n\nThe Impact of LCNCPC Platforms on the Lending Industry\n\nThe financial landscape, especially in lending, is becoming increasingly competitive. Traditional banks and financial institutions (FIs) are under immense pressure to deliver faster, more personalised services while maintaining compliance with complex regulations. LCNCPC platforms offer significant advantages in key areas:\n\nCost Efficiency\n\nLCNCPC platforms significantly reduce development costs. No-Code and Low-Code solutions empower non-technical staff to develop applications, reducing the need for expensive IT resources. Pro-Code platforms allow specialised teams to focus on high-priority projects, streamlining operations and reducing overhead. Vendor Dependency\n\nVendor lock-in is a major concern for banks, but LCNCPC platforms provide a solution. Many platforms promote interoperability and modularity, allowing banks to integrate external APIs and build custom functionalities without relying entirely on one vendor. Pro-Code ensures that banks retain control over critical aspects of their systems. Swift Deployments\n\nSpeed to market is crucial in the financial industry. LCNCPC platforms allow rapid prototyping and deployment of digital solutions. With No-Code tools, banks can make adjustments to workflows or build small applications, enabling faster service rollouts, such as loan application portals or customer onboarding tools. Enhanced Customer Experience\n\nCustomer satisfaction in lending depends on simplicity and speed. LCNCPC platforms enable banks to create personalised, digital-first loan experiences. With GenAI, banks can further enhance this by analysing customer profiles and offering tailored loan options in real time. For instance, the platform can be used to design highly personalised loan repayment plans that cater to individual borrower needs, fostering customer loyalty. Compliance and Regulatory Adaptability\n\nAs regulatory changes continue to evolve, LCNCPC platforms help banks stay compliant. Low-Code and No-Code platforms allow for quick updates to workflows in response to new regulations. Pro-Code can be used to build advanced compliance monitoring and reporting systems. GenAI also plays a role in automating compliance checks and generating reports. Seamless Integration with Legacy Systems\n\nLCNCPC platforms integrate easily with existing legacy systems, allowing banks to modernise without overhauling their entire infrastructure. Low-Code platforms can bridge new digital services and traditional banking systems, while Pro-Code supports deeper integrations for more complex solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe emergence of Low-Code, No-Code, and Pro-Code platforms offers banks and financial institutions a powerful way to drive innovation, enhance customer experiences, and stay compliant with ever-evolving regulatory requirements. By adopting a phased approach, financial institutions can reap the benefits of new age lending technology with LcNcPc capabilities while minimising risks and controlling costs of their lending operations. Integrating GenAI further amplifies the efficiency and flexibility of these platforms, positioning the lending industry for a future where digital transformation is not just an option but a necessity."

It brings Poolside\u2019s total raised to $626 million; Bloomberg reports that the startup\u2019s valuation now sits at $3 billion.\n\nTechCrunch revealed this summer that Poolside was in the midst of raising substantial funding.\n\n\u201cWe believe software development will be the first broad capability where AI will reach and surpass human-level intelligence,\u201d Poolside CEO Jason Warner said in a press release. \u201cThrough our team, our applied research, and a powerful revenue engine, poolside will bring AI for software development so that anyone in the world can build.\u201d\n\nU.S.- and Europe-based Poolside was founded in 2023 by Warner and Eiso Kant, both of whom are software engineers. Warner is the former CTO of GitHub, having also headed engineering orgs at Canonical and Heroku. Kant previously co-founded several dev-focused startups, including engineering analytics venture Athenian.\n\nWarner, who incubated GitHub\u2019s AI-powered Copilot tool, met Kant in 2017. Over the next six years, the pair plotted an AI-driven assistive tool suite for devs, which became Poolside.\n\nPoolside develops its own AI models to help with tasks like autocompleting code and suggesting code possibly relevant to a particular context or codebase \u2014 much like other AI assistive coding tools. The company\u2019s customers are primarily Global 2000 companies and public-sector agencies.\n\nThe Series B funding allowed Poolside to bring 10,000 Nvidia GPUs online to train future models, Warner said, and to bolster the company\u2019s go-to-market and R&D efforts.\n\nDespite the security, copyright and reliability concerns around AI-powered assistive coding tools, developers have shown enthusiasm for them, with the vast majority of respondents in GitHub\u2019s latest poll saying that they\u2019ve adopted AI tools in some form. GitHub reported in April that Copilot had over 1.8 million paying users and more than 50,000 business customers.\n\nEncouraged by the adoption, AI coding startups are raising big bucks. Generative AI coding firm Magic landed $320 million in August \u2014 the same day GitHub Copilot competitor Codeium closed a $150 million funding round. Earlier in August, Cognition, best known for its viral coding assistant called Devin, secured $175 million at a $2 billion valuation.\n\nPolaris Research projects that the AI coding tools market could be worth some $27 billion by 2032.\n\nLG Technology Ventures, Felicis Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Citi Ventures, Capital One Ventures, HSBC Ventures, DST Global, StepStone Group, Schroders Capital, Premji Invest, Dorsal Capital, BAM Elevate, Adams Street, and Fin Capital also invested in Poolside\u2019s Series B."
