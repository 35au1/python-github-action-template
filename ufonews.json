            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 explores the reality behind the supposed existence of extraterrestrial beings through the alleged experiences of several former and retired US Army officials, including Jason Sands. The UFO whistleblower served in the Air Force as a master sergeant before concluding his career in 2007. As per reports, he is also one of the numerous individuals who have spoken to former intelligence official and whistleblower David Grusch about allegedly encountering UFOs. Jason\u2019s claims have shaken the online communities and platforms that study UAPs. Interestingly, his experience of allegedly meeting an alien, as he revealed in the documentary, forms one of the most detailed and vivid accounts delivered by a whistleblower in recent times! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nJason Sands Served 22 Years in the Air Force\n\nJason Sands joined the US Air Force in 1985. His discharge/release certificate states that his primary specialties were electronic system security assessment and aircraft structural maintenance. However, after emerging as a UFO whistleblower, he claimed that he was part of several top-secret programs within the Air Force. In an interview given in April 2024, he alleged that one of his duties concerned understanding technology captured from non-human intelligence (NHI). He further added that he was a member of the \u201cRed Team,\u201d which was committed to monitoring exchanges between scientists, which apparently concerned numerous alien races at times. Despite these claims, there isn\u2019t any evidence in the public domain to prove that he was part of any missions that targeted extraterrestrial activity.\n\nJason\u2019s life supposedly turned around in 1994 when he allegedly met an extraterrestrial being while driving through the Nellis Air Force Base Complex in Nevada. As detailed in \u2018The Program,\u2019 he witnessed the apparent entity disappearing from Earth in a peculiar-looking craft. He shared this unverified experience with the documentarian James Fox, paving the way for his inclusion in the project. After meeting the former Air Force officer, the filmmaker investigated the claims and details concerning his tenure, only to be convinced about his credibility. After collaborating with Jason on the documentary, Fox accidentally revealed the former\u2019s identity, only for him to emerge as a whistleblower.\n\nJason Sands\u2019 Allegations and Claims Are Highly Contested\n\nJason Sands has been a significant presence in the online UFO research community since April 2024. He garnered immense attention with his claim of meeting an alien in 1994 and being part of several secret government programs. In an interview, he reportedly said he joined a UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomenon) task force forum in 2021 to contribute his supposed knowledge concerning \u201cblack projects.\u201d Even though many have accepted him and his words, several others have approached the same with critical eyes. After Jason released his Air Force release/discharge certificate in April 2024, a former UFO enthusiast raised suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in extraterrestrial research, which are not indicated in the \u201cproof\u201d he shared.\n\nFurthermore, in an interview with Spaced Out Radio in April 2024, Jason claimed he was \u201cforced to serve\u201d in the \u201c20 and Back Program.\u201d As per reports, it was described as a program in which participants spent 20 years in a Secret Space Program (SSP) to interact with extraterrestrial beings and visit military bases across the solar system. In 2022, a whistleblower named Corey Goode admitted that he fabricated the entire program to take advantage of his fans financially. Jason\u2019s alleged involvement in a fictional program turned numerous UFO enthusiasts against him, forcing him to describe the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. He stated in April 2024 that \u201c20 and Back\u201d was an \u201cexperience\u201d for him rather than one official program.\n\nSimilarly, Jason\u2019s claim that he heard scientists discussing multiple alien races has also been scrutinized. In March 2024, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense published a report about the US government\u2019s involvement with UAP. The same offers insights about test and evaluation units with a nickname with \u2018alien\u2019 connotations, which can be what Jason apparently heard as an alleged member of the \u201cRed Team.\u201d\n\nJason Sands is Involved in the UAP Discourse While Working as a Consultant Today\n\nAs discussions and debates concerning Jason Sands\u2019 claims and allegations grow, he has been working as an independent consultant for the Department of Defense since August 2024. The whistleblower is currently based in Gaithersburg, a city in Montgomery County, Maryland. While he remains a popular figure in the UFO research community, he has chosen to keep his family away from the spotlight, which is understandable considering the scrutiny he faces day after day. The backlash he deals with has only increased following his inclusion in James Fox\u2019s \u2018The Program.\u2019 The recent reactions against Jason can be traced back to an interview he gave to Post Disclosure World, a YouTube channel dedicated to UFO news, in December 2024.\n\nWhen asked about his experiences as an Air Force officer, Jason alleged that he was forced to do some \u201cdirty work,\u201d which mainly involved killing \u201cNHI,\u201d also known as non-human intelligence. He went on to explain that he had to do it because he was informed that \u201cbad things\u201d would happen to him or his family if he didn\u2019t comply. The online UFO research community immensely scrutinized the whistleblower\u2019s \u201calien assassin\u201d claim. The credibility he garnered since his emergence as a first-hand witness of alleged alien existence was severely affected within a day. Even James Fox, who initially backed Jason, expressed his disbelief.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastates his credibility. But I still believe that encounter may have happened based on the background digging I did, but yeah, that\u2019s not good for his credibility,\u201d Fox shared. Irrespective of the backlash Jason continues to receive, he remains a sensational figure when it comes to alien discourse. Since April 2024, he has given numerous interviews and appeared on several podcasts to explain his claims. He is also one of the advocates of a comprehensive Congressional investigation into UAP within the jurisdiction of the US government. As \u2018The Program\u2019 sheds light on the possible existence of extraterrestrial beings, we can look forward to more clarity concerning Jason\u2019s credibility and his claims\u2019 authenticity.\n\nRead More: Darrell Livengood: Where is the Alleged UFO Witness Now?"

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

            "article_content": "The information was impressive enough, but the visualisation was the really impressive bit. It was far more powerful than any 1400-word block of text could ever be.\n\nGet your life (and marriage) in order\n\nMen might be doing more of the chores than they used to but they\u2019re still way behind on what\u2019s known as \u201cthe mental load\u201d: the planning, co-ordinating, scheduling, organising, assigning and following up on all the thousands of tasks big and small needed to make a family work.\n\nA recent NZ Herald headline put it this way: \u201cBeing CEO of the household is weighing women down and hurting relationships\u201d.\n\nIt told of a UC Berkeley study, which found: \u201cWomen reported being responsible for 73% of the cognitive labour, leading them to feel stressed, depressed, burned out and dissatisfied with their relationship\u201d.\n\nA bevy of AI-based apps is now available that might be able to help with this. Apps like Gether, Goldee and Jam allow you to forward emails and other correspondence to an email address where AI detects your family\u2019s names and automatically schedules their events in your and their calendars, and assigns people to the right tasks.\n\nThe tech isn\u2019t all the way there yet, still requiring some manual inputs, but it\u2019s a massive leap forward. The question is: will this get more men involved in the mental labour or just make them feel better that things are slightly easier for their partners?\n\nMake yourself happier\n\nThe amount of research on happiness and how to improve it has grown exponentially in the past 20 years, to the point where it\u2019s become impossible to know what to do with it, or even where to start. Imagine if you could feed all that information into an AI and have it create you a plan for how to live the perfect life. Well you can\u2019t, but you can get closer than ever before.\n\nThere are many platforms that allow you to upload files and get AI to answer your questions, give you insights and do all sorts of other cool things. The one that\u2019s getting most of the attention is Google\u2019s NotebookLM, probably partly because it\u2019s Google, partly because it\u2019s very good, partly because it\u2019s free.\n\nI took thousands of words of research from positive psychology research repository the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley, fed them into NotebookLM and asked it to construct a plan that would maximise my wellbeing in 2025. Here\u2019s its top-line summary:\n\nMorning:\n\nMindfulness meditation (5-10 minutes):\n\nGratitude journaling (5 minutes):\n\nPurpose check-in (5 minutes):\n\nAfternoon:\n\nSocial Connection Break (10 minutes):\n\nAwe Walk (5 minutes):\n\nEvening:\n\nAltruism Hour (15 minutes):\n\nReflect and Plan (5 minutes):\n\nWeekly practices:\n\nGratitude letter (once a week):\n\nSocial gathering (once or twice a week):\n\nAwe-inspiring experience (once a week):\n\nI\u2019m sharing it with you as part of my altruism hour. In return, perhaps you could write me a gratitude letter.\n\nMake more money\n\nApps such as Venture Planner, LivePlan and VentureKit allow you to write a sentence or two about some vague moneymaking idea, click some boxes and come out with a full, extremely impressive-sounding (and looking) business plan.\n\nNo ideas? No worries! Ask ChatGPT or some other LLM what they suggest, then cut and paste into Venture Planner.\n\nWant some extra cash but can\u2019t be bothered with all the hassle and expense of a startup?\n\nWrite a few sentences about something you know something about, and platforms like Teachable or Heights can instantly turn it into an online course, including full lesson plans, with which you can then spam your friends on social media.\n\nWho knows? Maybe someone will pay you for it.\n\nI set up a writing course up in less than 10 minutes, including detailed lesson plans and a full website including pictures of happy families I\u2019d never seen who were presumably delighted by my valueless course they\u2019d never heard of.\n\nGoogle is developing a raft of AI tools. Can they help you change your life?\n\nWin more arguments\n\nWant to give someone a piece of your mind about the issues of the day, but you\u2019ve clicked on a bunch of studies you thought would prove your point and you\u2019ve got no idea what they mean?\n\nI gave NotebookLM three papers and one book about education in New Zealand and asked it for talking points that could be used for a talkback radio call complaining about the dire state of Kiwi kids\u2019 reading.\n\nIt responded with 10 ideas, every one of them excellent.\n\nThe first read: \u201cOver a third of 15-year-olds in New Zealand struggle to read and write. This is a shocking statistic uncovered by Unicef in 2020. This isn\u2019t just about acing exams \u2013 poor literacy is linked to poorer health, lower incomes, and even criminal activity. Something needs to change!\u201d\n\nI could feel the phone lines lighting up even before I\u2019d reached the exclamation mark.\n\nTalk to your future self\n\n\u201cFuture You\u201d is a project from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which helps you create a 65-year-old chatbot version of yourself and chat with it about any topic you like: existential dread, disappointment at the state of the world, general sense of ennui and so on. An initial study into the project reported all sorts of benefits for users, including decreased anxiety, improved mental health and better academic performance.\n\nSide note: The project is targeted at younger people, who have had far less time to become worn down by life.\n\nSave on therapy\n\nMental health chatbots are suddenly everywhere.\n\nTheir MO is generally therapy 101: they ask you how you\u2019re feeling, then offer \u201cempathy\u201d, then conclude with potential coping strategies. Some studies have shown these bots to have promise, and while it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019re as good as real therapy for your mental health, they\u2019re definitely much better for your financial health.\n\nWhen I told Earkick about my many stresses and anxieties, it suggested using \u201cmicro breaks\u201d for a five-step mindfulness practice (\u201cPause and acknowledge, find your breath, focus on the present, let go of thoughts, return to your breath\u201d) which, while not groundbreaking, cost me $150 less than the almost identical advice I once paid $150 an hour for.\n\nGet a job\n\nEmployers have been using AI to screen you out of your dream job for years, so it\u2019s only fair that you can now use AI to beat them at their own game.\n\nApps like Jobscan, Kickresume and Job Copilot allow you to find jobs, build your CV and write cover letters that can beat the screening systems, all with a minimum of effort. Some of them will even auto-apply for jobs on your behalf.\n\nPro tip: tell AI to include in your application the fact that AI created your job application, demonstrating to employers both your technical prowess and your ruthless commitment to productivity.\n\nIt\u2019s not just CVs AI can help with. The career-help corner of the AI universe is booming. I used a free tool from Taplio to critique my LinkedIn profile. It was both surprisingly good and crushingly brutal and led me to make several changes. I also asked it to assess the LinkedIn profile of Bill Gates. It criticised his failure to include his key skills.\n\nChange the world\n\nI googled \u201chow to change the world\u201d, found 20-30 research papers, articles and even books, fed them into NotebookLM, then asked it for answers. It produced 1000 well-researched, erudite and occasionally inspiring words, but right now you probably just want the key points:\n\n1. Identify problems that resonate with you.\n\n2. Deconstruct the problem and understand the context.\n\n3. Embrace experimentation and learning.\n\n4. Become a \u201cchangemaker\u201d by cultivating essential skills: these include empathy, vision, initiative, resourcefulness, persistence.\n\n5. Join or support existing organisations.\n\n6. Promote a culture of change in your own sphere of influence.\n\n7. Remember that building state capability takes time and collaboration."

And small language models will also likely come into their own, addressing specific tasks without overburdening data center processing and power.\n\nOrganizations will also adopt new technologies and architectures to better govern data and AI, with a return to predictive AI, according to Forrester Research."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s two years since the launch of ChatGPT-3, and we\u2019ve learnt so much along the way.\n\nWe now know, for example, that Hillary Clinton was the first female president of the United States, righting a historical wrong. Generative AI has given us recipes for spaghetti dishes using petrol as an ingredient, and told us that for our dietary health, we should try to remember to eat one small pebble a day.\n\nMy favourite: astronauts \u201chave met cats on the moon, played with them, and provided care\u201d, according to Google. Apparently, that is what Neil Armstrong was really referring to when he spoke about \u201cone small step\u201d \u2013 it was a cat\u2019s. How foolish of us not to notice what was, in retrospect, a pretty big clue from Nasa about the feline conquest of space.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory turns out to be full of other surprises. Both the Viking marauders of medieval Europe, and the Wehrmacht in the Second World War had commendable diversity policies, as many members were ethnically black or American Indian, as drawn by Google.\n\nAI has been trying its hand at improving educational standards. It insists there are two occurrences of the letter \u2018r\u2019 in the word \u2018strawberry\u2019, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you anything else.\n\nI\u2019m occasionally asked about my 2013 book, \u2018The Goolag: How Google\u2019s Empire Is Changing the World\u2019, which ChatGPT includes in my career summaries, and flatteringly describes as a \u2018notable work\u2019. I regret to inform readers that no such book exists, or anything like it, by me or anyone else. It is one of several works wrongly attributed to me.\n\nNow Apple has entered the fray, bringing \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 to iPhones. It can\u2019t do any worse, can it? It\u2019s Apple. Alas, it\u2019s already told us that the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been arrested for war crimes (wrong) and that the alleged assassin of a prominent American health industry executive committed suicide in his cell (wrong). Both stories were attributed to the BBC, which wasn\u2019t very happy.\n\nGoogle was forced to apologise after its AI chatbot generated a black Nazi and native American Vikings\n\nNevertheless, lucky Americans will soon be able to dial a freephone number (it\u2019s 1-800-CHATGPT) and get content of this quality read out to them.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people pay good money to be abused down a phone line \u2013 London\u2019s public telephone kiosks were once stuffed with cards promoting such services \u2013 so perhaps this is not that new. But it\u2019s a sober reminder that the statistical guesswork underlying the Large Language Models (LLMs), often leads to terrible results, called \u201challucinations\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t blame the AI companies entirely for this. Over-hyping and over-selling a technology is just what they do today. They take no more responsibility for the consequences than the scorpion in the fable that wants to hitch a lift from a frog to cross a river, promises not to sting it but does so anyway, drowning them both.\n\nOnly, unlike in the fable, the scorpions of Silicon Valley always seem to be able to get to the other side, where they just start all over again. If there\u2019s a problem, you can be sure they won\u2019t be around to help clean it up.\n\nJust as much responsibility should go on those of us who insist on deploying technology where it isn\u2019t appropriate. Due diligence flies out of the window.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, Tony Blair urges us to spend billions on AI to improve the efficiency of the NHS, automating rather than replacing the vast layers of bureaucracy.\n\nDominic Cummings now indulges in wild fantasies about teams of chatbots replacing the real voters who today take part in focus groups. He even imagines these hallucinations being fed directly into another AI to produce campaign material. Cummings has spent so long in the company of the snake oil salesmen of Silicon Valley he appears to think everyone else is stupid.\n\nWhen AI is deployed judiciously, it can be very useful indeed. Machine learning has proved a valuable tool in data analysis, finding patterns in masses of data. Where the errors are inconsequential, such as in many applications of signal and image processing, it has become well established. The text-munching research assistants aren\u2019t quite there yet, but they should improve.\n\nThe problem for the technology industry is that you can\u2019t conjure up a massive stock market bubble, or have the political class hanging on your every word, if you\u2019re flogging software that is \u201cactually sometimes quite useful\u201d. It\u2019s just not revolutionary enough, and that\u2019s become the only way they know how to sell their wares.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur credulity has been noted for decades. In the 1960s, a computer scientist called Joseph Weizenbaum developed two very successful chat programmes, ELIZA and DOCTOR, and the response of users astonished him. People talked for hours, spilling their secrets to the software. It was their over-trusting reaction, not the technology, that turned Weizenbaum from an AI advocate to a technology sceptic.\n\nSimon Willison, a widely followed British developer in Silicon Valley, reminds us that \u201cLLMs are useful tools for thought (but) terrible tools for delegating decision-making to. Any time someone outsources actual decision making authority to an opaque random number generator [it] is a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nQuite a lot of people aren\u2019t paying attention to the experts. Early in 2024 the trusty Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) lobbed out a report which reliably generated a Guardian headline: \u201cAI \u2018apocalypse\u2019 could take away almost 8m jobs in UK, says report\u201d. Goldman Sachs said 300m globally the year before.\n\nBut in fact you\u2019d have to be crazy to let an AI system actually sign off on anything, as we\u2019ve seen. If AI takes your job this year, you\u2019ll probably get hired back very quickly when your boss realises the mistake he or she\u2019s made. If your boss has been replaced by an AI too, he or she will get hired back first.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe used to be far more discerning. A quite remarkable presentation was rediscovered recently, created at IBM in the late 1970s. It was a set of rules the software developers should follow. \u201cA computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision,\u201d it advised. Other instructions were just as emphatic. \u201cA MANDATE WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IS AN ELEGANT FORM OF SUICIDE\u201d is one instruction.\n\nIt\u2019s a message from another era, from a less cynical but more far responsible generation of technologists \u2013 one more concerned about human welfare than with just getting rich quick.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

            "article_content": "From border narratives that go beyond the immigration debate to coming-of-age quasi-musicals with puppets; from a western that confronts Chile\u2019s dark past to an adaptation of one of Mexico\u2019s most revered novels, 2024 was truly a banner year for Latino and Latin American cinema. Below are the films that stuck with us over the last 12 months.\n\n20. The Casagrandes Movie\n\nThe delightfully cartoony Mexican American family at the center of this beloved Nickelodeon show embarks on their biggest adventure yet when Ronnie Anne (voiced by Izabella Alvarez), the series\u2019 rowdy heroine, celebrates her 12th birthday. Forced to travel to a picturesque town in Michoac\u00e1n, she encounters a supernatural entity who proves mother-daughter conflicts have existed since ancient times. Director Miguel Puga took inspiration from P\u2019urh\u00e9pecha culture and his memories spending summers in Jacona, Michoac\u00e1n, for a vision of Mexico that\u2019s not generic, but founded on specific personal ties.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\n19. Going Varsity in Mariachi\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from common extracurriculars, many Texas high schools have the option for students to join competitive mariachi bands. Classic tunes like \u201cMexico Lindo y Querido\u201d or \u201cEl Rey\u201d are reinvigorated in the hands and voices of young people. The teens that comprise the Mariachi Oro from Edinburgh North High School in the Rio Grande Valley \u2014 as well as their teacher Abel Acu\u00f1a \u2014 serve as the subjects for this look at how this genre of traditional Mexican music enables them to build community, boost their self-confidence and assert their pride in their heritage. Through every performance, culture perseveres.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\n18. Pedro P\u00e1ramo\n\nThree-time Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto takes on his first feature as a director with this reimagining of Juan Rulfo\u2019s seminal novel set partially during the Mexican Revolution. Juan Preciado (Tenoch Huerta) steps into the ghostly town of Comala to fulfill a promise he made to his deceased mother. Once upon a time, his wealthy father, the eponymous Pedro P\u00e1ramo (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) ruled these parts like a tyrant. Now, Juan must confront the specters of those hurt by the dad he never knew. It\u2019s a tale about how both benevolence and violence reverberate across generations, almost inescapably.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\n17. M\u00fasica\n\nTalented multi-hyphen Rudy Mancuso co-wrote, directed, and starred in this somewhat autobiographical debut where he plays a younger version of himself living with his mother (played by his real-life parent) in New Jersey\u2019s Brazilian American community. As he wrestles with the pressure of pursuing a traditional career or following his dream of creating a musical comedy show with puppets, he falls for the more grounded Isabella (Camila Mendes). This blend of practical set pieces, humorous tunes, and visual depictions of how Rudy\u2019s mind interprets every sound is an idiosyncratic marvel.\n\nStreaming on Prime\n\n16. Frida\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of films that tackle the tragedy-ridden life of painter Frida Kahlo, whose image has now become clich\u00e9d iconography. But Peruvian-born editor-turned-director Carla Gutierrez takes a distinct approach in this documentary: she allows Kahlo to speak for herself. Narrated mostly in the first person, this portrait takes its text directly from the artist\u2019s diaries and cleverly uses animation to bring her mind-bending works to life. In the voice of Fernanda Echevarr\u00eda, an often foul-mouthed and occasionally vulnerable Frida emerges to discuss heartbreak, passion, and how she used creation to exorcise her pain.\n\nStreaming on Prime\n\n15. In Her Place\n\nFollowing her two Oscar-nominated documentaries \u201cThe Mole Agent\u201d and \u201cThe Eternal Memory,\u201d Chilean filmmaker Maite Alberdi dives into a fiction based on the real-life story of a writer, Mar\u00eda Carolina Geel (Francisca Lewin), who killed her lover in the 1950s. Though she wanted to serve her sentence, the system absolved her solely because of her gender. Through the eyes of Mercedes (Elisa Zulueta), a married mother working for the judge on the case, Alberdi explores how patriarchal societies push women into nearly inescapable domestic roles. In Mar\u00eda Carolina\u2019s empty apartment, Mercedes finds a taste of freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\n14. Queens (Reinas)\n\nA father\u2019s fantastical tall tales aim to ease the pain of separation in this auspicious first feature inspired by director Klaudia Reynicke\u2019s childhood in 1990s Lima, Peru. As the South American nation undergoes an economic and political crisis, the whimsical parent in question, Carlos (a fantastic Gonzalo Molina), spends time with his daughters \u2014 teenage Aurora (Luana Vega) and the younger Luc\u00eda (Abril Gjurinovic) \u2014 in the days before they move to the U.S. with his ex-wife. Undeniably flawed, but also genuinely invested in forging a strong bond with the girls (his reinas), Carlos manages to leave a lasting impression.\n\nComing to VOD soon\n\n13. Rita\n\nGenre tropes allowed filmmaker Jayro Bustamante to discuss the genocide of Indigenous people in his native Guatemala via the political horror thriller \u201cLa Llorona.\u201d His follow-up stays in the same otherworldly wavelength to shine a light on a tragedy that involved dozens of young girls back in 2017. Thirteen-year-old Rita (Giuliana Santa Cruz) escapes her abusive home only to be sent to a reformatory where physical and sexual violence are the norm. Wearing a pair of feathered wings, Rita becomes a catalyst for a plan to liberate all the captive youths in this institution and expose the abhorrent treatment they\u2019ve received.\n\nStreaming on Shudder\n\n12. Los Frikis\n\nIn order to survive, hundreds of young Cuban outcasts knowingly contracted the HIV virus in the 1990s, during what\u2019s known as the \u201cspecial period.\u201d Their status granted them access to isolated sanatoriums in the countryside where food and safety were guaranteed. Paco, a punk rocker played by a ferocious H\u00e9ctor Medina, is among those who take this drastic measure and is sent away. His na\u00efve younger brother, Gustavo (Eros de la Puente), finds a way to join him, and for a while the two enjoy a paradisiacal, summer-camp-like freedom. Adria Arjona, previously seen in \u201cHit Man,\u201d plays a kindhearted caretaker.\n\nPlaying in theaters\n\n11. Eureka\n\nBoundary-pushing Argentine auteur Lisandro Alonso weaves an ambitious triptych traveling across the Americas and across centuries to examine the experiences of Indigenous peoples in the aftermath of colonization. Viggo Mortensen, one of Alonso\u2019s recurrent collaborators, stars as a father searching for his daughter in the first segment set in the Old West, which cleverly gives way to present-day South Dakota, and eventually to the Brazilian Amazon a few decades in the past. The thought-provoking, if ever enigmatic picture demands that one succumb to its unhurried pace and unexpected formal surprises.\n\nAvailable on VOD\n\n10. Problemista\n\nAspiring toy designer Alejandro (Julio Torres) moved from his native El Salvador to New York City to pursue his unconventional career. After not landing a dream internship, he must face the labyrinthine U.S. immigration system. In order to stay, the mild-mannered young man takes a job assisting Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton), an eccentric and acerbic artist who promises to sponsor him for a green card. The latest brainchild from the creator of \u201cLos Espookys\u201d is a one-of-a-kind immigrant story overflowing with imagination, absurdist humor, and incisive commentary about a system built to crush the most vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreaming on Max / Available on VOD\n\n9. The Human Surge 3\n\nAs disorienting as it is revelatory, this experimental work quite literally expands our relationship to the moving image since it was filmed with a 360-degree VR camera that floats through the spaces with an immersive fluidity. Behind this conceptual feat\u2014a sequel to his 2016 \u201cThe Human Surge\u201d (there\u2019s no part two)\u2014is Argentine visionary Eduardo Williams. This time around he follows straggling young people in Peru, Taiwan, and Sri Lanka, first separately until the geographical distance between them collapses and their timelines overlap. The last sequence is an astonishing optical illusion to behold.\n\nAvailable on VOD\n\n8. Chronicles of a Wandering Saint\n\nObsessively religious Rita (M\u00f3nica Villa) wants a miracle, and she is willing to fidget with the truth in order to make others in her remote Argentine town believe it\u2019s manifested through her. Halfway through her deceitful plan, writer-director Tom\u00e1s G\u00f3mez Bustillo (himself a Catholic missionary turned filmmaker) drops a twist that alters the course of this fascinatingly original narrative and moves it into the realm of the paranormal where flesh-and-bone demons, talking objects, and the terms and conditions of the afterlife coexist with the living \u2014 even if the latter don\u2019t realize it.\n\nAvailable on VOD\n\n7. Hummingbirds\n\nLiving in the border town of Laredo, Texas, two Mexican American best friends, Silvia Del Carmen Casta\u00f1os and Estefan\u00eda \u201cBeba\u201d Contreras, co-directed this luminous dual self-portrait about the uncertainty and possibility of the future as queer activists from economically underprivileged backgrounds. Being undocumented, Contreras worries about her limited prospects. Together they mine wonder from the everyday and turn it into music and poetry inspired by the places and the people they\u2019ve known their whole lives, and most importantly by the bond they\u2019ve forged with one another through \u201clo bueno y lo malo.\u201d\n\nComing to VOD soon\n\n6. In the Summers\n\nPuerto Rican music star Residente (credited as Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Joglar) stuns with a visceral performance in this Sundance-winning drama as a troubled father who tries to make the most out of the limited time he has with his daughters each year. Told over three distinct segments where the girls are played by different actors as they get older \u2014 Sasha Calle and Lio Mehiel embody them as adults \u2014 this subtle, humanistic debut by Colombian American writer-director Alessandra Lacorazza traces the evolution of the parent-children relationship traversing bumps, highlights, resentment and ultimately forgiveness.\n\nAvailable on VOD\n\n5. La Cocina\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA barrage of orders is deployed inside a Times Square restaurant where a battalion of cooks and waitresses from around the globe perform with chaotic precision. There, Pedro (Ra\u00fal Briones), an undocumented Mexican immigrant, prepares dishes and dishes out snarky remarks with a suave demeanor, bordering on arrogance. When money goes missing just as his girlfriend Julia (Rooney Mara) decides to have an abortion, Pedro begins unraveling in monumental fashion. This black-and-white adaptation of Arnold Wesker\u2019s \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d confronts how capitalism ensures the American Dream goes forever unfulfilled for many.\n\n4. Pictures of Ghosts\n\nCinema is a profoundly personal affair for Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho. At once a tribute to the bygone movie palaces of his hometown of Recife, and an introspective self-examination focused on his relationship with film, this evocative documentary is a must-see for all cinephiles. Images of the home where he grew up, and where his love and practice for visual storytelling were born, collide with footage he shot in the 1990s when those local theaters were still enticing crowds \u2014 one of them, the S\u00e3o Luiz, survives. The amalgamation of memory, historical fact and artifice yield an engrossing incantation.\n\nStreaming on Criterion Channel / Available on VOD\n\n3. The Settlers\n\nThe blood-soaked history of Chile \u2014 not dissimilar from that of most post-colonial nations \u2014 receives a searing filmic indictment in this striking western. Hired by a wealthy man to eliminate Indigenous people from \u201chis land,\u201d a pathetic British soldier (Mark Stanley), a ruthless American cowboy (Benjamin Westfall) and an ambivalent young Chilean mestizo (Camilo Arancibia) embark on a violent odyssey. The horrors they commit unveil the poisonous truth about the country\u2019s origin myth. There\u2019s such bold assurance in the writing and execution of this epic, it\u2019s hard to believe this is director Felipe G\u00e1lvez Haberle\u2019s very first feature.\n\nStreaming on Mubi/ Available on VOD\n\n2. I\u2019m Still Here\n\nWith titanic restraint, seasoned actress Fernanda Torres delivers the best performance of the year as Eunice Paiva, a mother of five whose politically involved husband disappears during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s. Based on the book Marcelo Rubens Paiva wrote about his own family, the drama by director Walter Salles introduces the dynamics of this tight-knit household with an ensemble cast that makes their interactions feel lived-in and authentic. Torres\u2019 Oscar-worthy turn conveys both the sorrow of the circumstances and then inner strength Eunice required to fight for justice and fend off despair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReturning to theaters Jan. 17\n\n1. Sujo\n\nFighting to not repeat his father\u2019s mistakes, Sujo (Juan Jes\u00fas Varela), the teenage son of a murdered sicario, leaves Michoac\u00e1n for Mexico City. And while he can\u2019t escape the vast economic disparity that plagues Mexican society, his curiosity for learning might turn into an opportunity to forge a new path forward. Co-directors Astrid Rondero and Fernanda Valadez, the brilliant duo behind 2020\u2019s \u201cIdentifying Features\u201d and two of the most important storytellers in Mexican cinema today, never trivialize the obstacles that young men like their protagonist face, but they allow themselves to dream an alternative, cautiously optimistic outcome to his story. If you see only one 2024 film set against the backdrop of the drug war that afflicts Mexico, make sure it\u2019s this one.\n\nPlaying in theaters"

            "article_content": "The youth advocacy group Encode is supporting Musk's lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction that would stop OpenAI from becoming fully for-profit.\n\nAn increasingly diverse coalition is forming in opposition to OpenAI\u2019s plan to restructure itself into a fully for-profit company.\n\nOn Monday, Encode, a youth-led advocacy organization representing young people in dozens of countries, filed an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk\u2019s ongoing lawsuit to stop OpenAI\u2019s corporate metamorphosis. The filing came with support from one of the biggest names in the field, Nobel and Turing prizes award-winner Geoffrey Hinton, who is often called the godfather of AI.\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode along with its brief. \u201cIt received numerous tax and other benefits from its non-profit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHinton recently told the BBC he believes there is a \u201c10 percent to 20 percent\u201d chance that AI will lead to human extinction within the next 30 years. Previously, Hinton\u2019s been more modest, putting the odds at just 10 percent.\n\nOpenAI is currently structured as a for-profit company controlled by a non-profit board, which places some restrictions on its mission and ability to raise money and compensate investors. The company formally announced its intention to restructure itself as a more traditional for-profit corporation last week, although the change had been anticipated for some time and Musk, who was a cofounder of OpenAI, filed his federal lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to stop it in November.\n\nEncode argues that OpenAI\u2019s planned shift from a nonprofit to a Delaware public benefit corporation would \u201cundermine specific safety-focused commitments the nonprofit has made to the public.\u201d In particular, the brief questions whether a for-profit corporation could ever fulfill OpenAI\u2019s promise that it will \u201cstop competing with and start assisting\u201d any value-aligned organization that appears close to building artificial general intelligence before it does.\n\n\u201cToday, a handful of companies are racing to develop and deploy transformative AI, internalizing the profits but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,\u201d Sneha Revanur, the president and founder of Encode, said in a statement. \u201cThe courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.\u201d\n\nFor its part, OpenAI has urged the court to reject Musk\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that he lacks standing and is seeking to gain an unfair competitive advantage for his own AI startup, xAI. OpenAI also released a trove of emails and other messages from Musk, including several that the company said showed Musk advocated for converting the organization to a for-profit as early as 2017."

            "article_content": "VIRAL trends on TikTok produce a shedload of secretive slang, which can seem impossible to understand unless you're a regular on the platform.\n\nHere we take a look at the latest phrase taking the internet by storm \u2014 the \"Dior Bags\" phenomenon, which was coined by The Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel.\n\n3 Bethenny Frankel is behind the 'Dior Bags' TikTok trend Credit: TikTok\n\nWhat does Dior Bags mean on TikTok?\n\n\"Dior bags\" on TikTok is a code phrase used to discuss drones without triggering content moderation algorithms.\n\nIt was initiated by prominent TikToker Bethenny Frankel, who began using the term to continue conversations about recent drone sightings in states including New Jersey.\n\nShe shared information about UFO-like drones spotted over various locations throughout December 2024.\n\nHowever, the reality star noticed that her videos on this topic were receiving significantly fewer views than she expected.\n\nIn one clip Bethenny said she got \"only 500 views\" one some of her drone-related content, which made her suspicious.\n\nIt led her to believe that TikTok's algorithms could be limiting the visibility of content related to drones.\n\nTo get around this perceived censorship, which is also known as shadow-banning, Bethenny cleverly substituted the word \"drones\" with \"Dior bags\" in her content.\n\nThis code has allowed her and her following to continue discussing the controversial topic without risking video takedowns or account restrictions.\n\nTypes of Dior Bags\n\nBethenny has developed a specific terminology within this code:\n\n\"Worker bees\" : These refer to drones that are easily visible and can be photographed.\n\n: These refer to drones that are easily visible and can be photographed. \"Queen bees\": These are more advanced drones that are harder to spot, described as \"shiny\" and \"more special\".\n\nShe has also mentioned \"alien bags\", hinting at the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement or more advanced technologies.\n\nIn one of her TikToks, Bethenny explains that there \"are the bags that have been released, but there are bags that are decades more advanced that we haven\u2019t even seen\".\n\n3 Different types of 'Dior Bags include 'worker bees' and queen bees'\n\nSpread of the Trend\n\nThe Dior bags trend quickly gained traction on TikTok.\n\nWithin a short period, over 19,000 videos were uploaded using the hashtag #Diorbags.\n\nCommenters on drone-related content have also adopted the term, leaving those of us unfamiliar with the code confused about the seemingly sudden surge in discussions about luxury handbags.\n\nCensorship debate\n\nBethenny's use of this code phrase reflects a broader concern about potential censorship of discussions related to drone sightings.\n\nShe has expressed frustration at not being able to talk openly about the topic, stating: \"It's become clear... people do not want me discussing the Dior bags.\"\n\nThe trend has also sparked discussions about the nature of these drone sightings.\n\n3 'Dior Bags' is a codeword for drones Credit: Alamy\n\nBethenny claims to have cross-referenced information with people who have worked in known organizations and others who are aware of undisclosed operations.\n\nShe emphasizes the complexity of the situation, stating: \"There are many things going on at once, at the same time.\"\n\nKeeping discussion alive\n\nThe \"Dior bags\" trend is part of a larger phenomenon on TikTok where users create and adopt unique terminologies to discuss sensitive or controversial topics.\n\nKnown as \"Algospeak\", it allows users to navigate perceived content moderation systems and continue conversations that they believe might otherwise be suppressed.\n\nThe Dior bags trend has successfully kept the conversation about drones alive on TikTok.\n\nTikTok trends HERE are some more TikTok trends happening right now: Check out the Just Give Me My Money viral trend where each of a group of friends seeks a round of applause for saying the funny phrase. The October 1st viral trend has taken off and it has made the Halloween month the time to fall in love. Try out the Melissa McCarthy I Want Something dance trend. Ever wondered what Hopecore on TikTok was? Here's how to try out the AI hugging trend that's taken the social media by storm.

If you want to change your hair, the calico hair look trend is perfect for you. Another trend can either be an artsy activity or a date night disaster.\n\nIt has also highlighted the creative ways in which social media users adapt to perceived restrictions on free speech and information sharing.\n\nWhile TikTok has released statements about banning hate speech, there is no suggestion the platform is restricting views on content featuring drones.\n\nIn 2020, TikTok said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud that we have already taken steps to keep our community safe, for example, by not permitting content that denies the Holocaust and other violent tragedies.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s always more we can do, which is why we are taking further action to remove misinformation and hurtful stereotypes about Jewish, Muslim and other communities.\n\n\u201cThis includes misinformation about notable Jewish individuals and families who are used as proxies to spread antisemitism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also removing content that is hurtful to the LGBTQ+ community by removing hateful ideas, including content that promotes conversion therapy and the idea that no one is born LGBTQ+.\u201d"

            "article_content": "You have to buy me one fat frog every time you text your ex next year\n\n6 seconds ago\n\nIs a new year, new you right around the corner as we all pop to the shops to buy our green grapes and red underwear in preparation for the big night? Even if you haven\u2019t fallen victim to the TikTok trends going into 2025, no doubt you\u2019ve promised yourself that you\u2019ll sign up for the uni gym and stop forgetting your cash on a Monday night at The Raz.\n\nAll students in Liverpool have their vices \u2013 the Elf Bars can only get you through a few days of seasonal depression and withdrawals from your mum\u2019s Christmas dinner before you\u2019re up at 3am making a vision board and completely reinventing yourself. So whether you\u2019re looking to give up fat frogs, find the love of your life skating by the Pier Head, or just want to attend more than two lectures a week, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nHopefully these resolutions for 2025 will fill you with hope and ambition rather than the all-consuming feeling of guilt and paranoia we\u2019ve all experienced at some point. No doubt you won\u2019t follow any of them and still end up being that one third year who\u2019s blackout drunk at AU night. Happy New Year!\n\nStop trying to find your lost parcel on the Smithdown Matters Facebook page\n\nLet\u2019s face it, a middle aged scouser is probably trying on your Oh Polly parcel as we speak. You can only pray that you\u2019ve not lost the envelope that has your missing ID in it, or any birthday money from your grandparents. There\u2019s only so many times you can ask for the neighbours\u2019 names from the house opposite you, and sometimes you just have to come to terms with the fact that yor Vinted parcel has become part of a student house\u2019s secret santa for the year.\n\nCut down the amount of cash you bring out on a Monday at The Raz\n\nRealistically speaking, telling a medical professional that you consumed 34 raz-bombs the night before a 9am lecture should genuinely be a criminal offence. Adding in the fact that that only cost you \u00a337 in total with entry, they\u2019ll probably give you a pat on the back, but your housemates certainly won\u2019t be celebrating your achievements when you\u2019re throwing up against a lamppost whilst simultaneously crying at the transaction notifications from your bank. Getting a grip is a commendable feat, we promise.\n\nStart wearing multiple layers to the Grove Wing of the Sydney Jones\n\nAlternatively, start protesting against the energy saving in all the libraries and make them turn the heating on. Why is it so cold and why do I never learn to pack a jumper?\n\nStop regretting which modules you picked last year (and complaining about it)\n\nIt\u2019s literally your fault that you picked that one really niche module about Northern Irish art history or coding obscure maths data in Spanish, sorry. Maybe your goal for 2025 is to fulfil the academic weapon role you thought you\u2019d adopt after your first year at uni.\n\nStop getting blackout drunk at pres\u2026\n\nI wish I took a mental note of my alcohol tolerance every time I got caught throwing up outside The Lime Kiln but you win some, you lose some I suppose. Sometimes necking an entire bottle of cheap wine from Wag 1 Offy isn\u2019t the move, and you definitely don\u2019t need that concoction of leftover gin, out of date fruit juice and off brand lemonade to take with you as \u201cjourney juice\u201d. Maybe Dry January would be a good idea for you x\n\nBut start ACTUALLY going to pres\n\nNo doubt you\u2019re getting paralytic before every night out because you\u2019re only doing one every three months \u2013 stop saying no to social plans just because you\u2019ve got assignments to do or CVs to write. The time will make itself for your uni work, but never stops when it comes to piling in an Uber at 3am with no plans, just a few weird props you acquired from the living room floor. It\u2019s all well and good entering your intelligent era next year, but you deserve to let your hair down too. You\u2019ll regret it otherwise, trust me.\n\nStart washing up everything in the sink of your uni kitchen\n\nSink does not equal dumping ground for crusty pasta bowls.\n\nStop making friends with the bossmen on Leece Street\n\nAs hilarious as it was to be a fresher behind the counter in Hot n Tender, there\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than seeing videos of drunk you taking orders from a confused bunch of third years just popping in for a kebab. Save yourself the shame of initiating a love story with the chicken shop man.\n\nStop adding to the bin mountain\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nStart walking from Smithdown to uni even when your mates don\u2019t go\n\nThe feeling of betrayal you experience when you wake up in time for a 10am, get yourself ready with the expectation that all of your coursemates are meeting you on the way to walk to campus, and then seeing that they haven\u2019t been active for 14 hours, is incomparable to anything else. The brand new 2025 you should be brave enough to trek from Smithdown to South Campus Teaching Hub solo, even on a chilly morning. Use it as your hot girl walk and opportunity to listen to a weirdly niche podcast, or stomp along to your \u201cmisty mountain solo self reflection main character moment jams\u201d daylist on Spotify.\n\nStart giving yourself a break from uni assignments\n\nAlong the same lines of actually having a night off to head out on the town with your flatmates, having a relaxing evening tucked up on the sofa with a friend or two can do you wonders mid-semester. There\u2019s only so many late night study sessions you can pull off before you\u2019re burnt out and start to convince yourself that your housemates have forgotten that you exist and you\u2019ll never find a graduate job with an arts degree. So not true! Have a break, have a self care night, have a cheeky takeaway. You deserve it.\n\nStop spending half your student loan on sweet treats\n\nHowever, when you do manage to get that 4000 word assignment started, spending \u00a33 on a pastry after every 150 words is actually quite bad for your bank account \u2013 or so I\u2019ve heard.\n\nStart saying no to Concert Square for a night out\n\nWe\u2019ve all got that one friend that wants to start the night in SOHO or MODO for the \u201cvibes\u201d but you always end up feeling sober, freezing cold and no longer excited to go out. There are so many venues and clubs in Liverpool to test out once or twice, so make a list with your friends of your ideal places to visit and branch out a little! The nightlife scene in town defo stretches further than Concert Square and Quick Burger, you just have to look for it.\n\nStop texting your ex\n\nTHEY ARE NOT THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.\n\nIf they\u2019re an avid Skint goer, on any of the snowsports society boards at John Moores, or genuinely disagree that pineapple doesn\u2019t belong on pizza, then they\u2019re not for you I\u2019m afraid. Get those grapes down you on New Years babe.\n\nStop avoiding walking up Brownlow Hill\n\nWhat happened to those 75 hard plans you made, eh? Taking the long way through campus to avoid clambering up Brownlow Hill is not part of the hot girl gym aesthetic you put on your vision board for 2025. Get those legs moving and squint through your tears, it\u2019s not that bad. Joking. LOL.\n\nStart making time to visit your friends or invite them to visit you\n\nA little bit of home never does anyone any harm. Dragging your home friends up to Liverpool to give them a tour around the Docks and Baltic Market will help you take your mind off things when you\u2019re fighting those winter blues. Sometimes you just need that comfort of getting wine drunk with your best friends in a different city \u2013 making time for this in the new year can do wonders for you.\n\nStop being scared of the teenagers on Lawrence Road\n\nSeriously though, why are they so scary?\n\nStart making moves on your library crush\n\nOur Library Crush feature on Instagram hears, sees and knows everything you\u2019d be dying to know about everyone\u2019s love lives on campus, believe me. There\u2019s nothing more exhilarating than noticing the love of your uni life sitting across from you in the Hogwarts room in the Harold Cohen, or brushing past them on the stairs in the Sydney Jones. I expect to see you all flirting in the Starbucks in time for Valentine\u2019s Day this year.\n\nStop putting the attendance code in for seminars after 11am\n\nIf it\u2019s past 11am just get a grip and go onto campus, surely? The only exception MIGHT be the Thursday after AU night, but you\u2019re admitting your weaknesses if you\u2019re asking the course group chat for the attendance code for the 2pm seminar.\n\nStop being afraid to do things solo\n\nLiverpool is an incredible city with so many activities and places to visit \u2013 if none of them take the fancy of your friends or housemates, don\u2019t be afraid to go and explore things on your own! Incorporating solo dates into your resolutions for 2025 is so cute and VERY mindful.\n\nStart applying to jobs to fuel your Gourmet Grill/Nabzy\u2019s/Harper\u2019s addiction\n\nThere\u2019s only so far a trust fund will stretch when it comes to cheesy chips and gyros unfortunately.\n\nTake our advice and run with it \u2013 we know you won\u2019t stick to any of these resolutions and can\u2019t wait to hear how miserable we all feel by the Easter break. If you manage to find a way to romanticise January and the dreaded exam season, please let us know."

partly through techniques within the classroom; and partly through the narratives attached to the sciences.\n\n'Specifically, the curriculum should offer children a chance to learn about historic Western and non-Western contributions to the sciences, as well as cutting-edge contemporary research from diverse teams of scientists.\n\n'Teachers should be encouraged to frame historic examples of scientific discoveries in the context that some individuals, groups, cultures and nations were disadvantaged in their ability to participate in or to resource research and less able to claim credit and ownership for ideas that had been developed by them.'\n\nThe Royal Society of Biology also said it had sought expertise on 'decolonising the curriculum' and for a 'no more heroes' approach to teaching science in schools.\n\nThis would mean 'avoiding prescriptive lists of historic figures in biology' and instead 'exploring opportunities for local, recogniseable, diverse historic and contemporary figures through which discovery and exploration of biological concepts can be explored'.\n\nIt added that students should be encouraged to 'see a wide range of biologists in action'.\n\nThe Institute for Physics suggested that 'ideas should be framed in the context of the times in which discoveries were made and accredited within Western science'.\n\nIts submission to the curriculum review added: 'They can explain how many of those discoveries drew on earlier work in other parts of the world.\n\n'And how, during the period of growth of Western science, different groups, cultures and nations were more or less able to participate in research, resource scientific activity, or claim credit and ownership for ideas.'\n\nThe Royal Statistical Society called for the greater use of 'real-world data' - such as on gender inequalities or migration - in the teaching of maths and statistics.\n\n'The curriculum should be focused on solving problems using data rather than answering questions about data,' its submission added.\n\nTeaching unions are also among groups to have submitted evidence to the curriculum review.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders said the current curriculum 'prioritises a somewhat monocultural worldview, especially with regards to literature and history'.\n\nMs Phillipson has hailed the review as an 'important step in this Government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity, deliver better life chances and enable more young people to get on'.\n\nThe review is being chaired by Professor Becky Francis, who has spearheaded research into educational inequalities.\n\nTory MP Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said: 'Labour's curriculum changes will drive down educational standards.\n\n'Instead of continuing with a rich, knowledge-based curriculum which has led to our children being the best readers and mathematicians in the Western world, they are tearing it all up.\n\n'Pure education vandalism once again.'\n\nReform UK deputy leader Richard Tice hit out at 'a ludicrous proposal from the wokerati'.\n\nHe added: 'We need more historic British heroes and achievements to be taught to our children, not less.'"

            "article_content": "Andrew Ng's assertion that artificial intelligence is the new electricity captures the impact and potential of AI across various sectors. However, many individuals may shy away from merging coding and AI due to the belief that advanced coding skills are mandatory. Bursting this myth reveals a world of opportunities for those without a programming background.\n\nLet\u2019s break down how anyone can get started with coding and AI, even without writing a single line of code.\n\nThe Myth of Coding and AI\n\nThe belief that AI is a domain exclusive to programmers is as outdated as dial-up internet.\n\nRecent developments tell a different story.\n\nThe \u201cFuture of Work Report: AI at Work\u201d highlights that over 55% of LinkedIn members globally are expected to see their jobs change due to the rise of generative AI.\n\nAI projects now require collaboration between strategists, domain experts, and communicators, creating a balanced blend of skills. Artificial Intelligence demands professionals who understand how to apply its power, interpret data, and design systems that address business needs.\n\nCompanies are now looking for professionals who can translate AI\u2019s technical potential into practical strategies that deliver results. The World Economic Forum confirms this trend and predicts that 97 million new jobs will emerge globally in the AI sector by 2025. Interestingly, many of these jobs will not require coding expertise. This shift shows that AI is no longer limited to programmers but is open to people with diverse skills and expertise.\n\nNon-Coding Roles in AI\n\nAI is no longer a siloed space for software developers. Numerous non-coding roles exist within the AI ecosystem. Each position plays a vital role in the successful implementation and governance of AI technologies.\n\nLet's go over some of the few non-technical roles below:\n\nAI Product Manager\n\nAI product managers connect the development team and business stakeholders. Their main role is to ensure that AI projects align with business objectives and customer needs.

            "article_content": "BENGALURU: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and University College London have developed a machine learning method to predict material properties using limited data. They believe this can aid in the discovery of materials with desired properties, such as semiconductors.\u201cIn recent years, materials engineers have turned to machine learning models to predict which types of materials can possess specific properties such as electronic band gaps, formation energies, and mechanical properties, in order to design new materials,\u201d IISc said.It added that, however, data on material properties \u2013 which is needed to train these models \u2013 is limited because testing materials is expensive and time-consuming. This prompted researchers led by Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, IISc, to work on addressing this challenge.In a new study, they found an efficient way to use a machine learning approach called transfer learning to predict the values of specific material properties.In transfer learning, a large model is first pre-trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned to adapt to a smaller target dataset. \u201cIn this method, the model first learns to do a simple task like classifying images into, say, cats and non-cats, and is then trained for a specific task, like classifying images of tissues into those containing tumours and those not containing tumours for cancer diagnosis,\u201d Gopalakrishnan said.Their transfer learning-based model demonstrated superior performance compared to models trained from scratch, Reshma Devi, the study's lead author, said. The team\u2019s Multi-property Pre-Training (MPT) framework achieved remarkable results by simultaneously training on seven different bulk 3D material properties. Most notably, the model successfully predicted band gap values for 2D materials it never encountered during training.Looking ahead, the technology shows promise for battery development by predicting ion movement within electrodes. \u201cThis research could contribute significantly to India\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing initiatives by helping predict material defects,\u201d Gopalakrishnan said."

            "article_content": "If you\u2019ve ever had a doctor order a blood test for you, chances are that they ran a complete blood count, or CBC. One of the most common blood tests in the world, CBC tests are run billions of times each year to diagnose conditions and monitor patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut despite the test\u2019s ubiquity, the way clinicians interpret and use it in the clinic is often less precise than ideal. Currently, blood test readings are based on one-size-fits-all reference intervals that don\u2019t account for individual differences.\n\nI am a mathematician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and my team studies ways to use computational tools to improve clinical blood testing. To develop better ways to capture individual patient definitions of \u201cnormal\u201d lab values, my colleagues and I in the Higgins Lab at Harvard Medical School examined 20 years of blood count tests from tens of thousands of patients from both the East and West coasts.\n\nIn our newly published research, we used machine learning to identify healthy blood count ranges for individual patients and predict their risk of future disease.\n\nClinical tests and complete blood counts\n\nMany people commonly think of clinical tests as purely diagnostic. For example, a COVID-19 or a pregnancy test comes back as either positive or negative, telling you whether you have a particular condition. However, most tests don\u2019t work this way. Instead, they measure a biological trait that your body continuously regulates up and down to stay within certain bounds.\n\nYour complete blood count is also a continuum. The CBC test creates a detailed profile of your blood cells \u2013 such as how many red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells are in your blood. These markers are used every day in nearly all areas of medicine.\n\nFor example, hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that allows your red blood cells to carry oxygen. If your hemoglobin levels are low, it might mean you are iron deficient.\n\nPlatelets are cells that help form blood clots and stop bleeding. If your platelet count is low, it may mean you have some internal bleeding and your body is using platelets to help form blood clots to plug the wound.\n\nWhite blood cells are part of your immune system. If your white cell count is high, it might mean you have an infection and your body is producing more of these cells to fight it off.\n\nNormal ranges and reference intervals\n\nBut this all raises the question: What actually counts as too high or too low on a blood test?\n\nTraditionally, clinicians determine what are called reference intervals by measuring a blood test in a range of healthy people. They usually take the middle 95% of these healthy values and call that \u201cnormal,\u201d with anything above or below being too low or high. These normal ranges are used nearly everywhere in medicine.\n\nBut reference intervals face a big challenge: What\u2019s normal for you may not be normal for someone else.\n\nNearly all blood count markers are heritable, meaning your genetics and environment determine much of what the healthy value for each marker would be for you.\n\nAt the population level, for example, a normal platelet count is approximately between 150 and 400 billion cells per liter of blood. But your body may want to maintain a platelet count of 200 \u2013 a value called your set point. This means your normal range might only be 150 to 250.\n\nDifferences between a patient\u2019s true normal range and the population-based reference interval can create problems for doctors. They may be less likely to diagnose a disease if your set point is far from a cutoff. Conversely, they may run unnecessary tests if your set point is too close to a cutoff.\n\nDefining what\u2019s normal for you\n\nLuckily, many patients get blood counts each year as part of routine checkups. Using machine learning models, my team and I were able to estimate blood count set points for over 50,000 patients based on their history of visits to the clinic. This allowed us to study how the body regulates these set points and to test whether we can build better ways of personalizing lab test readings.\n\nOver multiple decades, we found that individual normal ranges were about three times smaller than at the population level. For example, while the \u201cnormal\u201d range for the white blood cell count is around 4.0 to 11.0 billion cells per liter of blood, we found that most people\u2019s individual ranges were much narrower, more like 4.5 to 7, or 7.5 to 10. When we used these set points to interpret new test results, they helped improve diagnosis of diseases such as iron deficiency, chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism. We could note when someone\u2019s result was outside their smaller personal range, potentially indicating an issue, even if the result was within the normal range for the population overall.\n\nThe set points themselves were strong indicators for future risk of developing a disease. For example, patients with high white blood cell set points were more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in the future. They were also nearly twice as likely to die of any cause compared with similar patients with low white cell counts. Other blood count markers were also strong predictors of future disease and mortality risk.\n\nIn the future, doctors could potentially use set points to improve disease screening and how they interpret new test results. This is an exciting avenue for personalized medicine: to use your own medical history to define what exactly healthy means for you.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Hurricanes Milton and Helene brought a bill of $50 billion, while other losses were incurred because of a \"high frequency\" of severe thunderstorms. In total, the U.S. saw two-thirds of the planet's total insured losses.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen looking at the wider picture, there was a 6% increase in global economic losses from natural disasters in 2024 when compared to the previous year, and it was the fifth consecutive year of insured losses topping $100 billion.\n\nIn Europe, intense flooding was estimated to have caused $10 billion in insured losses, while this weather phenomenon also brought financial losses in the Gulf region.\n\nWhy is Swiss Re's report concerning?\n\nIn early December, the Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, coming after the previous record set in 2023.\n\nThat's an alarming pattern, and according to Swiss Re, if we don't get a handle on rising global temperatures \u2014 which exacerbate extreme weather events \u2014 it's anticipated that \"losses are likely to increase.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Adaptation is therefore key, and protective measures, such as dykes, dams and flood gates, are up to 10 times more cost-effective than rebuilding,\" the company said in a statement, according to Fox 28.\n\nWhat can be done to protect against losses from extreme weather?\n\nPrevention from the potential damage caused by extreme weather is indeed becoming more crucial as multiple insurers have either pulled coverage for losses incurred following hurricanes and flooding or else are severely increasing the cost of premiums.\n\nWhat would you do if natural disasters were threatening your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThat's why Savannah Trims president Gene Kennedy, whose company makes flood protection barriers, emphasized to The Cool Down that businesses and homeowners should investigate what kind of products are available to protect properties from the damage and financial losses caused by extreme weather events.\n\nBut these figures also demonstrate the importance of reducing the rate of rising global temperatures by curbing our production of planet-warming pollution.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the ways to do so are swapping gas-guzzling cars for electric versions, eating more plant-based foods, and investing in renewable energy technology.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Save this picture! Today, data is primarily stored in large data centres across the globe, which are major energy guzzlers with significant environmental impact. Image \u00a9 Claudio Schwarz via Unsplash\n\nThis article is the winning entry of the Epistle Writing Prize 2024, an annual competition dedicated to recognizing outstanding writing on design, architecture, and the environment.\n\nWe might be in the age of the digital cloud - however celestial or ethereal it may appear to be - but it is not only incontrovertibly material but also a powerful ecological force. In present times, data centers are mammoth powerhouses of modern information, communication, and technology industries with giant servers that store and process data. While their proliferation is in a sense, a consequence of our consumption patterns, and as the global demand for the digital grows, so does the data center footprint.\n\nAs nations worldwide race to achieve data sovereignty, environmentalists and climate activists lament the destruction of land by the sheer magnitude of desolation that the data center engenders. What is evident is that these centers, as much as they stand tall as factory-like libraries, are integral laboratories for exploring what a sustainable digital future could take shape as. However, the question remains: can such a future truly be realized?\n\nToday, there are a reported 5,375 data centers in the United States, while Germany and the United Kingdom follow suit with 522 and 517 respectively. The rapid expansion of India's data center industry, driven by initiatives such as the broadband policy and the introduction of JIO and Unified Payment Interface (UPI), coupled with a user base exceeding 600 million smartphone users consuming an average of 26 GB per month, forecasts significant growth. India's 152 data centers are concentrated in the cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. Estimates indicate that the market could reach $5 billion, with installed data center capacity projected to escalate from 800 MW in 2022 to 1700 MW by 2025. Acknowledging this surge, the Government of India unveiled a preliminary National Draft Data Center Policy in 2020. Various states have also implemented or planned data center policies, forging partnerships with private entities for facility development. Yet, these policies overlook a critical concern; their environmental impact.\n\nAt this juncture, the challenge lies not so much in designing for sustainability but in accommodating the unthinkable scale at which such infrastructure is needed and the repercussions of its abundant byproducts. This begs the question, are corporations hiding behind the mask of going green, marching forward with their data cantonments? What comes after the green building? Let's break it down.\n\nCarbon and the Cloud\n\nHeat is the waste product of computation, necessitating extensive use of power-guzzling air conditioning systems like computer room air conditioners (CRACs) or handlers (CRAHs) to mitigate thermal impact. To make cloud services accessible around the clock, facilities are designed to be hyper-redundant (if one system fails, another is ready to take its place), to prevent a disruption in user experience, further adding to energy consumption. In present times, annual energy usage in data centers reaches 200 terawatt hours (TWh), surpassing that of certain countries, reflecting their substantial environmental footprint.\n\nWhile major \"hyper-scale\" data centers operated by companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon are committed to achieving carbon neutrality through carbon offsetting and investment in renewable energy such as wind and solar power, smaller-scale data centers often lack the financial means and stability to pursue similar sustainability measures and manage fluctuating capacity requirements.\n\nLooking within the subcontinent, the state of affairs is bleak \u2013 with the draft National Data Center Policy encouraging the use of renewable energy but lacking in enforcement when it comes to specifying a mandate or threshold use of green energy.\n\nAn Era of Drought\n\nWater, a better connective agent than air for cooling, has encouraged the move to water instead of air for cooling to cut carbon emissions \u2013 yet it has significant drawbacks. In Bluffdale, Utah, residents face water shortages and power disruptions due to the Utah Data Center, which consumes seven million gallons of water daily. India, home to 17% of the global population, possesses only 4% of the world's freshwater resources. The country is grappling with water scarcity with nearly 21 major hubs including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Chennai dealing with severe water crises. The issue here is two-fold. First, neither the draft National Data Centre Policy nor any of the extant state policies address these water demands. Second, due to the unfathomable magnitude of such water consumption, statistics regarding data center water usage or its impact on the water table and communities have been left out of the picture.\n\nIn response to increasing awareness of glaring impacts on water-stressed communities, companies like Google among others, are pledging to go \"water-positive\" by 2030 \u2013 by optimizing water utilization and minimizing waste through recycling, as well as investing in water infrastructure for a water-secure future. However, the story is the same here; while corporate pledges such as these provide hope for a green future, they are not enforceable, nor do they appear to be feasible given the explosive growth of the cloud.\n\nA Millennia of Decay\n\nThe rapid turnover of computing and electrical components due to continuous technological advancements has resulted in a substantial increase in electronic waste. Cloud servers, with an average lifespan of only three years, require frequent disposal of outdated hardware. These disposal patterns further exacerbate the monumental increase in waste and have a hazardous impact on natural landscapes. Adding to this are security concerns with some companies demanding the destruction of server equipment to prevent the breach of sensitive data and information, negating the possibility of reusing components.\n\nIn vast manufacturing facilities located in the Global South, distinctive of low labor costs and minimal legal protections, smartphones are manufactured and distributed globally. Often discarded after mere months of use, their afterlife is destined to electronic waste sites, rife with toxic metals and radioactive elements that take over millennia to decay.\n\nPower and the Planet\n\nThe ecosystem of computational dynamics today has not entirely been shaped by the limits of design and technology, but rather by the stark inefficiencies of systematic thought and leadership that herald global interactions. As individuals, communities, corporations, and governments, we need to march forward toward creative pursuit through the lens of both efficiency and sufficiency. This requires a shift in our infrastructural configuration. Can we rethink and re-trace our steps to design circular patterns of consumption that tactfully address security concerns? Initiatives in Europe are paving the way for efficiency in equipment design that can prolong the lifespan of servers as well as ease the process of repair and recycling using material passports \u2013 that can document unit histories much like timestamps. Such efforts most definitely help us break immutable boundaries of what the cloud can materialize as and push us to herald in an ecologically sensitive and conscious digital age.\n\n'The Cloud Has Arrived, But What About Its Ecological Footprint?' by Amrita Khosla is the winning entry of the Epistle Writing Prize 2024 in Category 2: Break It Down.

            "article_content": "\u201cWhat I remember is being very quiet, just not talking at all, because that\u2019s what he told me to do,\u201d she said of the train ride.\n\nIn the early 1940s, authorities had consigned her parents to a Jewish ghetto in their hometown , now known as Lviv, but Diskin escaped their fate when she was left in the care of others. The antisemitic persecution continued even after the Soviet Army liberated the city from the Nazis, as they sought to arrest the rabbi who was taking care of her because he rescued Jewish children from orphanages. So they fled in the middle of the night.\n\nVilunya Diskin\u2019s earliest memory is as a 4-year-old, traveling on a train through a country that no longer exists, being implored to stay quiet as she and others fled the genocidal violence convulsing much of Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVilunya Diskin sat in her home in Jamaica Plain. She recently discovered through genealogy testing and records in Europe and Israel who her birth parents and twin sister were. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\n\nDiskin\u2019s flight would eventually bring her to the United States, where she was adopted by a Jewish family and raised in California before settling in Boston as a young adult. She would become a feminist icon when she co-authored the seminal text \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d in 1970.\n\nBut she never saw her parents again, nor did she know what had become of her twin sister. The answers would be lost to the cataclysm of the war until, eight decades later, she finally found out who she really is.\n\nMemory can be a tricky thing. In Diskin\u2019s earliest recollection, she is the ward of a rabbi, Israel Leiter, and his family, and believes they had fled Poland and were traveling through what was then-Czechoslovakia. Before Leiter, Diskin had been hidden away for years by a Catholic woman who was a childhood friend of her father. Her twin sister wasn\u2019t so lucky. Unbeknownst to Diskin, her sibling was dead.\n\nYears later, as a college student at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1960s, she would flip through Polish-language magazines, searching for photos of her sister, though she could no longer understand the words. She eventually made requests to archivists in Israel who specialize in information about those killed in the Holocaust. There were obstacles, missing or incorrect bits of information, which complicated her search. She had the wrong year and wrong location of her birth. She had her parents\u2019 last name, but not their first names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVilunya Diskin with Ester Leiter. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\n\nA longtime resident of Jamaica Plain and now 83, Diskin finally has some answers. Her parents were named Salomon and Edzia, and she knows the identities of her grandparents and great-grandparents, what some of them did for work, and when some were born, married, and died.\n\nAnd thanks to the work of the Holocaust Reunion Project, she now knows her birth name: Wilhelmina Fliegelman.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s like a rebirth,\u201d she said recently in between sips of tea at a cafe in her Boston neighborhood. \u201cHere I am in my 80s and it\u2019s a whole new chapter.\u201d\n\nSpecialists in Ashkenazi Jewish genealogy, Jennifer Mendelsohn and Adina Newman, pieced together Diskin\u2019s past. In this case, they used a DNA match list that included distant familial connections to Diskin to reverse-engineer her family tree, using available records and databases from Europe and Israel to fill in the gaps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with meaning,\u201d Newman said during a recent interview.\n\nFor both her and Mendelsohn, the discovery of family roots and relatives can be rewarding, but also bittersweet.\n\n\u201cThese are always happy reunion stories but they\u2019re built on a foundation of very, very, very, awful, painful trauma,\u201d Mendelsohn said.\n\nVilunya Diskin with Rabbi Israel Leiter. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\n\nDiskin\u2019s parents, she has discovered, worked in a bakery run by her grandfather. She has the address of the bakery, as well as the address of her first home in Lviv, which is now in present-day Ukraine. She hopes to visit after the latest war in that part of the world \u2014 a conflict that has pitted Ukraine against Russia \u2014 is over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is profound,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is profound to fill those holes.\u201d\n\nHer twin sister\u2019s name was Amalia. The Catholic woman who took her in when her parents were taken away was Anna Demenczuk, and Diskin lived with her for three years. When her father, Salomon, failed to return after Lviv was liberated, Demenczuk honored his wishes that Diskin be raised by a Jewish family, giving her over to Leiter, a local rabbi. After fleeing through Europe, Leiter and his family eventually emigrated to New York, taking Diskin with them. In the United States, she was adopted by a Jewish American couple at the age of 7 and grew up in California.\n\nIn her youth, she was drawn to the Civil Rights Movement because, she said, of her background surviving the Holocaust. She saw parallels between the treatment of Black Americans and the historic oppression of Jews.\n\nShe has lived in Greater Boston since the mid-1960s. In her 20s, she was a member of a local 13-member collective that wrote \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves,\u201d an influential text that has been celebrated as the bible of women\u2019s health, updated multiple times over the decades to introduce generations of girls to their own anatomy. That advocacy was born out of frustration with how little doctors knew about how women\u2019s bodies worked and how they failed to listen to female patients.\n\nOur Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era Handout\n\nDiskin cuts an energetic presence, willing to discuss modern-day politics or history with a smiling frankness. Nowadays, she worries the United States is \u201cgalloping backward into the 19th century\u201d regarding women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cThe women\u2019s movement has always said that knowledge is power,\u201d said Diskin, who has two children and three grandchildren. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, learning her own history has made her feel even more powerful, she said. When she received a trove of information in September that revealed so much about her family and her past, Diskin said she did not cry but did feel so overwhelmed that she took a long nap.\n\nLemberg Ghetto, USSR, World War II, 1941-1944. Lemberg, formerly part of Poland, was captured by the Soviet Union in 1939. A ghetto was created in 1941 by Nazi Germany, which held the city during much of World War II. The Jewish population of the city was almost completely exterminated, with thousands sent to Belzec concentration camp. Renamed Lviv, the city, also known as Lwow or Lvov, is now in Ukraine. Heritage Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis information is so big,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so gigantic.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there are remaining mysteries she may never unravel. She knows when and where her mother died; she was not sent to a concentration camp but to a ghetto established specifically for Jews in Lviv, Diskin said. Her mother died the same year she was born. But she does not know what became of her father. She assumes he was killed in the Holocaust; otherwise, he would have returned for her. He would have known where to look, she said. And while she knows that her twin sister died at only three months of age, she does not know the circumstances of her death.\n\nStill, she is buoyed and heartened by the new revelations. She now has photos of her biological parents, whose faces she previously could not conjure up. She has cousins she never knew about in Israel and Australia. She has corresponded with the son of Demenczuk, the woman who took her in. She considers him a long-lost brother. And she is pushing for Demenczuk\u2019s name to be added to a memorial in Israel honoring those who risked their safety to save Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nThe only heaviness she felt in finally receiving the news of her birth parents was that she could not share it with her husband, Martin, who died in 1997. She is a self-described optimist, someone who wakes up happy, and she credits researchers like Mendelsohn and Newman, as well as \u201cthe miracle\u201d of DNA testing, that allowed \u201cimportant facts\u201d to be realized. The Nazis, she said, tried to erase Jews from history, and this kind of research is a form of justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s righteous work,\u201d Diskin said, \u201cand it\u2019s important work.\u201d\n\nFlowers, candles, and a flag of Israel at the memorial to the victims of Lviv ghetto during the commemoration ceremony of the 80th anniversary of the liquidation of the Lviv ghetto and Janowska concentration camp on Nov. 12, 2023, in Lviv, Ukraine. More than 136,000 Jews were resettled to the Lviv ghetto, the third-largest ghetto in Eastern Europe.

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

            "article_content": "'What the f**k is that?' a young jackaroo on a remote cattle station asks the other three blokes riding rough in the tray of a HiLux ute.\n\n'Lindsay\u2026. that's a Min Min light! And if it catches up to us, we'll all disappear into the sky,' a rugged Indigenous stockman named William replied in terror.\n\nBaffled and confused, Lindsay turned and asked: 'What the hell is a Min Min light?'\n\nSince the dawn of man, every ancient civilisation has detailed strange sights in the sky.\n\nAncient Egyptians carved hieroglyphs of 'sky gods' into their monuments, the Romans reported seeing 'gleaming' lights above their cities at night, while Hindu mythology and the Bible mention glowing 'chariots' hovering among the clouds.\n\nAustralia also has its own version of UFOs - or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) as they've now come to be known after a rebrand by NASA.\n\nAnd the first recorded encounters with 'conscious' glowing orbs unfolded in the 1870s, in the remote Queensland mining outpost of Min Min.\n\nSince then, it has become a hub for the strange phenomenon, with hundreds of documented sightings leading it to be dubbed Australia's Area 51.\n\nBoulia, population 230, is ground zero for the eerie phenomenon dubbed Min Min lights\n\nFootage shows an object purported to be a Min Min light spotted east of Boulia in November 2021 at about 10pm\n\nIn the year 2000, a Min Min light tourism centre even opened up there, welcoming thousands of visitors from across the world each year.\n\nResting on a lonely stretch of road between Boulia and Winton, in the central west of the Sunshine State, the tiny community sprang to life as the first commercial copper mines in the region were established in the 1860s.\n\n'The first recorded sightings were in 1879 at the Min Min pub,' Karen Savage, a tourism officer at the Min Min Encounter centre in Boulia, tells me.\n\n'But local Indigenous people say sightings go back as long as there have been people here.'\n\nThere are many differing beliefs surrounding Min Min lights, depending on what part of the country they appear.\n\nSome say the lights are there to guide lost travellers back home, while others fear the orbs lead wandering souls to their doom.\n\nMany also claim the lights appear out of nowhere, just to play tricks on them.\n\n'We don't know why this area has become a hub. But we do know that the prevalence of sightings here are far higher than the rest of Australia,' Ms Savage says.\n\nMin Min has become a hub for the strange phenomenon, with hundreds of documented sightings leading it to be dubbed Australia's Area 51\n\n'They can appear, disappear and reappear. It can be just one light or it can be multiple lights and while most of the sightings are white, there are also recorded sightings in various different colours - like green, blue, purple, yellow.\n\n'Local Indigenous people in the Boulia area mainly see them as a light that would guide them home.\n\n'In other areas, they see the lights as ancestral spirits in unrest - and dangerous.'\n\nThat's certainly the case for local Aboriginal people in the Barkly Tablelands region of the Northern Territory, where one of the country's largest cattle stations, Alroy Downs, is located.\n\nLindsay Pyne travelled to the area to work as a jackaroo in the mid 1990s, when he was just 17.\n\nFor many rough and ready country kids who had just left high school, it was a rite of passage to head to the Outback and muster cattle before settling on a trade.\n\nNowadays, the uniquely Australian custom has largely given way to gap-year Contiki tours overseas.\n\nKeen for adventure and unafraid of hard work, Lindsay fit in perfectly with the no-nonsense crew of stockmen.\n\nAmong them was an Aboriginal elder in a cowboy hat named William - who wore black stubbies and a blue singlet every day, with tattered R. M. Williams boots and no socks.\n\n'The bloke who owned the farm said he couldn't run the joint without William because he knew every square inch of the property - and being an elder, he just knew everything there was to know about the bush as well,' Lindsay tells me.\n\n'He took a shine to me and when we'd get sent off in groups of two or three, I'd often go with him and he would often tell me things about the dreamtime.'\n\nLindsay Pyne (pictured recently) once saw a Min Min light when he was working as a young jackeroo\n\nBecause the property was so large, the men would be camping away from the homestead about 50 per cent of the time.\n\nAccording to Lindsay, if they were more than 150km out, they would just set up camp, if it was less than that, they'd ride their horses back to the homestead or pile into a ute.\n\nOn this particular day, they were right on the boundary and it was getting dark.\n\nBut after a gruelling day's work, they decided to head back for a warm shower and comfy bed.\n\n'I was on the back of the ute with him and I looked over to the right and there it was - this weird white light - maybe the size of a soccer ball,' Lindsay recalls.\n\n'I thought it was the spotty of a roo shooter. But you've gotta understand, where it was coming from, there are no tracks. It's tufted grass, so you couldn't even ride a motorbike through there.\n\n'So there is no way someone was hunting out there or in a vehicle.'\n\nLindsay says he wasn't afraid - until he saw the look of horror on William's face.\n\n'He said to me, \"If the light comes we'll all disappear into the sky.\" He was hysterical,' Lindsay recounts.\n\n'Everyone looked up to him so we were more scared of it because of the way he was reacting to it. You gotta understand that this is the toughest guy you'd ever meet.'\n\nWilliam slammed on the roof of the twin cab and told the driver to gun it.\n\nWhile encounters and descriptions of Min Min lights vary considerably, one of the most common observations is that the orbs appear 'intelligent, conscious and curious'.\n\n'It sort of moves with you and always feels like it's getting closer. It started off the size of a soccer ball and then got bigger and bigger,' Lindsay says.\n\n'It kind of seemed like it wanted to follow us or something. It's hard to explain.'\n\nWhile encounters and descriptions of Min Min lights vary considerably, one of the most common observations is that the orbs appear 'intelligent, conscious and curious' (stock photo)\n\nDespite the enduring mystery, there are many possible scientific explanations for what could cause the phenomenon.\n\nOne theory is known as Fata Morgana - which takes its name from the Italian term for the Arthurian sorceress the Morgan Fairy, who was said to lure sailors to their deaths with bewitching lights, like fairy castles in the air.\n\nFata Morgana occurs when a layer of warm air rests over a layer of cooler air, causing light rays, from tens or even hundreds of kilometres away, to bend in a narrow band around the horizon.\n\nWhen these temperature inversions happen, it can often create a mirage or make objects appear distorted.\n\nA famous example of this is when ships can appear as though they are floating above the water.\n\nOthers believe sightings of Min Min lights are merely just lights from camp fires, far-off moving vehicles, aircraft or buildings.\n\nBut no definitive explanation has ever been proven.\n\nThe eerie inside story of Australia's most infamous UFO sighting: Witnesses threatened, a government cover-up and the official report so explosive it was destroyed after the death of its author\n\nBy Steve Jackson for Daily Mail Australia\n\nThere was no sound to begin with, just an eerie shape, looming in from the distance. Some say it looked like a giant silver cigar, others a flying saucer, a metallic disc, shimmering overhead.\n\nAs the craft slowed to a hover above Westall High School, the children in the playground started screaming. One of the eyewitnesses, Mary Eastwood, said it felt like 'the end of the world'. Students were running around, hysterical, or throwing themselves to the ground in panic. Mary and her friend sat on the perimeter fence, dumbstruck.\n\nThe only thing we know for sure almost 60 years later is that something strange and unnerving happened at the school, just south-east of Melbourne, on an April morning in 1966. Official efforts to dismiss the eye-witness reports by insisting the 'craft' was nothing more than a stray weather balloon have never quite succeeded and a secret government report into the incident has never been released.\n\nIndeed, that explosive report - authored by a high-ranking aviation official - is believed to rubbish the official explanation that the mysterious object was a high-altitude balloon.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that many of the people at Westall that day \u2013 students, teachers and residents of nearby Clayton South \u2013 resolutely believe what they saw was an alien spacecraft, a UFO. And now, even more astonishingly, a leading UFO investigator says what they actually encountered might have been a captured alien craft deployed as part of secret U.S. military tests.\n\nAuthor Ross Coulthart has spent decades investigating the Westall incident and is convinced the truth has been deliberately covered up.\n\nThe key to the mystery lies in the secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting of an unidentified craft which is still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the document, it was compiled in 1967 by an engineer - known only as 'Mr X' - who was working as the Assistant Controller of the Aircraft, Guided Weapons and Electronics Supply Division of the government's now-defunct Department of Supply.\n\nLeading UFO investigator Ross Coulthart claims the truth about the Westall incident has been deliberately covered up, with a secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives\n\nA purported photograph of the Westall UFO incident, in which almost 200 students, teachers and residents in south-east Melbourne claimed to have witnessed an unexplained flying object hovering near a suburban school before descending onto a nearby open field in 1966\n\nA newspaper clipping outlining what several witnesses saw on that fateful day in 1966\n\nCoulthart claims only two copies of the 'Westall Papers' were ever made. One was destroyed by Mr X's widow on his orders after his death, while the other remains hidden from public sight.\n\n'One of the things that happened in the wake of the Westall incident was that an official, who was very senior in Australian aviation, was retained by Defence to write an investigation into what took place that day,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'He's since died... but I have spoken with the son of the man who wrote the report.\n\n'He says his father worked on the report in the family home and that he became aware as a child of the fact that his dad was travelling to the Westall school for three or four days in a row in what became an extraordinarily intense investigation.\n\n'And his father was so freaked out by what he discovered \u2013 the implications of what he learned \u2013 that he gave a secret copy of the Westall Papers to his wife and told her to keep it hidden away in a particular location in the family home.\n\n'He made her promise she would destroy it when he died but, essentially, that was his insurance policy.\n\n'Mr X's son doesn't know what was precisely revealed in that document, but he does have a strong recollection of his father's position on the Westall incident, and believes the truth went well beyond the simple spy balloon explanation.\n\n'He watched his mother burn the report in their back garden after his father died but there is another copy that was the filed with the Department of Supply.'\n\nCoulthart, a five-times Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist, says the mystery file was transferred to the Defence archives after the Department of Supply was dissolved in June 1974.\n\nINTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED CRAFT\n\nAndrew Greenwood was a teacher at Westall High School when the unexplained incident occurred \u2013 and says he was later threatened into silence.\n\nHe vividly recalls a 'hysterical' student running into his Year 9 science class during first break, claiming there was a flying saucer in the sky. While dubious at first, Mr Greenwood nonetheless went outside and was shocked to see a bright silver object 'the size of a car' hovering in the air near the school.\n\nHe said the object began to slowly rise into the sky before it was approached by five aircraft. Whenever these aircraft drew close to the silver object, it quickly darted in a different direction before stopping again.\n\nThe cat-and-mouse encounter continued for about 20 minutes before the object landed briefly in a nearby field - known as the Grange Reserve - then shot away and vanished into the sky entirely.\n\nAndrew Greenwood, one of the teachers at Westall High School during the UFO encounter, has described a frightening visit he received from government officials demanding he keep quiet\n\nTerry Peck, who was a student at Westall, shows former 60 Minutes investigative reporter Ross Coulthart a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school in April 1966\n\nWithin 40 minutes, air force and army personnel poured into the area in military vehicles and formed a secure barrier around the reserve. But, knowing the area well, Mr Greenwood and dozens of students were able to sneak in and see what was going on.\n\n'[We saw a] circular area, like trampled grass,' Mr Greenwood says. 'And there were guards around it and there were people in there with equipment.'\n\nMr Greenwood remains convinced the object he witnessed was an alien aircraft.\n\n'I saw a craft. A mechanical object intelligently controlled hovering above me,' he told Coulthart in The Phenomenon, a documentary released in 2022.\n\nHe added that after discussing the incident with local news reporters, Mr Greenwood received an unexpected \u2013 and unwelcome \u2013 late-night visit at his home from two men claiming to be government officials.\n\nAccording to him, one was wearing plain clothes and the other a high-ranking air force uniform. They told him his recollection of the incident was incorrect - and he would be well advised to stop talking about the encounter.\n\n'When I tried to explain to them that they weren't there - I was - and I knew what I saw, well, the first suggestion was, 'You'd be ill-advised to go on saying that because clearly you were drunk on duty and will have to be reported to the education department and of course you will lose your job',' he says.\n\n'Absolutely, I was threatened. I was told that I should not say anything.'\n\nHe believes the intimidating visit was part of a government conspiracy to cover up the country's largest mass UFO encounter.\n\nEYEWITNESSES THREATENED\n\nOne oft-reported explanation for the Westall incident is that the object could have been a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from the HIBAL program at Mildura Airport, about a six-hour drive away in Victoria's north-west.\n\nThe program was established by Australia's Department of Supply in conjunction with the US Atomic Energy Commission in 1960. It purportedly used white and silver high-altitude balloons to sample the levels of radioactive elements injected into the stratosphere by atomic experiments in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSome sceptics have suggested the object spotted hovering over the Westall school in 1966 was a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from Mildura Airport about six hours away\n\nBut Coulthart - who has led investigations across ABC's Four Corners, Nine's 60 Minutes and Seven's Sunday Night flagship news and current affairs programs - is convinced there is a more sinister explanation.\n\n'Andrew's account is extraordinarily credible,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'And he's adamant that what he saw was something anomalous that he couldn't explain away as a balloon or anything like that.\n\n'In fact, he says categorically that it was not a balloon of any kind whatsoever, that it was clearly some kind of craft.\n\n'He says he saw an elliptical, metallic disc-shaped object moving in some intelligent way.\n\n'And he's not the only one. There are well over 180 witnesses who saw the exact same thing - people like Terry Peck, who has a particularly vivid memory of what she saw, and who is equally adamant 'it was not a balloon'.\n\nPeck, a former student at Westall, provided Coulthart with a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school.\n\nRecounting that fateful April day, she claimed she jumped over the school fence and raced towards where the UFO had landed in the pines.\n\nBy the time she arrived, two other classmates were already there. One of them, a girl, was hysterical. Peck alleges the student was carried off in an ambulance and never came back to school.\n\nWhat happened next still troubles her.\n\n'We all got called to an assembly... and they told us all to keep quiet,' she says.\n\n'I know this sounds corny, but I know what I saw. It was not a balloon. It was a machine, a craft.'\n\n'I'd absolutely just like someone to come forward from the services just to say, \"Yes, it did happen, and it landed and there was a cover-up\".'\n\nCoulthart says he has since spoken to multiple people who attended the assembly who all shared the same story.\n\n'They all describe how there were officials from the government and people in uniform who were standing up the back of the hall who were listening to what was being said to the students,' he says.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the students being warned.\n\n'We've spoken to firemen who attended the incident, and numerous people who were told - threatened - that if they talked about this, this was a national security issue, and that they should shut up about it,' Coulthart says.\n\nFive-time Walkley Award-winning journalist Ross Coulthart vows he will continue investigating the 'non-human technology' involved in encounters such as the Westall mass sighting despite ongoing attempts to discredit anyone who speaks out about the 'biggest story in history'\n\n'Moreover, when the recovery operation happened, there were American-accented personnel driving American left-hand-drive jeeps.\n\n'So, it's just absurd to try to patronise these witnesses by saying, 'You don't know what you saw, it was just a spy or weather balloon'. That's bollocks, absolute rubbish.'\n\nPUBLIC LEFT IN DARK\n\nCoulthart has spent years pushing for the Westall Papers to be made public, but fears they may remain locked away in the Defence Department forever. In the absence of the full report, he has been able to assemble only tantalising pieces of the jigsaw.\n\n'Certainly, there was detailed analysis that was done: soils removed, there were radiation detectors used, Geiger counters used,' Coulthart says.\n\n'It was the most extraordinarily intense investigation and the public has been completely left in the dark.\n\n'I suspect there was a finding [in the Westall Papers] that the object was American technology. I am convinced the Americans have been using Australia as a secret location for testing of technology - non-human technology - that became too sensitive to test in places like Area 51, the Nevada Test Range.\n\n'There's been an ongoing Cold War between the Russians, the Chinese and the Americans over who gets access to this retrieved, non-human technology - and fighting for the knowledge of how to use it and how to develop and replicate it.\n\n'We've moved beyond the argument about whether these things are real. It's been formally admitted that they're real.\n\n'What we have now is a continuing attempt at a feeble cover-up by the Pentagon and the intelligence community, which, I suspect, believes that it can derive some kind of hegemonical American military advantage from the technology that it is hiding.\n\n'That is why the public is being lied to about incidents like Westall, and why this is being concealed.'\n\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\n\nThe Westall sighting has become one of the most enduring of Australian mysteries.\n\nThe incident has not only featured in a raft of popular documentaries, but has also been commemorated at the site itself with a UFO-themed playground.\n\nHIBAL balloons were used to sample the levels of radioactive elements in the atmosphere\n\nOfficially, the Department of Defence will not comment on the existence of the Westall Papers and critics continue to dismiss Coulthart's work. However, the investigator says that despite the passage of time, he will continue to push for the release of Mr X's secret report.\n\n'I have been vilified and attacked for investigating the technology involved in these kinds of encounters,' he tells me.\n\n'Numerous people I have spoken to have told me it is routine for people who are working inside this secret program to be intimidated and threatened with death if they reveal what they know.\n\n'But there is no amount of intimidation or bullying or threats that will stop me from investigating this. It's too far down the track.\n\n'This is the biggest story in human history, and I know it's real.'"

partly through techniques within the classroom; and partly through the narratives attached to the sciences.\n\n'Specifically, the curriculum should offer children a chance to learn about historic Western and non-Western contributions to the sciences, as well as cutting-edge contemporary research from diverse teams of scientists.\n\n'Teachers should be encouraged to frame historic examples of scientific discoveries in the context that some individuals, groups, cultures and nations were disadvantaged in their ability to participate in or to resource research and less able to claim credit and ownership for ideas that had been developed by them.'\n\nThe Royal Society of Biology also said it had sought expertise on 'decolonising the curriculum' and for a 'no more heroes' approach to teaching science in schools.\n\nThis would mean 'avoiding prescriptive lists of historic figures in biology' and instead 'exploring opportunities for local, recogniseable, diverse historic and contemporary figures through which discovery and exploration of biological concepts can be explored'.\n\nIt added that students should be encouraged to 'see a wide range of biologists in action'.\n\nThe Institute for Physics suggested that 'ideas should be framed in the context of the times in which discoveries were made and accredited within Western science'.\n\nIts submission to the curriculum review added: 'They can explain how many of those discoveries drew on earlier work in other parts of the world.\n\n'And how, during the period of growth of Western science, different groups, cultures and nations were more or less able to participate in research, resource scientific activity, or claim credit and ownership for ideas.'\n\nThe Royal Statistical Society called for the greater use of 'real-world data' - such as on gender inequalities or migration - in the teaching of maths and statistics.\n\n'The curriculum should be focused on solving problems using data rather than answering questions about data,' its submission added.\n\nTeaching unions are also among groups to have submitted evidence to the curriculum review.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders said the current curriculum 'prioritises a somewhat monocultural worldview, especially with regards to literature and history'.\n\nMs Phillipson has hailed the review as an 'important step in this Government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity, deliver better life chances and enable more young people to get on'.\n\nThe review is being chaired by Professor Becky Francis, who has spearheaded research into educational inequalities.\n\nTory MP Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said: 'Labour's curriculum changes will drive down educational standards.\n\n'Instead of continuing with a rich, knowledge-based curriculum which has led to our children being the best readers and mathematicians in the Western world, they are tearing it all up.\n\n'Pure education vandalism once again.'\n\nReform UK deputy leader Richard Tice hit out at 'a ludicrous proposal from the wokerati'.\n\nHe added: 'We need more historic British heroes and achievements to be taught to our children, not less.'"

            "article_content": "Google recently unveiled its latest quantum processor, named \u2018Willow\u2019. The research team that built it also tested it and the results were published in Nature.\n\nThey created a great level of buzz about the realisability of quantum computers that could tackle many practical problems.\n\nThe results also kicked up intriguing debates about explaining the power of quantum information processing and how they could solve problems that even the most powerful classical computers struggle with.\n\nBit versus qubit\n\nComputers process information stored in an array of 0s and 1s. In classical computers, some physical system with two possible states is used to represent these 0s and 1s. These physical systems are called bits. A common example is an electric circuit that allows two levels of voltage, one called 0 and the other called 1. A classical computer is a collection of bits together, and the information flowing in and out of bits is controlled and manipulated by physical operations called gate operations. For example, an AND gate accepts two inputs, each either 0 or 1, and outputs 1 if both inputs are 1 and 0 for any other combination of inputs.\n\nA quantum bit, or qubit, has two distinct states representing 0 and 1. More importantly, a qubit can be in states that are also combinations of 0 and 1. This feature is called quantum superposition. Classical bits can\u2019t do this. Because of this ability, each qubit needs two distinct numbers to represent the contributions of 0 and 1 respectively in the qubit\u2019s state. If we have two bits, we need two numbers, one for each bit, to represent the state of the collection. With two quantum bits, we need four numbers to represent the state. For 10 bits, we need 10 numbers to represent the state of the collection. For ten qubits, we need 210 (1,024) numbers.\n\nThis exponential growth in the information required to represent qubits\u2019 states and the superposition of states are the major reasons why quantum computers could be more efficient and powerful than classical computers. Like a classical computer, a quantum computer is also a collection of qubits and a host of physical operations called quantum gates that change the states of qubits to perform calculations.\n\nDifficult to isolate\n\nA major impediment to realising quantum computers is the fragile nature of quantum states. Specifically, while classical bits are robust and long-lasting, qubits are fragile and collapse quickly at the slightest disturbance. This in turn limits the amount of time for which qubits can hold information, how errors-free the quantum computer can keep its calculations, and how well a quantum computer can be scaled.\n\nIt is difficult to isolate a physical gadget to avoid perturbations due to external noise. Therefore, computations are prone to errors. For example, when a bit is expected to represent 0, there is a small chance it may be in the state representing 1. This is called the bit flip error. Methods to identify and fix these errors are called error-correction protocols.\n\nA single 0 is represented by three bits in the state 000 (corresponding to each bit in the state 0). If there is a bit-flip error, the resulting state could be 100, 010 or 001 (depending on whether the first, second or third bit is flipped). Similarly, 1 is represented as 111. If we need to encode 01 as the basic information, its true representation is 000111. Looking at the concatenated sequence in groups of three bits, the occurrence of 100, 010, 001, 011,101 or 110 will mean an error has crept in. When three physical bits represent one logical digit, it is easy to figure out which bit has flipped and correct it suitably before the next step in the computation.\n\nSimilarly, one way to mitigate the effect of errors in a quantum computer is to correct them using additional qubits that keep track of errors creeping in during computations. This is a logical answer to the error problem, it is however unsuitable for qubits in superposed states. Creating exact copies of unknown superposed states is prohibited by the no-cloning theorem of quantum physics. On the other hand, error correction often requires redundancy, i.e. providing more qubits than what is needed to encode information. This makes it clear more than one physical qubit is needed to represent a single logical qubit. (Qubits also have another type of error called phase flip error, which presents similar challenges to error correction.)\n\nOne effective method to detect and correct errors in a quantum computer without also violating the no-cloning theorem is called surface code. Here, engineers arrange an array of qubits on a grid. The qubits are grouped into two categories, namely data qubits and measurement qubits. While the error in data qubits is what we wish to identify and correct, any attempt to measure them will force them out of superposition and whatever information they encode will be lost.\n\nTo avoid this, the surface code method provides the set of measurement qubits. These qubits are entangled with data qubits through suitable gate operations. (If two qubits are entangled, any measurement of one particle will instantaneously cause the other particle to lose its superposition state.) In this setup, the presence of errors in the data qubits is inferred by making suitable measurements of the measurement qubits, while using the gates to prevent the data qubits from being affected, and thus correcting inconsistencies in the data qubits.\n\nThe error rate\n\nAccording to Google, its new quantum processor Willow has significantly better error correction and is thus significantly faster than other quantum computers, not to mention classical computers as well. The researchers who developed it tested it by using it to solve a computationally hard problem.\n\nWillow houses 105 physical qubits and operates at temperatures close to the theoretically possible lowest temperature (0 K, -273.15\u00b0 C). Nearly half of these are data qubits and the remaining are measurement qubits. The superconducting qubits are not strictly two-state systems. When performing gate operations, the physical system can get excited or \u2018leak\u2019 to states other than 0 and 1. These excited states can subsequently interfere with the computations and introduce errors. So a few qubits \u2014 i.e. the measurement qubits \u2014 are reserved to correct such leakage errors.\n\nCoherence time is the duration over which an intended state (typically, superpositions) of a qubit can survive without being changed due to interactions with the environment or with other parts of the computer. The coherence time of data qubits on Willow is about 100 microseconds, which is more than the coherence time of the physical qubits. This is a consequence of the error correction protocols used. This in itself is an interesting result because it means the information-holding time can be improved by external manoeuvring.\n\nThe next milestone for researchers to achieve is to lower the error rate \u2014 calculated as the ratio of the number of qubit errors to the number of gate operations \u2014 as they build ever-larger quantum computers with more physical qubits and more error correction operations. Google alone has progressed from 3-by-3 to 5-by-5 to 7-by-7 arrays of data qubits, and the error rate has decreased by more than half in each step.\n\nWhat one expects for a collection of qubits on a circuit is that the error rate either remains the same or increases as the number of qubits is increased. That the error rate becomes smaller as more qubits are added is the below-the-threshold capability of Willow\u2019s architecture and operation. This is vital to achieve quantum processors with enough qubits that perform almost error-free computations of problems of practical relevance \u2014 the ultimate goal.\n\nNo dead-ends\n\nThe particular computationally difficult task with which Google tested Willow is called random circuit sampling (RCS). In the RCS task, Willow has to calculate the probability of occurrence of possible strings of 0s and 1s in the output when the quantum gates that act on the qubits are chosen randomly. If there is no noise, RCS is a computationally hard task, meaning that the number of calculations required to make the prediction increases exponentially with the input size.\n\nWillow completed the RCS task for random gate operations realisable on Willow in a few minutes. The researchers estimated that the same task on the most powerful classical computer available today would take 10 septillion years (i.e. 1 followed by 24 zeroes). To compare, the universe\u2019s age in years is approximately 1 followed by 10 zeroes. It is plausible that classical computers running better algorithms may eventually match Willow\u2019s feat, although researchers are not aware of such improvements today.\n\nResearchers are still a long way away from realising quantum processors of reasonable size to be useful in practical contexts. This said, it\u2019s only natural that Willow created the sort of buzz that it did: it has shown that the major issues in realising a reliable quantum computer can be addressed and surmounted, that they are not dead-ends. The work of the Google team provides hope that quantum computers may soon help us unravel nature\u2019s mysteries and also solve computationally difficult problems in drug design, materials science, climate modelling, and optimisation, among others \u2014 all with deep societal impact.\n\nS.
