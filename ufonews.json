What if you were a high-profile politician? Would you admit it, or would you be silenced by the stigma that often accompanies such out-of-this-world tales?\n\nA lawmaker who would eventually become the 39th president of the United States reported his encounter, and the reaction may surprise you.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know this, but the late former president Jimmy Carter saw a color-changing U.F.O. in Georgia back in 1969.\n\nHis willingness to discuss it leaves behind a unique legacy of openness about U.F.O. sightings.\n\nAmericans honor former President Jimmy Carter\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter\u2019s personal encounter happened outside a Lions club in Leary, Georgia. He was with a group of about two dozen witnesses who all saw a bright orb changing colors from blue to red to white. According to history.com., the orb moved toward and away from the crowd, stopped, and then disappeared behind pine trees. Carter said the object was self-illuminated and not solid in nature. It was in view for about 12 minutes before it passed out of sight.\n\nWhen Carter was governor in 1973, he filed an official report with the International U.F.O. Bureau. He spoke freely about the encounter and even promised, during his 1976 presidential campaign, to release all government information if elected.\n\nAccording to reports, he backed away from his pledge, citing security concerns and defense implications.\n\nA member of the Carter family did some research and decided it was likely from the release of a glowing chemical cloud produced by rockets launched from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Some of these sodium and barium chemical clouds were visible by the scattering of sunlight as far away as Leary, Georgia, appearing around the same time of the sighting. A copy of this report is at the Jimmy Carter Library.\n\nCarter is quoted as saying, \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll never make fun of people who say they\u2019ve seen unidentified objects in the sky.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter left a message cast to the cosmos in 1977.\n\nUSA Today reports that in a message sent to space, along with recordings of Earth\u2019s music, languages, and images, Carter left a message on a golden record launched on the space probe, Voyager 1, saying, in part, \u201cWe hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations.\u201d The message continues to travel beyond our solar system today.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Credit: H. Christoph / ullstein bild / contributor via Getty Images\n\nAfter calls with foreign leaders, rap sessions with lawmakers, and long classified briefings with advisers, President Jimmy Carter would often escape to the roof of the White House.\n\nThere his son Jeffrey had set up a tracking telescope, Carter said in his book, A Full Life. Feeling the weight of the world, he would gaze at the stars and contemplate his place among them.\n\n\"I recall one winter night going to the White House roof to study the Orion nebulae, but we could barely see the stars, their images so paled by city lights,\" he waxed in a poem.\n\nThat particular evening, on Dec. 18, 1977, the astrophysicist Carl Sagan joined him. They had just visited the U.S. Naval Observatory next to the vice president\u2019s mansion, where they discussed all things space \u2014 planets , stars, black holes , and astrobiology . Carter himself was a man of science: He studied engineering in college and did graduate work in nuclear physics .\n\n\"It was a welcome diversion from earthly concerns,\" he wrote in a thank-you note to Sagan.\n\nCarter, who died on Dec. 29, 2024 at 100, was an avid astronomer, with a profound curiosity for the cosmos, a part of his story that isn't well-known. It began when he was a lab assistant to an astronomy teacher his freshman year in college, and it continued as he learned celestial navigation in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. One Christmas while on a ship with his family, he asked the captain if the crew had a sextant on board, a tool for measuring the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky. The captain proceeded to show him one, he said , displayed like a museum artifact in a glass case.\n\nBut politics often eclipsed the former president's appreciation for space. Though his first budget funded the program that became NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope, Carter was maligned for not supporting human spaceflight in the vein of the Apollo program, said Steven Hochman, former special assistant to the president at the Carter Center. He was a supporter of robotic exploration and research that could benefit people's lives, but when it came to the exorbitant cost of sending astronauts into deep space , he preferred spending on domestic concerns.\n\n\"NASA, I believe, has not given him the credit he deserves,\" Hochman told Mashable. \"I believe it is because he was critical of the Space Shuttle program and didn't provide funding for future missions to the moon or Mars.\"\n\nFor years political adversaries ridiculed Carter for having a tinfoil hat, stemming from an incident in 1969 that later circulated in the press. After a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a few other men spotted something strange moving in the sky: a luminous object, first blue then red, the apparent size and brightness of the moon . About four years later, Carter reported the unidentified flying object to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter places the Congressional Space Medal around NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong's neck.

Skeptics, who likely knew nothing of Carter's astronomy background, suggested he had merely seen Venus .\n\n\"It was not Venus,\" Carter said in a 2007 interview on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast.\n\nIn fact, his UFO sighting had taken on such mythic proportions, some had wondered whether it was the reason Carter wanted NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977. Despite a White House request expressing a need to address the general UFO \"public relations problem,\" NASA had, surprisingly, declined.\n\nThe Japanese space agency JAXA's Akatsuki mission, aka Planet-C or Venus Climate Orbiter, studies the planet's atmosphere from orbit with an ultraviolet imager.

Henry, the agency's deputy director of astrophysics during Carter's administration, to write an essay about it more than a decade later. Henry, a semi-retired professor at Johns Hopkins University today, came to no definitive conclusions on why NASA rebuffed the White House. But, in a postscript , Henry said he sent his draft to Carter before publication in 1988.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Credit: NASA\n\nYet buried within Henry's paper was a small window into Carter's passion for astronomy. In November 1977, the president and his son sent a message to NASA headquarters asking to borrow a seven-inch Questar telescope. Given that there were no telescopes at headquarters \u2014 just paper, Henry said \u2014 he tried to hunt one down at another NASA campus.\n\nIt turned out Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, had one.\n\n\"By great luck, a NASA plane was flying from Huntsville to Washington the next day ([Science adviser Frank] Press was emphatic that the President wanted no special flights or other waste of taxpayer dollars),\" Henry wrote.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter sits alone on a bench at Camp David during the Egyptian-Israeli peace talks on Sept. 9, 1978. Credit: White House / CNP / Getty Images\n\nThe NASA official and his wife, Rita Mahon, picked up the Questar at Washington National Airport and promptly took it to the White House. They then unpacked the telescope from a large wooden crate and showed the Carters how to set it up on the Truman balcony overlooking the South Lawn. The night was cloudy, but they trained on the moon.\n\nThe president then proceeded to take the telescope with him to Camp David near Thurmont, Maryland, on Nov. 23, 1977, where he and his family spent Thanksgiving, according to his daily diary . He returned it about a week later.\n\nOne has to wonder if Carter brought a telescope with him again just 10 months later, when he invited Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to join him at the retreat. The renowned talks would result in the Camp David Accords , which later earned the Middle East leaders a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nU.S. President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin share a three-way handshake after signing the Camp David Accords. Credit: Bettmann / Contributor / Getty Images\n\nThere's an amusing irony to the false urban legend that Carter believed he was visited by aliens: He is, after all, the most likely person to make humanity's introduction to extraterrestrials.\n\nSome 15.5 billion miles away from Earth, hurtling through the cold, uncharted abyss, is NASA's Voyager 1 probe. It is the farthest spacecraft from home, having left the solar system in 2012. Soaring through interstellar space at 38,000 mph , it carries a gold-plated record produced by Sagan, with a melange of sounds from the planet.\n\nCrickets. Wind.

These and a letter from Carter are among the recordings on the disk.\n\nA technician puts the golden record on the Voyager spacecraft in a clean room before launch.

Galaxies are spinning away from each other into the infinite unknown. The speed at which space is expanding far outpaces our technology to overcome it. It's as if the universe were contrived to keep its inhabitants apart.\n\nBut should some other intelligent life forms encounter Voyager \u2014 or Voyager 2 , which carries a duplicate record \u2014 thousands or even billions of years into the future, they will discover Carter's words:\n\n\"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings,\" he wrote. \"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nA copy of the statement President Jimmy Carter included on the golden records for the Voyager spacecraft. Credit: NASA\n\nMany knew Carter's intimate relationship with his faith. He grew up Southern Baptist, the son of a farmer in the boomtown of Plains, Georgia. He referred to himself as a born-again Christian. Long after his presidency, he attended regular church services and taught Sunday School .\n\nBut how his evangelical beliefs squared with his thoughts on the universe aren't clear. He wrote in a poem, titled \"Considering the Void:\"\n\nWhen I behold the charm / of evening skies, their lulling endurance; / the patterns of stars with names / of bears and dogs, a swan, a virgin; / other planets that our Voyager showed / were like and so unlike our own, / with all their moons, / bright discs, weird rings, and cratered faces; / comets with their streaming tails / bent by pressure from our sun; / the skyscape of our Milky Way / holding in its shimmering disc /an infinity of suns / (or say a thousand billion); / knowing there are holes of darkness / gulping mass and even light, / knowing that this galaxy of ours / is one of multitudes / in what we call the heavens, / it troubles me. It troubles me.\n\nWhat exactly was haunting Carter? Was he expressing a collision of faith and science in what lies beyond? An existential crisis of never knowing the big picture?\n\nPerhaps, as he wished, humankind will survive this time so that we may live to know more."

He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Mossmouth LLC\n\nUFO 50 is one of the most impressive and audacious video game releases in recent memory, precisely because of what it doesn't do. There are no hyperrealistic graphics or massive open worlds. Instead, UFO 50 is a collection of 50 games that pay homage to classic titles from the 1980s. Think of it as the Well-Tempered Clavier of 8-bit gaming.\n\nThe backstory of UFO 50 is that the games are the catalog of a fictional game company from the '80s. There are platformers, shoot-'em-ups, side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, RPGs, puzzle games, turn-based strategies, a point-and-click horror adventure, Metroidvanias, dungeon crawlers, and more. The collection recreates not just the pixel graphics and chunky synth soundtracks\u2014which are delightful\u2014but the experience of dusting off a trove of video game cartridges and exploring them at your leisure.\n\nLike their inspirations, these games don't hold your hand. There are no tutorials, and part of the fun is going into a game blind and figuring out its internal logic. For those who grew up in the 1980s and '90s, it's all a heady dose of nostalgia, but these aren't merely reskinned copies of old titles or minigames. A group of independent developers spent eight years crafting them, and each one is a complete game with an original idea or twist.\n\nThe shock of UFO 50 is how consistently good all the titles are. The simple controls, tight design, and challenging-but-rewarding gameplay reminds players why video games are fun in the first place. If you've ever had trouble putting down a controller because \"just one more try,\" you will become obsessed with at least one\u2014more likely several\u2014of UFO 50's offerings.\n\nThe post Review: UFO 50 Pays Homage to '80s Video Games appeared first on Reason.com."

            "article_content": "Adam Spatacco\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWithout question, semiconductor stocks have been some of the biggest winners amid the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While stars such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom fetch the most attention, investing in the chip sector at large during the past two years has yielded market-beating returns.\n\nAs of market close on Dec. 20, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF had gained 39% in 2024 \u2014 handily topping the returns of both the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nNevertheless, not all semiconductor stocks have fared so well. Take Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), for example \u2014 with shares up a piddling 6% in 2024, investors might think this particular chip stock is a bust.\n\nSmart investors know that looking at the return of a stock is just one variable when assessing an opportunity. Below, I'm going to dig into what has influenced Micron's price action throughout the year and make the case for why 2025 could be a rebound year for the company.\n\nMicron stock just got smoked\n\nThe chart below illustrates movement in Micron shares throughout 2024. The peaks and valleys depicted in the graph make one thing abundantly clear \u2014 Micron is pretty volatile. In particular, the last six months have been abnormally rocky with shares dropping by about 38% since June.\n\nMy take on what's causing Micron shares to experience so much volatility comes down to one thing: expectations. When businesses such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom and many others exhibit robust growth on a consistent basis, investors tend to apply these trends to other companies in the same industry.\n\nAlthough I understand the psychological factors behind these parallels, it's imperative for investors to understand that such a notion is rooted in faulty logic. Not all chip companies manufacture the same products or serve the same purpose, and for that reason, each business is going to experience its own set of unique headwinds and catalysts.\n\nMicron's position in the AI realm focuses on memory and storage applications. Although the company has had impressive top-line growth that's augmented by rising profitability, Micron's forecast for a big miss in its 2025 fiscal second quarter spooked investors.\n\nAgain, I don't necessarily see this as a reason to sell the stock. Below, I'll dig into why Micron's latest plunge is unwarranted.\n\nThe shares could rebound in 2025\n\nSince AI emerged as the world's next megatrend about two years ago, one product in particular has become the technology sector's holy grail: graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nCompanies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices develop chipsets known as GPUs that are capable of running complex algorithms at extremely high speeds, and it's this hardware that powers myriad generative AI applications. Taking this a step further, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures GPUs for Nvidia and AMD while Broadcom supplies a host of network infrastructure equipment needed to power data centers where these GPUs are housed.\n\nWith all of that in mind, doesn't it seem natural that those specific businesses have experienced abnormally high growth during the past two years?\n\nIn my eyes, Micron just hasn't had its moment yet, but I think it's coming. Considering investments in AI infrastructure are expected to be in the trillions of dollars during the next several years, I think it's safe to say that demand for GPUs and data center services isn't going to slow.\n\nAt a more granular level, this means that training and inferencing workloads are going to become more sophisticated and mission critical as competition in the AI arms race intensifies. It's this dynamic that should result in a greater need for memory and storage protocols \u2014 and Micron is extremely well-positioned to capture that demand.\n\nThis isn't just lofty theory, either. Per Micron's 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 28), the company's data-center revenue increased by a staggering 400% year over year and reached a record level. Furthermore, the company's data-center segment now accounts for more than 50% of the business. To me, these trends underscore the need for Micron's memory chips and I expect the tailwinds to carry into next year and beyond.\n\nAlthough the company's near-term outlook may not have lived up to expectations, I think the long-term narrative is still very much in focus. According to management, the total addressable market for high bandwidth memory is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030 \u2014 more than six times what it is today. Considering Micron's trailing-12-month revenue is in the ballpark of $29 billion, I think the company has significant upside.\n\nIs Micron stock a buy right now?\n\nValuing Micron is a daunting task. Even though the company generates positive earnings, it has only recently transitioned to a profitable enterprise and so using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seems a little out of place, in my opinion.\n\nInstead, I'll use the PEG ratio to assess an investment in Micron. The PEG ratio looks at analyst forecasts for earnings growth over several years. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, the stock could be seen as undervalued. Right now, Micron's PEG ratio is just 0.23.\n\nIn my opinion, Micron's low PEG suggests that investors could be overlooking the need for memory and storage chips as AI workloads become larger and more complex. Over time, however, I think the need for Micron's services will become increasingly obvious. To me, buying Micron right now is a bargain opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Nvidia.

PHOTO: ELLIUS GRACE/NYTIMES\n\nNEW YORK - Fable, a popular app for talking about and tracking books, is changing the way it creates personalised summaries for its users after complaints that an artificial intelligence model used offensive language.\n\nIn an Instagram post this week, Mr Chris Gallello, the head of product at Fable, addressed the problem of AI-generated summaries on the app, saying that Fable began receiving complaints about \u201cvery bigoted racist language, and that was shocking to us\u201d.\n\nHe gave no examples, but he was apparently referring to at least one Fable reader\u2019s summary posted as a screenshot on Threads, which rounded up the book choices the reader, Ms Tiana Trammell, had made, saying: \u201cYour journey dives deep into the heart of Black narratives and transformative tales, leaving mainstream stories gasping for air. Don\u2019t forget to surface for the occasional white author, okay?\u201d.\n\nFable replied in a comment under the post, saying that a team would work to resolve the problem. In his longer statement on Instagram, Mr Gallello said that the company would introduce safeguards.\n\nThese included disclosures that summaries were generated by artificial intelligence, the ability to opt out of them and a thumbs-down button that would alert the app to a potential problem.\n\nMs Trammell, who lives in Detroit, downloaded Fable in October 2024 to track her reading. Around Christmas, she had read books that prompted summaries related to the holiday. But just before the new year, she finished three books by Black authors.\n\nOn Dec 29, when Ms Trammell saw her Fable summary, she was stunned.\n\n\u201cI thought: \u2018This cannot be what I am seeing. I am clearly missing something here,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview on Jan 3.\n\nShe shared the summary with fellow book club members and on Fable, where others shared offensive summaries that they, too, had received or seen.\n\nOne person who read books about people with disabilities was told her choices \u201ccould earn an eye-roll from a sloth\u201d. Another said a reader\u2019s books were \u201cmaking me wonder if you\u2019re ever in the mood for a straight, cis white man\u2019s perspective\u201d.\n\nFable\u2019s head of community, Ms Kim Marsh Allee, said in an e-mail on Jan 3 that two users received summaries \u201cthat are completely unacceptable to us as a company and do not reflect our values\u201d.\n\nShe said all of the features that use AI were being removed, including summaries and year-end reading wraps, and a new app version was being submitted to the app store.

The outage began on December 26th, 2024 at 10:40 AM and was mostly resolved by 3:11 PM, except for except ChatGPT which was 100% recovered by 6:20 PM.\n\nThe following services were impacted:\n\nChatGPT\n\nSora video creation\n\nAPIs: agents, realtime speech, batch, and DALL-E\n\nCause of OpenAI Outage\n\nThe cause of the outage was a cloud provider data center failure which impacted OpenAI databases. While the databases are mirrored across regions, switching over to a backup database required manual interaction on the part of the cloud provider to redirect operations to a backup datacenter in another region. The manual intervention was cited as how the outage was fixed but the given reason for why it took so long was the scale of the project.\n\nA failover is an automated process for switching to a backup system in the event of a system failure. OpenAI announced that they are working toward creating infrastructure changes to improve responses to future cloud database failures.\n\nOpenAI explained:\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will embark on a major infrastructure initiative to ensure our systems are resilient to an extended outage in any region of any of our cloud providers by adding a layer of indirection under our control in between our applications and our cloud databases. This will allow significantly faster failover.\u201d\n\nSignificant ChatGPT Outage\n\nOpenAI\u2019s said the ChatGPT outage was due to a regional cloud provider database failure but the effect was global, evidenced by user reports on social media from across Europe and North America.\n\nGoogle Trends, which tracks search volume, indicates that this may have been the largest such event, with more people searching for information about it than for any previous outage.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/lilgrapher"

            "category": "openai",
            "date": "4h",
            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "Equity analyst Dan Ives has made a quite a few prescient calls in his career. In the last year alone, he predicted the Nasdaq Composite would hit 20,000, and he remained bullish on Palantir despite widespread skepticism. Lo and behold, the Nasdaq hit 20,000 in 2024, and Palantir was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 index.\n\nThis year, Ives thinks Apple (AAPL -0.20%) and Microsoft (MSFT 1.14%) will become the first $4 trillion companies, as detailed below:\n\nIves recently raised his 12-month target on Apple to $325 per share. That implies about 34% upside from its current share price of $242. If he is correct, Apple would have a market value of $4.9 trillion by year-end in 2025.\n\nIves has set Microsoft with a 12-month target of $550 per share. That implies about 31% upside from its current share price of $419. If he is correct, Microsoft would have a market value just above $4 trillion by year-end in 2025.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Apple and Microsoft.\n\n1. Apple\n\nIn 2024, consultancy Brand Finance ranked Apple as the most valuable brand in the world for the third time in four years. Apple is best known for its premium electronics devices, but the company has also built loyalty through its services business, which includes value-added products like iCloud storage, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+.\n\nApple was slow to respond to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but the company late last year introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features available on newer iPad, iPhone, and MacBook models. While the initial response has been somewhat muted in terms of consumer demand, CEO Tim Cook recently told analysts it would usher in a \"new era for the iPhone.\"\n\nDan Ives is equally optimistic. He thinks Apple Intelligence will be the catalyst that drives a massive upgrade cycle. In fact, Ives in a September interview with Schwab Network predicted Apple would record its strongest iPhone unit sales in history in the next year. And more recently, he said the upgrade cycle could drive the company's market value to $5 trillion within 18 months.\n\nApple reported pretty good financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in September. Revenue rose 6% on mid-single-digit growth in MacBook, iPad, and iPhone sales, and double-digit growth in services. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income climbed 9% to $25 billion, but earnings per share jumped 12% as the company continued to repurchase stock aggressively.\n\nApple Intelligence could certainly be a major catalyst in the coming years, especially given that Apple is the revenue leader in the smartphone market. But management has yet to articulate a long-term strategy that incorporates AI into the services business. Ives says the company will monetize Apple Intelligence with App Store fees as developers build AI into mobile applications. But without some input from management, I find it difficult to be bullish.\n\nAdding to my skepticism, Apple currently trades at 40 times earnings. That is well above the three-year average of 29 times earnings, and the multiple itself is hard to justify when Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 10% annually in the next three years. Dan Ives has an excellent reputation, but I think investors should wait for a better entry point, or else more evidence that Wall Street has grossly underestimated future earnings.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is the largest software company in the world in terms of revenue. While it is best known for its office productivity tools, the company also has a strong presence in other verticals, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, and cybersecurity. Microsoft has introduced generative AI copilots that create new monetization opportunities across its software portfolio.\n\nBeyond software, Microsoft has a strong presence in cloud computing. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services provider in terms in terms of sales, and it's well positioned to gain share. Its partnership with OpenAI is a key advantage because it makes Azure the exclusive cloud provider to the AI start-up. That lets Microsoft indirectly monetize ChatGPT usage, and it allows Azure customers to build generative AI applications with OpenAI models.\n\nMicrosoft reported reasonably good financial results in the third quarter. Revenue rose 16% to $65.6 billion on strong sales growth in software, cloud services, and advertising, though its acquisition of Activision added 3 points to top-line growth. But GAAP earnings rose just 10% to $3.30 per diluted share as investments in AI infrastructure weighed on gross margin. The company also gave disappointing guidance, causing shares to slide following the report.\n\nOne reason for the weak guidance is an anticipated $1.5 billion headwind to income in the current quarter due to its share of losses at OpenAI. But that is a temporary problem. Per the terms of the partnership, Microsoft should not only recoup its $13 billion investment in the AI start-up, but will also collect a hefty portion of its earnings once the company reaches profitability. In other words, the headwind should eventually become a tailwind.\n\nThe partnership with OpenAI also creates an onramp to Azure. For instance, usage of Azure OpenAI -- a service that lets developers access OpenAI models -- more than doubled in the past six months. That has contributed to the company's ability to monetize AI, and Microsoft is on pace to earn $10 billion in AI revenue in the next quarter. No product in company history hit that milestone faster, according to CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nWhile the business is solid, Microsoft's valuation is also expensive. The stock trades at 35 times earnings, a premium to the three-year average of 32 times earnings. And the multiple itself is hard to justify when Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 13% annually in the next three years. Again, Ives has an impressive track record where technology stocks are concerned, but I think investors should wait for a better entry point."

            "article_content": "OpenAI's o3 AI model recently achieved 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, similar to human-level performance. Though impressive, experts caution that it does not necessarily mean true human-level intelligence because its architecture and methods are undisclosed.\n\nOpenAI has just released its o3 series of AI models that focus on reasoning capabilities. So far, they have demonstrated excellent performance in internal benchmarks and raised questions about the potential for such intelligence. Even though scores are impressive, one needs to see whether the o3 model reaches human-level intelligence or if it is merely an improved version of earlier models.\n\nThe o3 model scored 85 percent on the ARC-AGI benchmark, a test that measures reasoning and spatial understanding. This score is 30 percent better than the previous best score, and the result matches the average score of humans on the same test. This achievement may suggest that o3 is close to human-level reasoning, but the reality may be more complex.\n\nWhat Does This Benchmark Score Really Mean?\n\nDespite the stellar score, however, we do not immediately believe that the capability of the model o3 was equivalent to humans. The scoring is not detailed enough to judge the capabilities and capabilities of AI. Open AI has not given detailed information about what architecture, methodology, or databases were used during training for creating o3 and therefore cannot pinpoint whether it can be called really intelligent.\n\nThe o3 model is the continuation of the o-series. It is an improvement on its architecture rather than a complete overhaul. For example, the o1 series introduced the method of test-time compute, allowing the model to use extra time for processing solutions and testing theories. GPT-4o was also a fine-tuned version of GPT-4.\n\nConsidering the fact that OpenAI is reported to be developing GPT-5, the o3 model does not seem to be a new architectural design. Rather, the company has probably been optimizing the model for better performance in reasoning tasks.\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark is comprised of grid-based pattern recognition questions that require reasoning and spatial reasoning. Good performance on such a test would mean an AI model having an excellent amount of robust dataset focused on logic and reasoning. But the test is not that simple-it has been thought so before. If that were possible, the score of the previous best would have been much higher. The previous best scored at 55 percent, which indicates that o3 left the others way behind with its well-refined techniques and algorithms.\n\nIs o3 Really Near AGI?\n\nWhile an 85 percent score for o3 is quite impressive, it does not imply that the model has reached AGI. Developing AGI would be a far greater breakthrough than this and would have a very significant impact on the partnership of OpenAI with Microsoft. If OpenAI had indeed achieved AGI, the company would probably have made a much more public announcement.\n\nAI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, have also emphasized that AGI remains years away. If the o3 model were close to AGI, OpenAI would likely be more transparent about this milestone.\n\nThe o3 model is a step forward in AI development, but the pursuit of true AGI is still a long way off.\n\nALSO READ | Apple Agrees to Pay $95 Million to Settle Siri Eavesdropping Lawsuit"

In the current study, investigators characterized trends in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, health care costs, and procedural utilization.\n\nThe investigators conducted a retrospective analysis using discharge data and ICD-10 codes from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016 to 2021 (costs adjusted and reported in 2023 dollars). The NIS is the largest all-payer, encounter-level database in the US for hospitalizations (about 7 million deidentified hospitalizations/year).\n\nThe investigators noted in 2021, the 4,687,370 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the US cost $108 billion. The highest costs, $18.5 billion, were accounted for by heart failure (HF), $11.2 billion by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), and $10.9 billion by stroke. Adults aged at least 65 years accounted for 64% of all cardiac-related hospitalizations, and those aged 45 to 64 years accounted for 30% (55% men; 70% White; 16% Black; 9% Hispanic).\n\n\u201c \u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, significant upward trends were noted in the following:\n\nHF\n\nStroke\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSTEMI\n\nChest pain\n\nHypertensive emergency\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nAortic dissection\n\nSudden cardiac death\n\nPericarditis\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia\n\nPulmonary heart disease\n\nTotal costs increased over $10 billion across the study period, although not linearly, with significant declines likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Total CV-related costs by 2030 may reach $131.3 billion.\n\nProcedures most performed in all years included coronary, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\nStudy limitations include ICD codes may underreport primary diagnoses, NIS data are event-level related to discharge with unclear interpretation of how readmissions affect the data, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and costs was undetermined.\n\n\u201cOverall, from the years 2016 to 2021, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends,\u201d the investigators wrote. \u201c\u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Some [or one] study author(s) declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

            "article_content": "On a university level, what makes for a good computer science curriculum?\n\nOne of the most common career paths for a computer science major is as a software developer. An effective university curriculum must prepare computer science students with the skills needed to be successful in their careers as developers.\n\nThe field of software development, however, changes faster than the Boston weather. A curriculum focused on current industry trends risks becoming obsolete before students even graduate. So how can Northeastern teach students skills that will stand the test of time? The university, which recently announced it would completely overhaul its curriculum, must carefully and thoughtfully consider this question.\n\nA good computer science curriculum must emphasize fundamental principles that are widely applicable, enabling students to easily adapt to new technologies in the field they are entering. It must teach students how to think about software and how to problem-solve.\n\nThis is exactly what Northeastern\u2019s current curriculum strives to do. Fundamentals of Computer Science, or \u201cFundies,\u201d as it is popularly known, teaches systematic program design through the design recipe, which provides a consistent formula for tackling unfamiliar problems. The design recipe breaks down a problem into small, achievable steps, of which the first few require students to think carefully about the problem before writing code to solve it. Core classes such as Fundies 1, Fundies 2, Object-Oriented Design and Software Development focus on training students to reason about code, rather than to mindlessly write it.\n\nOf course, the curriculum is not perfect; no curriculum will ever be. But students\u2019 criticisms of these courses often fundamentally misunderstand their purpose.\n\nI have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a \u201cuseful language\u201d like Python. But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket \u2014 it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends.\n\nBut now, during the worst tech job market in over two decades, Khoury College of Computer Sciences plans to abandon the approach that has consistently equipped its graduates for success. The college\u2019s proposed overhaul will phase out Fundies 1, Fundies 2, and Object-Oriented Design, replacing them with entirely new courses.\n\nThe new courses will primarily teach Python, and the college claims it is an added bonus that Python \u201cis currently the most requested language by co-op employers.\u201d But we should not teach a language simply because it is currently popular in industry \u2014 we must choose a language with real pedagogical merit. Racket was chosen because it has \u201cteaching languages\u201d that can gradually introduce features as students are taught the relevant design principles. While the new curriculum begins in Pyret, which is similarly designed for teaching purposes, it will quickly transition to Python in the first course. Python does not have anything similar \u2014 students must be taught complex features upfront, before they learn the design skills to cleanly and effectively use those features.\n\nAdditionally, Khoury said students will be allowed to place out of the new courses with AP Computer Science credit. The current curriculum does not allow this for a good reason: The AP courses do not teach systematic design skills and thus are not equivalent to our introductory courses. Fundies 1 and 2 provide practice applying design principles to small problems, preparing students to design larger pieces of software in Object-Oriented Design and Software Development, as well as on co-op. If students are allowed to skip the introductory courses, they will struggle to succeed in more advanced courses and in their career.\n\nTaken together, the announced changes make it clear that while Khoury may pay lip service to the design recipe, it is not committed to maintaining systematic program design as a central aspect of the curriculum. This is a grave mistake. The program design skills that our current curriculum emphasizes are \u201cwhat distinguishes a garage programmer from a serious software developer,\u201d in the words of the Fundies 1 textbook. If Khoury abandons its design-oriented curriculum, it will fail in its duty to properly prepare students for their careers as serious software developers.\n\nIt seems a major impetus for this change is a desire to make the core curriculum easier. I know one professor who has been telling students that the college wants to reduce the number of students who withdraw from Fundies 2 and Object-Oriented Design. While this is an understandable sentiment, it would be a mistake to remove the most important parts of the curriculum to do so.\n\nAs a former teaching assistant, or TA, for Object-Oriented Design, I have seen many students struggle through the class. But I have also seen those same students become better programmers because of what they learn in that class. The \u201ccode swap\u201d at the end of the semester, where students are required to build upon other students\u2019 code, is one of the assignments students struggle most with \u2014 but it teaches them how to work in a codebase written by someone else, which they will have to do throughout their careers. Additionally, for many students, the class provides their first experience working on a large software project, much like those they will work on during their co-ops. Watering down the curriculum would not benefit these students. Is the purpose of a university to hand out grades or to educate students?\n\nAt the very least, Khoury administrators should consult with experienced teaching assistants about any planned changes to the core curriculum. TAs have a unique perspective \u2014 we have taken these courses ourselves and have also helped other students succeed. We know firsthand what works, and we can help ensure the core principles are not compromised while allowing for changes that benefit students.\n\nI love Northeastern and have never regretted my decision to attend college here. But if Khoury abandons the valuable principles of the current curriculum, I will not be able to recommend in good conscience that prospective computer science majors apply here. I will not be able to recommend in good conscience that employers hire software developers from here. If Khoury makes these changes, it will be the beginning of the end of Northeastern\u2019s computer science program.\n\nDerek Kaplan is a fourth-year computer science major.

            "article_content": "The sun sends out a constant flow of charged particles called the solar wind, which ultimately travels past all the planets to some three times the distance to Pluto before being impeded by the interstellar medium. This forms a giant bubble around the sun and its planets, known as the heliosphere.\n\nIf our solar system were to lose a few moons or even a planet, the difference might be hard to notice\u2014but lose the sun, and everything changes. Despite its role as neighborhood linchpin, however, scientists still have a whole host of questions about how the sun works and how it influences our daily life on Earth and in space. And 2025 is poised to play a key role in getting answers.\n\nThree factors are combining to make the coming year particularly exciting for the discipline known as heliophysics: the sun\u2019s natural activity cycle, a fleet of spacecraft launches and the release of a blueprint designed to guide the next decade of work in the field.\n\nRight now the sun is in the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, where scientists expect it to remain for perhaps another year or so before its activity begins to wane. And although the current Solar Cycle 25 isn\u2019t breaking any records, it has produced a host of solar flares and other spectacular outbursts that scientists have been able to monitor with recent new instruments. Those observers include both the largest solar telescope ever built and a spacecraft that has made the closest approach to the sun in history.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd this year those groundbreaking projects will get plenty of new company; NASA alone expects to launch half a dozen missions to study the sun and the myriad ways it shapes the solar system. Among them are the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, designed to help scientists map the outer limits of the sun\u2019s sphere of influence; the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, or ESCAPADE, a pair of spacecraft that will orbit Mars to study the Red Planet\u2019s experience of space weather; and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, or PUNCH, mission, which combines four small satellites orbiting Earth to study the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, or corona.\n\nMoreover, U.S. heliophysicists have a new so-called decadal report, a blueprint for the coming decade that sketches out a host of national science priorities, that was released last month and that federal agencies will begin implementing in the coming year. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d says Joe Westlake, a heliophysicist and director of the Heliophysics Division of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate.\n\n\u201cThese decadals are aspirational views of our future,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s some really good stuff in this one.\u201d\n\nFor future spacecraft missions, the report recommends that NASA pursue two large projects. One mission would consist of a total of 26 spacecraft: Two would be stationed high above our planet\u2019s poles in circular orbits and would take images of auroras and Earth\u2019s magnetic field from afar. The rest would be located in more elliptical orbits that pass through the geomagnetic field, where they would gather local observations of its strength and nearby plasma. \u201cTwenty-plus spacecraft and the ability to put those all together at the same time, looking down, looking up and collecting observations, is going to be such an incredible dataset tool for us,\u201d says Nicki Rayl, acting deputy director of the Heliophysics Division. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe second large project would be a spacecraft designed to swoop over both poles of the sun several times over the course of an entire 11-year solar activity cycle. A current NASA mission, the Parker Solar Probe, has been diving ever closer to the sun\u2019s surface, but it has stuck to observing the sun over its equatorial region. Meanwhile an ongoing European Space Agency mission called Solar Orbiter has provided only partial views of the solar poles. Consequently, our star\u2019s poles remain mysterious regions, even as they play a key role in the evolution of the sun\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGoing to the poles of the sun is hard, and it\u2019s a tricky environment to get into,\u201d Rayl says. \u201cThat\u2019s the next unknown territory.\u201d\n\nOn Earth, these ambitious missions would be augmented by the Next Generation Global Oscillations Network Group (ngGONG), which builds on the existing GONG group of observatories that began work in 1995. These observatories are spread around the world to keep the sun in their sights throughout the day, and they use a technique called helioseismology to study the solar interior by observing waves passing through it, much as geologists employ seismology to study the interior of Earth.\n\n\u201cSome of these audacious, incredible goals that are in the decadal help us really jump into the unknowns and do some discovery science,\u201d Rayl says. And in the meantime, she notes, the missions launching in the coming year will yield ever more insights\u2014and new questions to ask\u2014about the sun. \u201cI\u2019m just thrilled that we\u2019re going to be in the data-collection mode,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s go time.\u201d"

Kohli was also among the Indian fielders who surrounded the 19-year-old as he walked off the field in Sydney.\n\nKonstas had reportedly provoked Bumrah with aggressive remarks while defending Khawaja, who had been accused of deliberate time-wasting to avoid facing more overs in fading light.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, McDonald said, \u201cI checked in with Sam to make sure he was okay. India\u2019s celebration was clearly intimidating, and we have a duty of care to ensure our players are in the right mindset to perform.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile everything was within the Laws of the Game and no charges were laid, having the opposition swarm a non-striker like that raises questions. We just wanted to ensure Sam was in a good headspace for the next day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that it\u2019s acceptable because there were no fines or punishments,\u201d McDonald further said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to the ICC and obviously Andy Pycroft being the match referee and the umpires out there.\n\n\u201cIf they thought that it was satisfactory, then I suppose that\u2019s the benchmark we\u2019re playing amongst.\u201d"

That's the idea behind its new e-bike that's part bike, scooter, and motorcycle, all in one.\n\nIt's called, simply, One. And according to the specs provided by Owlet, this thing can get up and move in a hurry.\n\nThe One's 3,000-watt hub motor can generate a whopping 180 newton-meters of torque. For comparison's sake, the Specialized Turbo Levo, the benchmark for high-quality and powerful e-mountain bikes, produces \"only\" 90 newton-meters of torque. It also requires pedaling.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot so with the One.\n\nThe One is shaped like a telescope tube with a reverse-swooping rear triangle and a suspension fork hidden by cool-looking angular panels. It also folds so it can fit in a trunk or the hallway of a small apartment.\n\nIt boasts big, visible lighting too. The front beams are provided by two small circles that look a bit like eyes. The rear light is a bright red circle that can't be missed by drivers approaching from behind.\n\nOnce out on the road, you flip the collapsible foot pegs into go-mode, hit the throttle, and you're off \u2014 going up to 30 miles per hour. Owlet says the battery is good for up to 60 miles per charge. It takes about 3.5 hours to fully charge it, according to New Atlas, so it's a dream commuter rig. You could even charge it at work putting in just half a day.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis kind of transportation option has the potential to reshape urban commuting. With a top speed of 30 miles per hour, it can zip along with, or faster, than traffic in congested cities and compact towns. It's remarkably efficient, as you could likely go days without charging \u2014 unless you're joyriding around town.\n\nAnd that fun is a huge selling point. Why drive a car or use a ride-share service when you can just hop on your One and zip off quietly, quickly, and with an ear-to-ear grin plastered across your face? Imagine the possibilities of a much quieter, cleaner, and more fun cityscape, with commuters whizzing around on silent e-bikes.\n\nWould you be more likely to use a rideshare service that offers EV rides?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThe Owlet is projected to cost just under $3,000 when it goes on sale, according to New Atlas. Pre-orders are sold out on the company's website, but good things come to those who wait. Keep an eye out for this little wonder; it shouldn't be hard to spot.\n\nTo New Atlas, the design team behind the One said it creates \"not just vehicles but pieces of art, exemplifying a perfect blend of form and function.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Why the Redmagic is unique A special button for a special mode Gaming on a big screen Where wired connection rules The Redmagic 9S Pro is oddly satisfying\n\nComparison is the thief of joy, it is widely claimed. As a \u201990s kid \u2014 and now a glum adult \u2014 I would like to contend that and swear that nothing eradicates joy from everyday existence faster than back pain. Therefore, the primary purpose of my existence is to eliminate inconveniences for my back, and so, my preferred mode of gaming is away from a stiff chair and in the warm embrace of a cushy couch where I can sit wrapped in a blanket.\n\nGaming consoles \u2014 or even a Windows laptop hooked to a wireless controller and to a TV or a large display \u2014 can fulfill that requirement. But when I wish to distract myself from the sullenness of working from home and not really engage in hardcore gaming, I find myself reaching out to my phone and not a gaming console. Sadly, though, the ease of gaming on a phone accompanies the immediate regret in the form of neck pain. Hence, with the turning of the year, I am placing my bets on a phone that doubles as a gaming console with the help of specialized tools to aid in connecting to a larger display \u2014 monitor, TV, or projector.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the Redmagic 9S Pro, a phone dedicated to gaming. Below, I will take you through all the ways the phone can be utilized for gaming on a large screen and explain why you would want to consider buying one, especially if you like casual gaming without much commitment. Before that, here\u2019s a brief introduction to the phone.\n\nWhy the Redmagic is unique\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s unusual cyberpunk aesthetic already makes you believe it is a one-of-a-kind phone. No matter the angle you look at it, it unequivocally amazes you with its distinctive appearance. Despite the sharp edges and neat skin, the designs feel very refined.\n\nRedmagic has nailed some of the firsts as a phone company before gaming phones became a norm. It introduced capacitive trigger buttons to help you be better at gaming. Additionally, a high-speed fan is built inside the Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s chassis to vent out any heat ejected from the chipset while gaming. The fan is automatically activated while running games or charging, so the phone never appears to heat up much.\n\nDriving the phone is an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is paired to 12GB of RAM on my unit. On top of that, a striking 6.8-inch AMOLED display with an under-display selfie camera and a nearly bezel-less outlook makes it one of the finest and most attractive pieces of mobile hardware from 2024.\n\nWith these features and specifications, the Redmagic 9S Pro is grossly underutilized by being limited to Android games. I say this because while Android phones \u2014 or phones, in general \u2014 have adopted key hardware components from PCs, the software has yet to match the same finesse as desktop environments. And while there are methods to force-fit mobile devices into PC setups, the endeavor requires efforts that not everyone is willing to make.\n\nThis is where the Redmagic 9S Pro comes into play, with its specialized modes to activate a gaming console-like environment without any special hackery. This is accomplished with a mix of software features and external controls that the phone offers.\n\nA special button for a special mode\n\nBesides the circular power button on the right side of the Redmagic 9S Pro lies a two-way slider switch with slopey accents and metallic red color. Flicking the switch upward activates a special mode on the phone called \u201cGame Space.\u201d When you turn on Game Space, the screen rotates horizontally as the phone enters a distinct interface.\n\nThe games installed on the Redmagic 9S Pro are listed in the \u201cGame Lobby\u201d as large tiles that can be stacked in a list or snapped to a grid. Tapping each tile or card shows when the game was installed and the total number of hours you have spent playing the specific game. The space also lets you access one-touch controls to toggle audio and fan on or off along with different controls to change the view of the interface.\n\nWith the red switch slotted upward, the phone is restricted to the game space, and you can\u2019t use it normally. But this interface is not where the Redmagic 9S Pro really stands out. The features, although less nuanced, can also be seen in the form of game modes for other devices.\n\nInstead, the 9S Pro offers a rather unique experience when you project the phone onto a bigger display.\n\nGaming on a big screen\n\nThis Redmagic gaming phone\u2019s true superpower lies in its desktop mode. While other phone brands emphasize a desktop environment for work \u2014 as Samsung does with its Linux-like DeX interface \u2014 the 9S Pro favor a gaming-oriented setup that appears particularly inspired by a console.\n\nThere are two ways to utilize this specialized mode: by connecting to a display either with a wired connection or wireless. In both methods, you can either directly cast the contents of the phone\u2019s screen onto a larger display or extend like you would with a computer or laptop, so you can continue interacting with your phone while also viewing the Game Space being cast to an external display.\n\nWith the wireless mode, you start by searching for a wireless display \u2014 one that supports Miracast or Chromecast \u2014 on the Redmagic 9S Pro.\n\nThe wireless casting functionality is native to Android, which means the phone\u2019s screen is simply duplicated on the larger display. A setup like that isn\u2019t exactly beneficial, especially while gaming, since you would need to look at the phone to ensure you are hitting the right buttons. So, Redmagic takes a different approach to remedy that issue.\n\nIn the extended screen mode, you see a display like the one seen below. The screen turns into a wireless touchpad that you can use to interact with the interface.\n\nNext, when you cast the phone wirelessly onto a bigger screen, the phone\u2019s screen can be turned into a large virtual gamepad. On the left of this gamepad, there\u2019s a direction pad and on the right, a set of ABXY buttons. Two joysticks for right and left are overlaid with these sets of buttons. This layout appears as an overlay on top of the actual game\u2019s interface.\n\nThe overlay can be hidden, so it\u2019s easier to navigate through the maze of convoluted menus on mobile games, and resurfaced when you are ready to dive into action. This is even useful for games that don\u2019t inherently support gamepads, as the keys can be remapped over existing buttons.\n\nThe overlay buttons are massive and fairly responsive, and I could get used to them with barely any practice or peeling my eyes away from the TV. With this setup, I thoroughly enjoyed games such as Call of Duty: Mobile, especially since I could continue using the capacitive triggers that I had mapped for shooting.\n\nWith the unfair, pleasantly unethical, advantage that a large 50-inch TV added for me, I scored some of the best kill-to-death ratios in deathmatches and constantly emerged as the MVP in the majority of the games. The bigger graphics and the brighter colors of the TV also make it much easier to scan for enemies across the landscape.\n\nAdding to the experience was the fact the Redmagic 9S Pro transmitted the visuals at up to 120 frames per second (fps) with low graphics and 60 fps with \u201cUltra\u201d video quality. Even though this is practically a mobile game upscaled to a massive display, the finer nuances are nearly undetectable from just a few feet away. More importantly, there is barely any latency on wireless connections even when my router sits in a different room.\n\nWhere wired connection rules\n\nWith wired connections \u2014 either through HDMI or DisplayPort, the Redmagic 9S Pro automatically connects in the most appropriate setting, and you don\u2019t need to manually toggle between duplicating the screen or extending it. With the red Game Space switch set to its off position, the screen is simply duplicated just as it is for any other phone that supports video out over its USB port. But when the switched is flicked on, the external display shows its console-like interface while the phone\u2019s display becomes a touchpad.\n\nThe cast display adjusts to the size and resolution of the second screen, eliminating any letterboxing or empty bars around the display.\n\nHowever, with the phone hooked to a display using a wire, using it to control the larger screen can feel cumbersome and jarring. Thankfully, there are a few ways around it. First, you can connect a keyboard and a mouse to operate the console-like ecosystem. Redmagic even gives you tools like key-mapping software that you can use to assign various keyboard and mouse buttons to each game separately. While it would be slightly easier if there were presets for games, you have to configure the control manually.\n\nNonetheless, you still get the advantage of using a keyboard and mouse for games that could benefit from the extra physical keys. More importantly, since the keyboard and mouse connected via this method are not detected in games like PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty: Mobile, you are not paired with other players using emulators or similar setups for first-person shooter gaming.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of ports, I use a . I relay an HDMI cable out of the hub and connect a wired mouse and keyboard through the USB ports. And to make sure I don\u2019t run out of power while gaming on a large screen, I connect a charger using the hub\u2019s USB-C port.\n\nI chose this hub over any other because it comes with a screen on top, which means I can see charging speeds and get a sense of the screen resolution via HDMI. Thanks to this tiny screen, I know the Redmagic 9S Pro projects to my 4K monitor at full 4K resolution at 60Hz.\n\nWhile getting higher refresh rates could be a challenge over HDMI 2.0 (since most USB hubs without Thunderbolt don\u2019t support HDMI 2.1 or newer standards), you can still use a USB-to-DisplayPort cable to relay contents at 4K resolution and up to 120Hz refresh rate. The onboard Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\u2019s GPU can handle the demand for this high-resolution output over the USB port. At the same time, the fan helps maintain a steadily convenient temperature inside the phone despite the load.\n\nA wired setup involving a mouse and keyboard is especially great if you like to game while sitting at a desk. But like I said at the beginning of the article, my objective this winter is to hole up in my sofa for as long as I can. So, I turned to a Bluetooth controller that lets me play games and control the phone\u2019s interface from a distance.\n\nFor this task, I picked up the , one of the most versatile gaming controllers. Although the extendable section is designed to keep the phone \u2014 or a Nintendo Switch \u2014 in between the two sides of the gamepad, Bluetooth connectivity means it works seamlessly even without a device tucked in those claws. Each of the grips features an individual vibration motor for rumble, and the trigger buttons have hall effect switches, similar to a PlayStation 5\u2019s controllers, for a precise level of pressing, which can be especially useful for controlling throttle in racing games.\n\nThe primary reason I chose this controller is that it can connect to a device in four different modes. In wireless connections, it can emulate a regular Android gamepad but can also replicate a PlayStation DualShock controller and Nintendo Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons. In wired mode, it can work as an Xbox controller. Based on the game I run \u2014 and whether it supports an Android gamepad or not \u2014 I can choose the mode to run.\n\nFor instance, since Call of Duty has native support for PS DualShock controllers, I was simply to slot the GameSir into the DS mode and use it native key mapping without any hackery. However, for games such as Mech Arena or Genshin Impact that do not support controllers (at least on Android), GameSir\u2019s app can also be used to map custom controls over practically any game.\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro, hooked to my 50-inch QLED TV and connected wirelessly to the GameSir controller, makes the ideal setup for me to enjoy a plethora of games without actually having to get up from my cozy spot.\n\nA similar setup can be achieved using a wireless connection, with two wireless devices in a signal chain \u2014 the controller and the wireless display. You might witness some latency, though, which may not be favorable for competitive games. But at the same time, having the phone handy also means you can control the interface almost immediately, especially if the controller you are using does not have a touchpad built in.\n\nI spent countless hours trying to nail the same level of dexterity on Call of Duty: Mobile as with the virtual joystick above, but jamming physical buttons and joysticks feels like a more satisfying experience than tapping a screen. It might be a different case with you, but the Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s flexibility allows plenty of room for adjustment for all measures.\n\nBesides Call of Duty, I extensively played Shadow Fight 4 (comparable to Street Fighter), especially since it offers native controller support. Similarly, Farlight 84, a lighthearted battle royale that looks like Fortnite and Apex Legends had a baby, is another title I thoroughly enjoyed thanks to this setup.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where I settled. Of course, Android allows all sorts of emulation tools to run classic Nintendo, PlayStation, PSP, or even older Windows games. So I installed Dolphin Emulator, PPSSPP Emulator, and Winlator, snagged a few free ROMs off the internet, and ran a bunch of my favorite games from my childhood and teenage years, such as Need For Speed: Most Wanted, successfully rotting on my couch for the entirety of the Christmas break.\n\nAll this happened while I barely experienced any glitches in the gameplay with these emulators and got stable frame rates, thanks to the constantly running fan at the back. Redmagic also allows connecting to a laptop or Windows PC and running Android games while you utilize the connected peripherals, but that\u2019s not the utility I\u2019m going after.\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro is oddly satisfying\n\nOver the time I have spent with the Redmagic 9S Pro, I have had an unwavering opinion that there is no phone like it. Perhaps the ones that are are from the same brand. After a slight learning curve, I thoroughly enjoyed gaming on the Redmagic 9S Pro and especially cherished times when I spent playing games on the larger display. If you tap into the world of emulators, there\u2019s hardly a chance you will emerge from it without spending a few days just wheeling in nostalgia.\n\nEven without the casting features, the Redmagic 9S Pro is commendable as a gaming phone. Besides a souped-up flagship Snapdragon processor, the dedicated cooling fan and the trigger button give you such an advantage over competitors. Meanwhile, the RGB lighting sets the right mood for gaming.\n\nMost importantly, for the hardware it brings, the 9S Pro has an unbeatable price. For , you get the unlocked version that also includes an 80W fast charger. If you were to spend $250 more, you could get a newer generation of gaming phone from Redmagic with a Snapdragon 8 Elite instead and 16GB of RAM, though that might be overkill. The 9S Pro, on the other hand, brings unmatched value and can be just as good as a primary phone as it will be as a secondary phone specifically for gaming \u2014 all depending on your budget. Either way, you will be blown away."

            "article_content": "A recent article in the journal Nature described the new Google-backed artificial intelligence tool GenCast, which can significantly outperform conventional weather forecasting \u2014 with implications for saving money and lives by improving preparations for extreme weather.\n\nAnnounced in early December, GenCast is a machine-learning model that boasts \"better forecasts of both day-to-day weather and extreme events\" than existing systems.\n\nThe technology, developed by the Google-owned company DeepMind, based in London, improves forecasting accuracy for up to 15 days into the future \u2014 a time frame that traditional models have found problematic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a big deal,\" Kerry Emanuel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor emeritus, told The New York Times.\n\nThe newspaper explained that Emanuel and colleagues argued in 2019 that extending the time for reliable forecasts from 10 days to 15 days could help people avoid the worst of extreme weather and reap \"enormous socioeconomic benefits.\"\n\nAs the Times detailed, the \"chaotic nature of Earth's atmosphere\" has historically put limits on how far into the future forecasters can peer accurately. GenCast achieved higher accuracy in tests using historical data against a current standard-bearer, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\n\nAccording to the Times, the new model also \"ran circles\" around its DeepMind predecessor, released in late 2023. \"It's like we've made decades worth of improvements in one year,\" R\u00e9mi Lam, who worked on both models, said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother improvement: GenCast is a \"probabilistic\" model rather than a \"deterministic\" one \u2014 meaning that it gives probabilities for outcomes rather than just yes/no predictions. This is the difference between a forecast with a percent chance of precipitation and a forecast that simply gives a best guess of whether it will rain at a particular time and place.\n\nGenCast can also use smaller computers and produce results faster than conventional forecasting methods. Yet it still relies on traditional meteorology. The new tool uses AI's ability to pick out patterns from data and create something new, but it's anchored by 40 years of real-world data and current-day measurements, the Times reported.\n\nLam pointed out how this makes GenCast's results less susceptible to some fallacies of other AI products that train on the internet's chaos of facts and fictions. \"We have a ground truth,\" Lam told the Times.\n\nAmong other concerns, AI has been criticized for its massive energy needs. This is particularly a problem if the energy comes from sources that release heat-trapping gases that in turn cause planetary warming and amplify extreme weather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeepMind has argued that its application of the technology will help people deal with the consequences of changing weather patterns.\n\n\"Weather impacts all of us,\" GenCast's announcement stated. \"As climate change drives more extreme weather events, accurate and trustworthy forecasts are more essential than ever.\"\n\n\"... Consider tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes and typhoons. Getting better and more advanced warnings of where they'll strike land is invaluable.\"\n\nThe DeepMind researchers highlighted how GenCast could also help the field of clean energy, such as by better predicting the reliability of wind power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith DeepMind opening its models to the public, the world may not need to wait long for it to have influence.\n\nForecasters are interested in using the model. Matthew Chantry, a machine learning coordinator at ECMWF, told the Times that his center was already incorporating aspects of the tech.\n\n\"We are eager to engage with the wider weather community,\" two of DeepMind's lead researchers wrote in their blog. They acknowledged that such collaborations \"are critical to our mission to apply our models to benefit humanity.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "When I was planning my reporting trip to Africa this past June, I knew I wanted to visit Bamenda, Cameroon. I\u2019d heard about an archdiocesan-wide push to have an adoration chapel in every parish and had been impressed with the local leader, Archbishop Andrew Nkea.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, at least not until just weeks before my visit, was that I would be walking into a literal warzone.\n\nBamenda is in the epicenter of the Cameroonian Civil War, which pits English-speaking separatists against the Francophone-dominated government. Since 2017, the conflict has killed roughly 8,000 people.\n\nLearning about the war definitely gave me second thoughts about visiting Bamenda. At the same time, it also put the archdiocese\u2019s push for Eucharistic adoration in a new, more dramatic light. And in the end, my conviction that this story needed to be told won out.\n\nThe daylong visit to Bamenda had its share of hair-raising moments, including an episode where our jeep got stuck on a muddy backstreet \u2014 even my host, a local monsignor, said he was scared in that moment.\n\nBut by God\u2019s grace, I left Bamenda unharmed and with many powerful encounters with local Catholics. I hope that my story\u2019s portrayal of their complete and total reliance upon the Lord in the midst of the ongoing conflict will inspire other Catholics to renew their own Eucharistic devotion \u2014 because I know it inspired me."

In doing so, China also incentivises these countries to reduce their ties with India read more\n\nThe Third China-Indian Ocean Region Forum on Blue Economy Development Cooperation was held from December 15 to 17 in Kunming. Apart from the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), the principal organiser, it is notable that Barbados and the Maldives co-hosted the forum alongside China. The forum, themed \u201cFuture of the Blue Indian Ocean\u2014Development Practice of the Global South,\u201d featured, for the first time, a dialogue between governments and enterprises. Representatives from Chinese and international governments, as well as companies, discussed multi-stakeholder engagement in international development cooperation, paving the way for broader international collaboration by involving multiple stakeholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZhao Fengtao, Deputy Director of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), said, \u201cNext, we are willing to deepen opening-up and cooperation with other countries to jointly create a \u2019new engine\u2019 for the blue economy. We will consolidate consensus on sustainable marine development to build a \u2019new space\u2019 for blue development. Maritime dialogue and consultations will be strengthened to seek a \u2019new model\u2019 for blue governance. We will also promote mutual learning among maritime cultures with other countries to create a \u2019new chapter\u2019 of maritime civilisation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Wang Yong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, mentioned that the \u201cconstruction of a maritime community with a shared future\u201d is evolving from a Chinese initiative into a shared international goal. China aims to enhance partnerships in maritime transport, biomedicine, renewable energy, infrastructure, and marine science and technology, Wang added.\n\nAt the third forum, a \u2018Global Development Project Pool Information Management System\u2019 was launched, along with the inauguration of the \u2018China-Indian Ocean Region Centre for Maritime Cooperation and Training Centre\u2019. Agreements were signed for the creation of a low-carbon demonstration zone in Seychelles and the development of projects for early warning and response to climate-induced disasters in Pakistan and the Maldives.\n\nAccording to CIDCA, which organised the event, \u201cChina has established normalised cooperation mechanisms with 17 Indian Ocean region countries, and cooperation is being carried out in fields including remote sensing, maritime monitoring and research, biodiversity, and disaster reduction.\u201d The forum prominently featured topics such as ocean-based infrastructure, digital empowerment for the blue economy, cultural exchange for marine tourism, automated port projects, automated warehouses, and distribution centres. Additionally, Chu Yili from China Communications Construction Company Ltd highlighted opportunities for joint development in marine new energy and deep-sea resource exploration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Maritime Community with a Shared Future\u2019 represents China\u2019s broad vision for ocean-based economic development, through which it seeks to lead global oceanic and fisheries governance. Under this vision of a \u2018shared future\u2019, China aims to establish diverse mechanisms with a heightened focus on multi-tiered ocean governance in the Indian Ocean Region. To achieve these objectives, China advocates for maritime peace, joint governance of oceans, cooperation in fisheries management, support for marine technologies, and the development of information-sharing mechanisms.\n\nIt is worth recalling the deliverables outlined in the joint statement at the second China-Indian Ocean Region Forum on Development Cooperation (2023). These include establishing the China-Indian Ocean Region Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Alliance; building and initiating the China-Indian Ocean Region Blue Economy Think Tank Network; inaugurating the China-Africa Cooperation Centre on Satellite Remote Sensing Application in Beijing (July 2023); launching the Blue Talent Program; and proposing a New Energy Indian Ocean Initiative, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe China-Africa Cooperation Centre on Satellite Remote Sensing Application stands out as a significant initiative, with clear potential for expansion in the coming years. Notably, China has launched the first satellites for its \u2018GuoWang\u2019 mega constellation (GuoWang meaning \u201cnational network\u201d), intensifying the race for space-based broadband internet services both domestically and internationally. The project is managed by China Satellite Network Group Co. Ltd., a state-owned enterprise established in 2021 under the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet.\n\nThe newly launched satellites mark the first batch of the GuoWang broadband mega constellation in low Earth orbit (LEO), which is planned to consist of nearly 13,000 spacecraft upon completion. Additionally, another Chinese broadband mega constellation, Qianfan (\u201cThousand Sails\u201d), is also under development. Qianfan is expected to feature a similar scale, and to date, 54 Qianfan spacecraft have been launched across three missions conducted this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) is particularly well-suited for all types of remote sensing, ranging from high-resolution Earth observation to scientific research. Thanks to technological advancements, various types of remote sensing satellites can operate in one of three orbits: polar, non-polar Low Earth Orbit (LEO), or Geostationary Orbit (GEO). The high number of satellites planned by Beijing allows for complete global coverage.\n\nUnderstanding China\u2019s Civil-Military Fusion (CMF) policy is key to recognising that advancements in LEO connectivity have not only enhanced civilian applications but have also triggered a paradigm shift in military communications. Orbiting at lower altitudes, LEO satellites offer low latency, enabling near-instantaneous connectivity for troops. This capability is a game-changer for personnel in the field, at sea, or even in the air, allowing them to make video calls, access critical data, and engage in seamless communication with minimal delay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina\u2019s approach to the \u2018blue economy\u2019 reflects a convergence of geopolitical, economic, ecological, technological, and legal perspectives, presenting emerging challenges for global ocean governance. These challenges arise from China\u2019s integration of the blue economy development concept with its Maritime Silk Road initiative, through which it seeks to shape governance rules to align with its strategic interests. China views the ocean as an integral part of its maritime economy, positioning it as a driver of innovation to advance its goal of becoming a great maritime power. This vision aligns with the broader objectives of the Chinese Dream and national rejuvenation.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping, China aims to enhance maritime trade with the rest of the world, ensure food and energy security, and increase Chinese investments in port and ocean economy-related infrastructure globally. This culminated in the announcement of Beijing\u2019s Vision for Maritime Cooperation in 2017. Since then, China\u2019s Blue Economy concept has evolved into a core component of Beijing\u2019s broader strategy to become a \u201cglobal maritime great power\u201d.\n\nThese efforts give China\u2019s approach a global dimension and connect it to a broader Chinese discourse, linking outward-facing policies such as its claim of being a \u201cnear-Arctic state\u201d in its Arctic policy. It also extends the One Belt and One Road Initiative (BRI) to include projects like the Health Silk Road, Space Silk Road, Arctic Silk Road, and Digital Silk Road, among others. Such discourses have reinforced China\u2019s hardened positions in its maritime disputes with neighbouring countries in the South China Sea, including the Philippines, Vietnam, and others, positions that are widely regarded as unfounded and illegal.\n\nNext, areas like cultural exchange and maritime tourism, though prominently discussed, need to be approached with caution. They create favourable conditions for China to exert influence and strategically position itself. This can lead to a more dominant Chinese presence and may pressure the respective governments to approve Beijing-initiated infrastructure plans with minimal resistance. In return, this facilitates China\u2019s efforts to consolidate the presence of its companies in these regions.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of State Security (Guoanbu) has consistently prioritised cultural soft power and people-to-people exchanges to maintain open channels of communication. In the past, it has devised plans to engage foreign personalities from academic, think tank, and cultural sectors to promote a vision of a benign China\u2014one that poses no threat and positions itself solely as a development partner, aligning with the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). China\u2019s efforts to develop new forms of ties, such as cultural diplomacy, should also be viewed through the lens of the United Front Work Department\u2019s involvement. This CCP organ, known for its overseas influence operations, often operates under the guise of diplomatic channels.\n\nInitiatives like the China-Indian Ocean Region Forum and the China-South Asia Cooperation Forum (CSACF) are part of Beijing\u2019s soft power approach beyond military engagement, focusing on civil-diplomatic efforts to achieve preferred outcomes. Both of these initiatives exclude India, and China uses tools such as aid, capacity building, and advancements in science, technology, and innovation to strengthen its connections with countries in the Indo-Pacific and deepen its influence. In doing so, China also incentivises these countries to reduce their ties with India.\n\nChina relies on a safe, secure, and stable Indian Ocean to achieve its foreign policy and domestic objectives. Its interest in the region is clear, and the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to China will only continue to grow. This can be seen as part of a new role that Beijing seeks to play in the IOR. These international activities and aspirations are expected to expand in the future.\n\nThe writer is the Head of Strategic Studies Programme at the Centre for National Security Studies (CNSS), Bengaluru.

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nGraphics are a huge part of the PC gaming experience. Unfortunately, not every computer is built for the best games on the market. Laptops and pre-built PCs don't always ship with the best possible specs. And if you built your computer, it can be very expensive to update the internal components.\n\nIf you want to play the latest and greatest games, but aren't sure if your PC can handle them, you'll need to know what graphics card you have installed. Once you have this information, you can then compare it to the minimum requirements for the game you want to play. Here's how to figure it out.\n\nOur Top-Rated Graphics Cards\n\nWhat's a Graphics Card?\n\nWhen you turn on your computer, the images that appear on the screen\u2014whether it's a simple Word document or a complex 4K gaming experience\u2014are generated by a graphics processing unit (or GPU). These chips can range from simple \"integrated graphics,\" which are part of the motherboard or processor, to larger, more powerful expansion cards that have their own fan system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese cards\u2014often called \"discrete\" or \"dedicated\" graphics cards\u2014can usually perform more powerful tasks than integrated graphics, like better 3D gaming, accelerated video rendering, or even certain non-graphical jobs like mining Bitcoin. This extra utility comes at the expense of higher power usage, increased heat, and more space in your computer, which is why you won't find dedicated graphics cards in ultra-thin laptops.\n\nThere are two main components of a graphics card: the chip that does the work, and the card (which includes other hardware like the cooler, voltage regulation module, and so on). There are two main chip manufacturers today: Nvidia and AMD (though Intel's Arc line has also hit the market). There are many card manufacturers\u2014Asus, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte\u2014that use these chips, adding their own tweaks to set themselves apart. One manufacturer's version may have better fans, can come overclocked, or have a better warranty.\n\nKnowing what graphics card you have can be confusing, since the chip itself has its own model number that's separate from the card's model number. So when you're looking up what graphics card you have, you'll need to decide whether knowing the chipset is enough (for example, the \"Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060\") or whether you need the actual manufacturer and model of the card (such as the \"EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 Superclocked,\" which uses Nvidia's chipset). The former is very easy to find in Windows, while the latter is a bit more complicated.\n\nJust like any other computer component, graphics cards can become outdated over time. The card you bought in 2015 is unlikely to play 2025's AAA games at high settings, so if you're ever unsure whether a game like Elden Ring will run on your PC, you'll want to compare its minimum or recommended requirements to the hardware you currently have.\n\nFind Out What GPU You Have in Windows\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out what graphics card you have from the Windows Device Manager. Type \"Device Manager\" into the Start menu and press Enter to launch the Control Panel. Click the drop-down arrow next to Display adapters, and it should list your GPU. If you aren't sure which company designed the chip, right-click on it and choose Properties to see the manufacturer\u2014AMD, in my case. (Note that Device Manager uses your graphics drivers to determine what GPU you have, so if you suspect the wrong drivers may be installed, skip to the next section.)\n\nOnce you have the GPU name, you can compare it to the minimum requirements on the game you want to play. Usually, a higher number denotes a better card\u2014so a game that requires an RX 580 may not run well on an RX 480, which is less powerful (though there are sometimes ways around that). If you're comparing two cards that use different naming schemes\u2014like AMD's RX 580 and the more powerful RX Vega 56\u2014you may have to do a little research to see which card is more powerful. Information like release year and price can usually give you the answer.\n\nFind the Manufacturer and Model Number\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to know exactly what model video card you have, you'll have to do a bit more work. The manufacturer is easy enough to find with a third-party app called Speccy. Download the free version, start it up, and click the Graphics option in the sidebar. Scroll down and look for the Subvendor entry, which should tell you who made the card in your PC. (You'll also be able to see how much video RAM your card has, among other specs.)\n\nUnfortunately, this won't tell you the exact model number, which you'll need for, say, warranty claims or tech support. (Asus makes a few different RX 580 cards, and they'll need the exact model number to help.) For that, you'll need to search your email for the receipt (if you bought the card online). Otherwise, you'll need to open the PC up. In this case, find the graphics card, remove it, and look at the sticker on the side\u2014it should have the model number you need.\n\nMake sure to write this information down somewhere so you don't need to crack your PC open next time\u2014you never know when you might need it!"

            "article_content": "Krishna specializes in designing and implementing hybrid cloud architectures for highly regulated sectors, such as the healthcare industry.\n\nGopi Krishna\n\nIntegration design becomes a key component of innovation in the fast-paced field of information technology, where systems need to communicate with each other and data flows need to be optimized. Through this discipline, organizations can solve complex problems, improve operational efficiency, and satisfy constantly changing business demands by bridging the gap between disparate systems. A strategic enabler that propels innovation by coordinating technological solutions with organizational objectives, integration architecture is more than just a technical framework. For Gopi Krishna, a specialist in cloud architectures and middleware solutions, this field offers a special nexus of strategic vision and technical precision. Krishna has a career that includes notable accomplishments in sectors like healthcare and logistics. His journey highlights the transformative power of careful integration architecture in resolving challenging IT issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKrishna specializes in designing and implementing hybrid cloud architectures for highly regulated sectors, such as the healthcare industry. The two requirements of cost-effectiveness and compliance in this field demand solutions that strike a balance between strict data security and operational scalability. This equilibrium is best demonstrated by Krishna's work, especially in the way he incorporates cutting-edge encryption techniques, safe access controls, and compliance with laws like HIPAA. By taking these precautions, sensitive medical data was protected, and the solutions were scalable to accommodate future organizational requirements.\n\nIn the same way, his contributions to the logistics industry emphasize how important integration architecture is to supply chain optimization. Through the integration of cloud platforms and on-premise systems, Krishna created robust infrastructures that improved the accessibility of real-time data. The effectiveness of order processing and delivery systems was greatly increased by this work, illustrating the direct influence that strong middleware solutions can have on organizational performance.\n\nThe progression of Krishna's career from engineer to middleware architect highlights his dedication to lifelong learning and flexibility. Having earned certifications from AWS and Oracle, he has continuously kept up with the latest developments in technology. Projects like improving the backbone for telecom operators, redesigning the middleware architecture of TelePacific Systems, and developing a unified IT platform for the City of Tshwane in South Africa are just a few examples of his technical proficiency. Krishna's ability to use creative IT solutions to address intricate, systemic inefficiencies is demonstrated by the latter, a massive project to digitize and integrate government operations.\n\nIn his current role, Krishna has produced quantifiable effects at the organizational level. For example, his efforts in internal application security have doubled the system's order handling capacity, resulting in 50% shorter processing times and a 100% increase in transaction rates. Improved service delivery and cost savings are directly correlated with this efficiency. Likewise, his hybrid cloud designs for medical devices guaranteed adherence to international regulatory standards while protecting against data breaches.\n\nHowever, Krishna's career has been fraught with difficulties. For example, integrating legacy systems with contemporary platforms necessitated creative approaches to data processing and security. He maintained their relevance in an age of rapid technological advancement by ensuring smooth communication across disparate systems through the use of tools like RESTful services and API gateways.\n\nThe significance of proactive planning and resilience in IT architecture is highlighted by Krishna's predictions about future trends. He promotes integrating modern technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational dependability and security. Moreover, his emphasis on continuous training for IT professionals reflects his recognition of the dynamic nature of security threats and compliance requirements.\n\nReflecting on his experience, Krishna asserts, \u201cIn IT architecture, the key to solving tomorrow\u2019s challenges lies in anticipating them today. Innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies but designing systems that are secure, adaptable, and prepared for the unexpected. This idea acts as a compass for businesses attempting to negotiate the intricacies of integration architecture in a digital environment that is changing quickly.\n\nKrishna has shown through his work that innovation and successfully tackling IT challenges depend heavily on careful design and strategic foresight. As industries continue to change, experts like him establish the benchmark for excellence in integration architecture, helping businesses to accomplish their strategic and operational goals."

            "article_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is preparing to dust off a series of centuries-old laws and legal theories to drive his first-year agenda \u2014 particularly on the border and birthright citizenship \u2014 hoping history will be on his side when the inevitable legal challenges make their way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe incoming president has said he intends to use an obscure 1798 law with a sordid backstory to speed deportations and has hinted at the possibility of invoking a separate law with roots in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 to deploy the military on American soil.\n\nImmigration isn\u2019t the only policy in play: Some of his allies, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, have advocated for enforcing an 1873 chastity law that could bar sending abortion drugs through the mail.\n\nTrump has framed the laws as harking back to a more muscular time in American politics, suggesting he may use the powers signed into law by Presidents John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and others to confront the \u201cenemy from within\u201d and carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThink of that: We had to go back to 1798,\u201d Trump told a conservative gathering in Georgia days before the November election. \u201cThat\u2019s when we had laws that were effective.\u201d\n\nBut at least some of the authorities Trump is preparing to claim have fraught histories \u2014 and their invocation will queue up confrontations with an unpopular 6-3 conservative Supreme Court that is being closely watched for its appetite to act as a guardrail on the new administration.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s style is \u2018Don\u2019t get in my way,\u2019\u201d said William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and expert on the Insurrection Act.\n\nThe 1807 law, Banks said gives the president \u201cenough discretion that he could drive a truck through\u201d its requirements to deploy the military at home, such as for immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe act allows him to do a lot on his own,\u201d Banks added, \u201cwith very few procedural hurdles.\u201d\n\n\u2018In those days, we didn\u2019t play\u2019\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump specifically vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to \u201ctarget and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.\u201d The law allows the federal government to expedite deportations of citizens of a \u201chostile nation\u201d in times of war or when an enemy attempts an \u201cinvasion or predatory incursion\u201d into the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is how far we had to go back, because in those days, we didn\u2019t play games,\u201d Trump said at a rally in November.\n\nThe notion that migrants entering the US represents an \u201cinvasion\u201d has gained currency among some legal conservatives, particularly in the context of birthright citizenship \u2014 another historic principle Trump has promised to topple. But experts say the incoming president will face an uphill fight defending the law in court, in part because of the history of how it has been used.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act was last used during World War II to imprison Japanese nationals and others, a precursor to the internment of US citizens of Japanese descent (which the Supreme Court upheld in a controversial 1944 decision).\n\nThe act, \u201cby its history, is very clearly a wartime authority and so to have a president use this authority outside of wartime would be a clear abuse,\u201d said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program who has written extensively about the law.\n\nBut Ebright and others have warned it\u2019s not clear if courts would step in stop Trump from using it during peacetime.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court last considered the Alien Enemies Act, in 1948, it gave President Harry Truman broad deference to decide when the law could be invoked. Truman had sought to remove a German national and the appeal arrived at the Supreme Court three years after the end of World War II.\n\nWar, the court reasoned at that time, isn\u2019t necessarily over \u201cwhen the shooting stops.\u201d\n\nThe 1873 chastity law\n\nSome conservatives remain hopeful that Trump\u2019s incoming administration will enforce an 1873 law that bans the sending of \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d materials through the mail. Decried by critics as a \u201czombie law,\u201d the Comstock Act is viewed by anti-abortion advocates as a tool that could be used to prohibit the mailing of abortion drugs.\n\nMedication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US.\n\nTrump told CBS News in August that he would \u2014 \u201cgenerally speaking\u201d \u2014 not use the act to ban the mailing of abortion drugs. And yet there will likely be pressure on his Justice Department to undermine the Biden administration\u2019s position on the issue. Biden\u2019s DOJ issued an internal memo in 2022 finding that the Comstock Act doesn\u2019t bar mailing abortion drugs when the recipient lacks the intent to \u201cuse them unlawfully.\u201d\n\nTrump told NBC in early December that he \u201cprobably\u201d would not attempt to restrict access to abortion medication but said that \u201cthings do change.\u201d\n\nVance, then a Republican senator from Ohio, was one of several Republicans who signed a letter that described that memo as \u201cdisappointing\u201d and called for it to be \u201cimmediately rescinded,\u201d according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe Supreme Court dodged the issue in a related opinion in June that dealt with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s decades-old approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. But it was clear during the oral arguments in that case in March that at least two conservatives \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2014 were interested in the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is a prominent provision,\u201d Alito said. \u201cIt\u2019s not some obscure subsection of a complicated obscure law.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The unknown story of this historic photo 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nMilitary for deportations?\n\nTrump has repeatedly flirted with using the military for domestic purposes, including during his first term. In an interview earlier this year with Time magazine, he discussed using the military or National Guard to help with the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nBecause federal armed forces are generally barred from civilian law enforcement, Trump would likely have to rely on the Insurrection Act to carry out such a policy.\n\nThe current version of the act was last invoked by President George H.W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the acquittal of four White police officers in the beating of Rodney King.\n\nThe general prohibition on using the military domestically \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country,\u201d Trump told Time in another interview after the election. \u201cWe\u2019ll go as far as I\u2019m allowed to go, according to the laws of our country.\u201d\n\nThe best-known use of the Insurrection Act was in 1957, when President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to integrate its schools. That order followed the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision three years earlier in Brown v. Board of Education that declared segregated schools unconstitutional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has generally deferred to the president\u2019s judgment to invoke the law.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much of a historical set of precedents to interpret laws like the Insurrection Act,\u201d Banks said. \u201cAnd the reason, ironically, is that the courts have given such a wide berth to the president to make the call about when it\u2019s and when it\u2019s not necessary to use the military.\u201d\n\nRelitigating birthright citizenship\n\nTrump is also keen to reopen an old fight over birthright citizenship, which has been settled law since the Supreme Court ruled in 1898 that people born on US soil are citizens, even if their parents are not.\n\nThe president-elect has long railed against birthright citizenship, which is protected under the 14th Amendment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stands near a portrait of George Washington at a Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride event in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, April 18, 2019, in Washington. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nStill, his allies are considering directing the State Department to deny passports to children with undocumented parents and tighten requirements for tourist visas to crack down on \u201cbirth tourism,\u201d sources familiar with the planning told CNN in December. Denying passports to people born in the United States would trigger immediate lawsuits.\n\nTrump last year described long-held protections for people born in the country as being \u201cbased on a historical myth, and a willful misinterpretation of the law.\u201d\n\nBut legal experts on both ends of the political spectrum believe history would work against Trump.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court sticks to its \u2018history and tradition\u2019 approach, it will not uphold an executive order denying birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized aliens,\u201d said Rogers Smith, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThere\u2019s no history or tradition supporting such an executive action, and there\u2019s a long history and tradition of recognizing such children as birthright citizens.\u201d"

He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

Credit: H. Christoph / ullstein bild / contributor via Getty Images\n\nAfter calls with foreign leaders, rap sessions with lawmakers, and long classified briefings with advisers, President Jimmy Carter would often escape to the roof of the White House.\n\nThere his son Jeffrey had set up a tracking telescope, Carter said in his book, A Full Life. Feeling the weight of the world, he would gaze at the stars and contemplate his place among them.\n\n\"I recall one winter night going to the White House roof to study the Orion nebulae, but we could barely see the stars, their images so paled by city lights,\" he waxed in a poem.\n\nThat particular evening, on Dec. 18, 1977, the astrophysicist Carl Sagan joined him. They had just visited the U.S. Naval Observatory next to the vice president\u2019s mansion, where they discussed all things space \u2014 planets , stars, black holes , and astrobiology . Carter himself was a man of science: He studied engineering in college and did graduate work in nuclear physics .\n\n\"It was a welcome diversion from earthly concerns,\" he wrote in a thank-you note to Sagan.\n\nCarter, who died on Dec. 29, 2024 at 100, was an avid astronomer, with a profound curiosity for the cosmos, a part of his story that isn't well-known. It began when he was a lab assistant to an astronomy teacher his freshman year in college, and it continued as he learned celestial navigation in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. One Christmas while on a ship with his family, he asked the captain if the crew had a sextant on board, a tool for measuring the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky. The captain proceeded to show him one, he said , displayed like a museum artifact in a glass case.\n\nBut politics often eclipsed the former president's appreciation for space. Though his first budget funded the program that became NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope, Carter was maligned for not supporting human spaceflight in the vein of the Apollo program, said Steven Hochman, former special assistant to the president at the Carter Center. He was a supporter of robotic exploration and research that could benefit people's lives, but when it came to the exorbitant cost of sending astronauts into deep space , he preferred spending on domestic concerns.\n\n\"NASA, I believe, has not given him the credit he deserves,\" Hochman told Mashable. \"I believe it is because he was critical of the Space Shuttle program and didn't provide funding for future missions to the moon or Mars.\"\n\nFor years political adversaries ridiculed Carter for having a tinfoil hat, stemming from an incident in 1969 that later circulated in the press. After a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a few other men spotted something strange moving in the sky: a luminous object, first blue then red, the apparent size and brightness of the moon . About four years later, Carter reported the unidentified flying object to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter places the Congressional Space Medal around NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong's neck.

Skeptics, who likely knew nothing of Carter's astronomy background, suggested he had merely seen Venus .\n\n\"It was not Venus,\" Carter said in a 2007 interview on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast.\n\nIn fact, his UFO sighting had taken on such mythic proportions, some had wondered whether it was the reason Carter wanted NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977. Despite a White House request expressing a need to address the general UFO \"public relations problem,\" NASA had, surprisingly, declined.\n\nThe Japanese space agency JAXA's Akatsuki mission, aka Planet-C or Venus Climate Orbiter, studies the planet's atmosphere from orbit with an ultraviolet imager.

Henry, the agency's deputy director of astrophysics during Carter's administration, to write an essay about it more than a decade later. Henry, a semi-retired professor at Johns Hopkins University today, came to no definitive conclusions on why NASA rebuffed the White House. But, in a postscript , Henry said he sent his draft to Carter before publication in 1988.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Credit: NASA\n\nYet buried within Henry's paper was a small window into Carter's passion for astronomy. In November 1977, the president and his son sent a message to NASA headquarters asking to borrow a seven-inch Questar telescope. Given that there were no telescopes at headquarters \u2014 just paper, Henry said \u2014 he tried to hunt one down at another NASA campus.\n\nIt turned out Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, had one.\n\n\"By great luck, a NASA plane was flying from Huntsville to Washington the next day ([Science adviser Frank] Press was emphatic that the President wanted no special flights or other waste of taxpayer dollars),\" Henry wrote.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter sits alone on a bench at Camp David during the Egyptian-Israeli peace talks on Sept. 9, 1978. Credit: White House / CNP / Getty Images\n\nThe NASA official and his wife, Rita Mahon, picked up the Questar at Washington National Airport and promptly took it to the White House. They then unpacked the telescope from a large wooden crate and showed the Carters how to set it up on the Truman balcony overlooking the South Lawn. The night was cloudy, but they trained on the moon.\n\nThe president then proceeded to take the telescope with him to Camp David near Thurmont, Maryland, on Nov. 23, 1977, where he and his family spent Thanksgiving, according to his daily diary . He returned it about a week later.\n\nOne has to wonder if Carter brought a telescope with him again just 10 months later, when he invited Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to join him at the retreat. The renowned talks would result in the Camp David Accords , which later earned the Middle East leaders a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nU.S. President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin share a three-way handshake after signing the Camp David Accords. Credit: Bettmann / Contributor / Getty Images\n\nThere's an amusing irony to the false urban legend that Carter believed he was visited by aliens: He is, after all, the most likely person to make humanity's introduction to extraterrestrials.\n\nSome 15.5 billion miles away from Earth, hurtling through the cold, uncharted abyss, is NASA's Voyager 1 probe. It is the farthest spacecraft from home, having left the solar system in 2012. Soaring through interstellar space at 38,000 mph , it carries a gold-plated record produced by Sagan, with a melange of sounds from the planet.\n\nCrickets. Wind.

These and a letter from Carter are among the recordings on the disk.\n\nA technician puts the golden record on the Voyager spacecraft in a clean room before launch.

Galaxies are spinning away from each other into the infinite unknown. The speed at which space is expanding far outpaces our technology to overcome it. It's as if the universe were contrived to keep its inhabitants apart.\n\nBut should some other intelligent life forms encounter Voyager \u2014 or Voyager 2 , which carries a duplicate record \u2014 thousands or even billions of years into the future, they will discover Carter's words:\n\n\"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings,\" he wrote. \"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nA copy of the statement President Jimmy Carter included on the golden records for the Voyager spacecraft. Credit: NASA\n\nMany knew Carter's intimate relationship with his faith. He grew up Southern Baptist, the son of a farmer in the boomtown of Plains, Georgia. He referred to himself as a born-again Christian. Long after his presidency, he attended regular church services and taught Sunday School .\n\nBut how his evangelical beliefs squared with his thoughts on the universe aren't clear. He wrote in a poem, titled \"Considering the Void:\"\n\nWhen I behold the charm / of evening skies, their lulling endurance; / the patterns of stars with names / of bears and dogs, a swan, a virgin; / other planets that our Voyager showed / were like and so unlike our own, / with all their moons, / bright discs, weird rings, and cratered faces; / comets with their streaming tails / bent by pressure from our sun; / the skyscape of our Milky Way / holding in its shimmering disc /an infinity of suns / (or say a thousand billion); / knowing there are holes of darkness / gulping mass and even light, / knowing that this galaxy of ours / is one of multitudes / in what we call the heavens, / it troubles me. It troubles me.\n\nWhat exactly was haunting Carter? Was he expressing a collision of faith and science in what lies beyond? An existential crisis of never knowing the big picture?\n\nPerhaps, as he wished, humankind will survive this time so that we may live to know more."
