        "article_content": "Tracker brought back Jensen Ackles\u2018 character, Russell, in season 2 \u2014 and the Supernatural Easter eggs followed.\n\nDuring the newest episode, which aired on Sunday, October 20, Justin Hartley\u2018s character, Colter, went missing while looking for a professor who got caught up in UFO research. Colter was subsequently rescued by his older brother, Russell, as they tried to solve the case.\n\nColter and Russell ended up finding the missing man on a military base. Both Shaw brothers were in different trailers on the property when they heard something happening outside that they couldn\u2019t quite explain away.\n\n\u201cI heard it, I felt it and I saw the light,\u201d Russell told Colter. \u201cIt could have been a transporter from another planet that landed 50 yards from us.\u201d\n\nRelated: Most Iconic Guest Stars Featured on Justin Hartley's 'Tracker' Series Justin Hartley\u2018s CBS series Tracker has won over its audience because of the intriguing cases \u2014 and the impressive guest stars. Tracker, which premiered in February 2024, is centered around a survivalist named Colter (Hartley) who travels the country helping people and law enforcement tackle a variety of mysteries. As the series unfolds, viewers learn [\u2026]\n\nThe conversation \u2014 and Russell\u2019s belief in the unknown \u2014 served as a nice nod to Ackles\u2019 role as Dean on The CW\u2019s hit series Supernatural. Before Ackles was cast as Russell, he starred opposite Jared Padalecki on Supernatural from 2005 to 2020. The former costars played brothers who were always on the road hunting monsters.\n\nThroughout Supernatural\u2018s lengthy run on The CW, there was an episode that hinted at aliens. Although it ultimately turned out to be fairies, Tracker throwing the subject matter back to Ackles\u2019 roots offered the nostalgia some fans were looking for with his return to the show.\n\nLater in the episode, Colter got into Russell\u2019s car, which looked like Dean\u2019s iconic Impala. (Some viewers might remember Russell subtly patting an Impala during his debut on Tracker in season 1.)\n\n\u201cThis is a sweet ride, I wouldn\u2019t mind getting behind the wheel of this thing,\u201d Colter told Russell, who replied, \u201cThat is never going to happen.\u201d\n\nRelated: 'Tracker' Season 2 Trailer Shows Justin Hartley, Wife Sofia Pernas' Reunion Fans of Justin Hartley\u2018s hit CBS series Tracker don\u2019t have to wait too long for a second season. The procedural, which is based on Jeffery Deaver\u2018s novel The Never Game, premiered in February after Super Bowl LVIII and immediately found its audience. Viewers were settling in every week to see their favorite fictional survivalist a.k.a [\u2026]\n\nRussell reiterated his love for his car when Colter asked to be driven into the woods. \u201cThis baby doesn\u2019t drive on gravel,\u201d Russell fired back. This mirrored Dean\u2019s behavior on Supernatural when he affectionately referred to his vehicle as \u201cBaby\u201d on the show.\n\nAfter Supernatural came to an end, Ackles, 46, decided to take the car with him.\n\n\u201cAs far as taking something on the final day, I will definitely be taking something that I\u2019ve had my eye on since day one of Supernatural,\u201d he told Digital Spy in September 2020. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK, I\u2019m not stealing it. I got permission. I begged and begged and pleaded for years, but I finally got it this year. They\u2019re going to let me drive home the Impala.\u201d\n\nAckles also revealed he had a clause about the Impala put in his contract. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about that for two years now, and they finally added that to my contract this last season,\u201d he shared on Michael Rosenbaum\u2019s \u201cInside of You\u201d podcast one month later about how Padalecki, 42, was offered the car\u2019s double to take home.\n\nRelated: \u2018Supernatural\u2019 Cast: Where Are They Now? Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles not only formed a close bond with each other while playing brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, respectively, on Supernatural, but they also forged an unbreakable connection with their fans. The actors led the CW drama for 15 seasons from September 2005 to November 2020. The duo were the only cast [\u2026]\n\nWhile the Tracker episode ended with Colter and Russell going their separate ways again, fans can rejoice because Hartley, 47, previously confirmed that Ackles is \u201cgonna come back\u201d for several episodes in season 2.\n\n\u201cWhen it was time to cast Russell Shaw, I was like, \u2018We built this whole thing up. It\u2019s important that we get somebody in there that is just a juggernaut. Somebody that you would believe because he\u2019s gonna go toe-to-toe with Colter, in a good or bad way, and that you also believe is his brother,\u2019\u201d the actor told Collider in May. \u201cAnd I just thought Jensen Ackles would be perfect for it.\u201d\n\nTracker airs on CBS Sundays at 8:30 p.m. ET. New episodes stream the next day on Paramount+."

WhatsApp is no exception, with the app gaining the services of the Meta AI chatbot not too long ago. We've seen WhatsApp make multiple changes to its Meta AI implementation over the past few updates, with the app recently adding granular editing controls for AI-generated images. WhatsApp is now working on another update for its AI chatbot, one that could make it easier to manage what it remembers about your chats.\n\nThe WhatsApp sleuths over at WABetaInfo dug into version 2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android to find a new Memory section within the app. More specifically, this Memory option has sprung up within the Chat info page, accessed by tapping the top of a chat.\n\nOn older betas of WhatsApp for Android, the Chat info page contains minimal options, including buttons for Message, Share, and Search, followed by a brief disclaimer about how AI can get things wrong at times.\n\nThere are also options for managing notifications and deciding whether media generated by Meta AI is saved to the device's gallery. But with v2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android, a brand-new Memory option appears right below Media visibility, along with the description \"What Meta AI remembers about you.\"\n\nA much-needed privacy addition\n\nWhatsApp Meta AI Memory Tab\n\nThe text inside the Memory page mentions that \"Meta AI automatically remembers certain parts of your chat to give you more relevant responses.\" Users can ensure the chatbot remembers something by asking it to \"remember this\" after a prompt. Having Meta AI remember specific parts of your conversation should help generate better-quality responses over a period of time, especially if it's a subject you bring up frequently with the chatbot.\n\nWhile it's unclear what this Memory page will look like when populated, we suspect there will be an easy option to remove any memory the chatbot has stored. WABetaInfo says this feature is still in development, which explains why I couldn't get it to appear despite sideloading the APK from APKMirror. Nevertheless, given how important a feature like this is, particularly from a privacy perspective, we expect it to eventually make it to the stable version of the chat app.\n\nWhatsApp Messenger\n\nWhatsApp LLC\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.3\n\nDownload"

The trail started with only 14 attractions but with the addition they will have 18 spooky attractions for people to see. And since its launch the trail has seen almost 5,000 participants sign up already, and those signatures have come from 39 different states and three different countries.\n\nAnd Lauren Bodnar, Director of Public Relations for the WV Department of Tourism said that this has already helped tourism in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cNot only are people excited about it but there coming here and there traveling around to these different stops,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nAnd the reason that it has garnered so much attention so fast, is because of social media which allows them to reach more people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something a little bit different that we\u2019ve done in the past, it just caught people\u2019s attention, I think,\u201d Bodnar said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s one part but also just our promotion on our social media helps spread the word pretty easily.\u201d\n\nThe four new attractions include the West Virginia Bigfoot Museum in Sutton, Silver Run Tunnel in Cairo, Cryptid Mountain Miniature Golf in Morgantown, and Hempfield Tunnel in Wheeling, however Bodnar says that there are a wide variety of what visitors can expect during the trail.\n\n\u201cThey really range from kind of these haunted tunnels, there\u2019s the insane asylum in Weston, there\u2019s the state penitentiary up north, so really there are a range of different places to visit across the state,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nYou can find the whole list of attractions when you go to the West Virginia Department of Tourism website.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s gained so much participation, Bodnar anticipates that the trail could be something they could keep going.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it\u2019s something that we would consider extending, especially if we get a lot of feedback, that it\u2019s something that people want to keep adding to and that they want to keep checking into,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nBodnar also said that they don\u2019t know every haunted attraction in the state, and they encourage people to go to their website to recommend an attraction.\n\nPeople who are interested in participating in the trail, can go to the Department of Transportation website and sign up for a virtual passport.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll sign up, you\u2019ll put in your name and some of your contact information in a form, and then the passport will be sent directly to your phone either via text or the email that you provided,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nAlthough the trail is related to all things spooky, it is expected to last until the end of this year."

You must take two materials that have the properties that you want and, like making a baby, you must see how to combine them to get exactly the offspring that you want.\n\nMeta (formerly, Facebook), often bashed for cashing-in on data, has now given a meta gift to mankind: tomes of data \u2014 for research into functional (meta) materials.\n\nThe global giant has just released copious amounts of data about behaviour of materials at the atomic level, under its Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) initiative, for free.\n\nThis data can help scientists combine different materials with different desired properties to create something new. Examples of functional materials that can tackle climate change include new catalysts for renewable energy storage, carbon neutral fuels, new sorbents for direct air capture, etc.\n\nCreating such materials is somewhat similar to discovering a drug molecule for disease by trying out different combinations of molecules or making a dish of desired taste, texture and flavour from millions of ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, making meta materials involved playing trial-and-error with millions of data points from thousands of materials. But now, there is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can deliver the goods, however, AI is data hungry.\n\nMeta has provided this food for AI. The OMat24 dataset is a collection of data generated from simulations and calculations on different inorganic materials. This dataset contains information on 118 million atomic structures, whichhas information on three parameters \u2014 total energy (the overall energy of the material\u2019s structure), forces (acting on each atom) and cell stress (indicating how the material could deform under certain conditions.) All this was calculated using \u2018density functional theory\u2019, a quantum mechanics-based method for predicting material properties .\n\n\u201cThe search space of possible materials is enormous and remains a significant challenge for both computational and experimental approaches to material science,\u201d says a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper by scientists at Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group. \u201cIdentifying promising candidates through computational screening with machine learning models offers the potential to dramatically increase the search space and the rate of experimental discovery,\u201d says the paper, written by Luis Borroso-Luque et al.\n\nFAIR scientists took over 400 million core-hours of computing to get the data of 118 million structures labelled with total energy, forces and cell stress. (One CPU core used for one hour is one core-hour.) These parameters give an idea of the stability of materials under given conditions.\n\nNow that there is data on over 118 million atomic structures, one can train an AI model to come up with the best combination of any of them for a desired material."

        "article_content": "Researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) have made a major breakthrough in agricultural biotechnology, focusing on the use of nanotechnology to combat E. coli contamination in rice crops. This discovery, led by Hamidreza Sharifan and his team, offers promising solutions for improving food safety and addressing bioterrorism threats.\n\nThe research centers on the development of advanced methods to detect and mitigate the effects of pathogens, particularly E. coli, which poses a significant threat to global food systems. The team, which includes Daisy Wilson, a Ph.D. student in environmental science and engineering, and Valeria Gonzalez, a senior undergraduate in forensic science, conducted groundbreaking work in biofortification and nanoparticle application to reduce microbial contamination.\n\n\u201cWe got an internship with the Department of Homeland Security as a team,\u201d Wilson told The Prospector, UTEP\u2019s student newspaper. \u201cIt was led by Dr. Sharifan, and he mentored myself and Valeria for the summer.\u201d\n\nThe research focused on the use of zinc oxide and magnesium oxide nanoparticles, which the team found to be highly effective in inhibiting E. coli growth. According to Gonzalez, the nanoparticles disrupted the cell membranes and metabolic processes of the bacteria, outperforming traditional ionic forms like magnesium sulfate and zinc sulfate.\n\n\u201cThese nanoparticles significantly inhibited E. coli growth by disrupting the cell membranes and metabolic processes,\u201d Gonzalez said in an interview with The Prospector. \u201cWe compared these with ionic forms like magnesium sulfate and zinc sulfate and found that the nanoparticles outperformed the ionic forms in preventing bacterial growth.\u201d\n\nThis discovery could have far-reaching implications for the agriculture industry and food safety standards, providing a new layer of protection against microbial contamination. In addition to their work with nanoparticles, the team has been researching the resilience of Mexican brown rice, which showed notable resistance to bacterial growth due to its high content of essential minerals and bioactive compounds.\n\nThe team\u2019s study emphasizes how integrating nanotechnology into agricultural practices could revolutionize food safety by reducing contamination risks and enhancing crop resilience. Dr. Sharifan noted the potential policy implications of this work, saying, \u201cRegulatory bodies could consider nanofortification as part of agricultural practices, which could enhance resilience against such threats.\u201d\n\nThough challenges remain, such as optimizing sterilization processes and ensuring the consistent application of nanoparticles, the team is confident their research will have a lasting impact on food safety protocols.\n\nThis pioneering work marks UTEP\u2019s first collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, further establishing the university as a key player in agricultural biotechnology research.\n\nFor more details, read The Prospector\u2019s story here.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)"

        "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 High Growth Software Stocks That Are Profitable In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) stands against the other high growth software stocks.\n\nThe Software Industry: An Analysis\n\nThe software market is experiencing robust growth, driven by various trends and technological advancements. According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments. The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms. While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 50 largest software companies by market cap.\n\nTo narrow down our list to high-growth software stocks, we focused on companies with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in net revenue exceeding 18% over the past 5 years.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of high-growth software stocks, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR and revenue CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of high-growth software stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024 are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT)\n\nTTM Net Income: $1.31 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 28.51%\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 23.11%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a cybersecurity company that develops and sells software and network security solutions. The company\u2019s portfolio of more than 50 enterprise-grade products is the largest integrated offering available, delivering protection to networks, users, and data from continually evolving threats.\n\nThe company is actively pursuing its strategy to lead in the rapidly growing Unified SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and Security Operations markets while also increasing its market share in Secure Networking. The company aims to differentiate itself as a SASE leader, being the only vendor recognized in multiple Gartner Magic Quadrant reports for both Single-Vendor SASE and various network security categories. By developing all SASE functions organically within a single operating system, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) offers a comprehensive stack that includes its market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB, Firewall, and more, enhancing user experiences while securing access to both on-premise and cloud applications.\n\nRecently, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) acquired Next DLP, a cloud-native data protection platform that will enable the company to enter the enterprise DLP market and enhance its SASE solutions.\n\nThe company is also enhancing its Secure Ops portfolio by leveraging over a decade of AI experience to provide advanced analytics and sensors that continuously monitor access activities for signs of cyber threats. In August, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) acquired Lacework, a cloud security and cloud-native application protection platform, which significantly broadens the company\u2019s security offerings and increases the company\u2019s total addressable market by $10 billion. This acquisition, combined with the integration of AI-driven solutions, positions Fortinet to deliver comprehensive protection across network, cloud, and endpoint environments.\n\nFrom its acquisitions of Next DLP and Lacework, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) will gain over 900 new customers along with skilled sales and engineering teams. This expansion will enhance the company\u2019s position in the market.\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) has seen impressive growth over the last five years, with revenue increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.11% and net income rising at a CAGR of 28.51%.\n\nOverall FTNT ranks 7th on our list of the high growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of FTNT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FTNT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\nDisclosure: None.
