        "article_content": "Q: We are seeking records on UFOs, and were told to try the Freedom of Information Act. First question, can you explain the Freedom of Information Act? Then, how do we go about requesting records?\n\nJ.V., Glendale\n\nA: The Freedom of Information Act (abbreviated as FOIA) provides you with the right to request access to records of the executive branch of the United States government. The records are to be provided, unless they are subject to certain exemptions whose purpose is to protect disclosure deemed harmful to: (a) national security, (b) privacy of individuals, (c) proprietary business information (such as trade secrets), (d) the actual functioning of our government, and/or (e) other interests that are deemed of significant importance. The exemptions are real, but FOIA requests often are productive.\n\nThe act dates from 1967 and took many years to become law. The objective is to make our government more transparent. As to UFOs (which the government now refers to as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d), federal agencies have been required this year to organize and tag documents. Congress has expressed clear interest in determining what agencies know about UFOs. Thus, the agencies are to disclose their information by the end of this fiscal year. The records are also to be housed at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of a FOIA request you can consider: Using letterhead, set forth the date you are sending it; then list the name and address of the executive agency where the request is being sent; then \u201cRE: FOIA REQUEST\u201d; followed by \u201cDear Sir or Madam: This is an authorized request to you under the Freedom of Information Act. Please provide the following records to the undersigned on a timely basis. \u2026\u201d Here, clearly set forth the records sought, describing them, if possible, by year(s), name of the party or parties involved, and/or the circumstances or events in focus. Then close the FOIA request with a sign off.\n\nNote that some agencies have instructions on where a FOIA request is to be sent (you can look for that online, or call to inquire). While it is not required that the FOIA request be transmitted by certified mail/return receipt requested, doing so is one way to seek to show that you not only sent it, but that it was received. The agency is required to respond within 20 working days (excluding weekends and legal holidays).\n\nQ: There was a local incident that at first was well reported. An older person was run over by a hit-and-run driver. We think they have since found the identity of the driver, who may be a local official, but there is radio silence. Our neighbor suggests we try a Public Records Act request. Can you give us some guidance on that?\n\nM.B., (location withheld)\n\nRelated Articles News | Am I liable for a slip and fall at a bowling alley?

Ask the lawyer A: The Public Records Act is found at California Government Code Sections 6250 through 6277. The act gives you, as a member of the public, the right to request information from California governmental agencies, which includes both state and local/municipal governments. In some instances, you may be able to learn online or by phone where to send the request, depending on which agency the request is going to (such as, the police department, highway patrol, zoning commission, district attorney\u2019s office or mayor\u2019s office, among others). As with a FOIA request, be specific about what you are seeking, and to whom and where the records are to be sent. The agency has 10 calendar days to respond to you, but may indicate it needs more time to locate, review and produce the records (which can mean a 14-day extension for \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d).\n\nAs with a FOIA request, some records may be deemed confidential or otherwise off-limits.\n\nA Public Records Act request, however, should not be costly or time consuming. It is the law, and compliance is expected to the extent authorized and permissible. I cannot say the request will unveil what you are looking for, and records you get may have redactions (which the agency can seek to justify), but, as they say, \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d\n\nRon Sokol has been a practicing attorney for over 40 years, and has also served many times as a judge pro tem, mediator, and arbitrator. It is important to keep in mind that this column presents a summary of the law, and is not to be treated or considered legal advice, let alone a substitute for actual consultation with a qualified professional."

        "article_content": "It's been a tumultuous week for OpenAI, full of executive departures and major fundraising developments, but the startup is back at it, trying to convince developers to build tools with its AI models at its 2024 DevDay. The company announced several new tools Tuesday, including a public beta of its \"Realtime API\", for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. It's not quite ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode, but it's close.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said the recent departures of chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief research officer Bob McGrew would not affect the company's progress.\n\n\"I'll start with saying Bob and Mira have been awesome leaders. I've learned a lot from them, and they are a huge part of getting us to where we are today,\" said Weil. \"And also, we're not going to slow down.\"\n\nAs OpenAI undergoes yet another C-suite overhaul \u2013 a reminder of the turmoil following last year's DevDay \u2013 the company is trying to convince developers that it still offers the best platform to build AI apps on. Leaders say the startup has more than 3 million developers building with its AI models, but OpenAI is operating in an increasingly competitive space.\n\nOpenAI noted it had cut costs for developers to access its API by 99% in the last two years, though it was likely forced to by competitors such as Meta and Google continuously undercutting their prices.\n\nOne of OpenAI's new features, dubbed the Realtime API, will give developers the chance to build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can't use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. (The voice ambiguously based on Scarlett Johansson's is not available anywhere.)\n\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI's head of developer experience, Romain Huet, shared a demo of a trip planning app built with the Realtime API. The application allowed users to verbally speak with an AI assistant about an upcoming trip to London, and get low-latency responses. The Realtime API also has access to a number of tools, so the app was able to annotate a map with restaurant locations as it answered.\n\nAt another point, Huet showed how the Realtime API could speak on the phone with a human to inquire about ordering food for an event. Unlike Google's infamous Duo, OpenAI's API can't call restaurants or shops directly; however, it can integrate with calling APIs like Twilio to do so. Notably, OpenAI is not adding disclosures so that its AI models automatically identify themselves on calls like this, despite the fact that these AI-generated voices sounds quite realistic. For now, it seems to be the developers' responsibility to add this disclosure, something that could be required by a new California law.\n\nAs part of its DevDay announcements, OpenAI also introduced vision fine-tuning in its API, which will let developers use images, as well as text, to fine-tune their applications of GPT-4o. This should, in theory, help developers improve the performance of GPT-4o for tasks involving visual understanding. OpenAI's head of product API, Olivier Godement, tells TechCrunch that developers will not be able to upload copyrighted imagery (such as a picture of Donald Duck), images that depict violence, or other imagery that violates OpenAI's safety policies.\n\nOpenAI is racing to match what its competitors in the AI model licensing space already offer. Its prompt caching feature is similar to the feature Anthropic launched several months agoallowing developers to cache frequently used context between API calls, reducing costs and improve latency. OpenAI says developers can save 50% using this feature, whereas Anthropic promises a 90% discount for it.\n\nLastly, OpenAI is offering a model distillation feature to let developers use larger AI models, such as o1-preview and GPT-4o, to fine-tune smaller models such as GPT-4o mini. Running smaller models generally provides cost savings compare to running larger ones, but this feature should let developers improve the performance of those small AI models. As part of model distillation, OpenAI is launching a beta evaluation tool so developers can measure their fine-tune's performance within OpenAI's API.\n\nDevDay may make bigger waves for what it didn't announce \u2013 for instance, there wasn't any news on the GPT Store announced during last year's DevDay. Last we've heard, OpenAI has been piloting a revenue share program with some of the most popular creators of GPTs, but the company hasn't announced much since then.\n\nAlso, OpenAI says it's not releasing any new AI models during DevDay this year. Developers waiting for OpenAI o1 (not the preview or mini version) or the startup's video generation model, Sora, will have to wait a little longer."

        "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 ChatGPT maker OpenAI will allow any app developer to add snappy and humanlike voice interaction to their products, a move that could greatly increase the number of people interacting with a slick and sometimes provocative new generation of artificial intelligence technology. OpenAI\u2019s \u201cadvanced voice mode,\u201d which offers six AI voices that sound casual and expressive, with the ability to detect and react to different human vocal tones, has been available to ChatGPT subscribers since July. The technology will now be offered to the thousands of companies that pay to use OpenAI technology in their own products \u2014 and any new developer who signs up.\n\nOpening more of its AI inventions to outsiders could help grow OpenAI\u2019s revenue from usage fees it charges each time an app taps its technology. Increasing that income is crucial to the company, which is seeking billions of dollars in new funding and considering restructuring to remove its business from the control of its existing nonprofit board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced it was opening access to its voice technology at an event in San Francisco for software developers. At a news briefing ahead of the event, OpenAI executives showed how an app built on its voice technology could make a phone call to a business and place an order for chocolate strawberries.\n\nThe business was not real and the person who took down the order and asked questions that the AI voice nimbly responded to was an OpenAI executive role-playing, but app developers will be able to deploy that capability immediately, the executives said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it possible to interact with AI in all of the ways you interact with a human being,\u201d OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said at the press briefing.\n\nFully achieving that goal would be challenging with existing AI technology, which often makes mistakes. But if app developers rush to build on OpenAI\u2019s voice algorithms, many more people could soon be using or exposed to automated systems that capably mimic people in some scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealistic voice synthesis technology has already been used in some call centers, but if OpenAI succeeds in making it more sophisticated and widespread, then consumers could encounter fresh frustrations or scams as well as new conveniences.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission last week fined a political consultant $6 million for using AI to fake the voice of President Joe Biden in New Hampshire robocalls earlier this year.\n\nIn 2018, Google debuted its AI voice bot, Google Duplex, that could call restaurants or salons to make reservations. But the humans employed by local businesses receiving the calls didn\u2019t always like it.\n\nInitially, Duplex did not disclose that it was a piece of software, until the backlash prompted Google to reprogram it to always introduce itself as an AI system. The feature hasn\u2019t caught on broadly, although Google Pixel phones can screen calls using similar technology and the company\u2019s cloud unit offers voice technology for call centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice bots have drastically improved over the past several years, with OpenAI\u2019s new voice mode for ChatGPT winning plaudits for its ability to carry out snappy conversations, understand complex topics and questions, sing, and respond to different tones of voice when it was first unveiled in May.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s system has been tuned to sound eager and polite, similar to the tone of ChatGPT\u2019s textual answers. The company offers six voices to choose from but retired its initial default, called \u201cSky,\u201d after Scarlett Johansson alleged the company copied her voice without permission. Documents shared with The Washington Post indicate a different actor was hired for recordings used to make the voice.\n\nOpenAI says 3 million developers in dozens of countries are now experimenting with its technology and using it to build new apps and features. Opening up its latest voice features could help grow that crucial user base and the revenue it provides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome tech investors and entrepreneurs say that just as the internet incubated giants such as Google and smartphones enabled businesses such as Uber and DoorDash, artificial intelligence will also spawn a wave of start-ups that become integral to peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nOther AI experts caution that new capabilities such as convincingly expressive voices can cause havoc in the wrong hands. An AI narration service marketed for audiobooks and video games was adapted to make the fake Biden robocalls placed in New Hampshire in January.\n\nOpenAI says that its rules ban developers from using its services to spam, mislead or harm people, and that it has built systems that monitor how people use its technology to shut down any who don\u2019t comply.\n\nDevelopers tapping the new voice offering must \u201cmake it clear to their users that they are interacting with AI, unless it\u2019s obvious from the context,\u201d the company said in a blog post about the new tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI\u2019s systems have been abused in the past, despite similar rules being in place for ChatGPT and its other services, including a ban on political campaigning."

        "article_content": "Perplexity is set to unveil its native Mac application on October 15. A dedicated landing page has appeared on the Mac App Store, offering details about the upcoming release and the features users can expect. As part of this launch, the company is also introducing Perplexity Pro, a premium subscription option that can be purchased through iTunes, aiming to position itself against competitors like OpenAI, which launched its ChatGPT app for Mac earlier this year.\n\nAccording to the Mac App Store listing, users can pre-order the Perplexity app, which will automatically install on their devices once it becomes available, provided they are connected to the Internet. This pre-order feature functions similarly to pre-installation processes seen on Android platforms.\n\nThe Perplexity Mac app promises to deliver all the functionalities available on its web, Android, and iOS versions. Users can enter queries, allowing the AI to sift through online resources to gather information. The app will present results in both bullet-point and paragraph formats, complete with citations to enable users to explore topics further and validate information. Additionally, users will be able to pose follow-up questions, with the AI capable of understanding context to deliver relevant answers. A curated Discover page will also be available to help users uncover new subjects to explore.\n\nEarlier this year, Perplexity launched a Pro Search feature, which leverages advanced inference techniques for in-depth analysis of search queries, particularly beneficial for niche or specialized topics.

That news isn\u2019t just landing on the hardware front, though, and Google\u2019s also got a whole mess of announcements to make about features landing across the Chromebook lineup \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t you guess it, but there\u2019s a heaping load of AI involved.\n\nFor starters, Google tells us, you can now chat with Gemini right from the shelf of any Chromebook model, Plus or not. You\u2019ll also find a new Welcome Recap screen greeting you when you first open up your laptop, reminding you of what you were working on earlier and giving you some tips for what to start with now. And for stuff you\u2019re frequently working with, and don\u2019t want to lose track of, you can easily pin files to your Chromebook\u2019s shelf.\n\nChromebook Plus models are getting a few upgrades beyond what the rest of the lineup will see, including AI-powered Live Translate for basically anything you\u2019re watching on your Chromebook screen. If you\u2019re looking to capture a conversation, the new Recorder app will offer automatic transcriptions, complete with speaker labels and summaries. And speaking of audio, Google\u2019s implementing some AI-based microphone simulation models to offer the highest possible fidelity on all your video calls. There are even some tweaks to boost camera performance, and neither of these upgrades will be restricted to Meet, and should offer enhanced performance across the board.\n\nLanh Nguyen / Android Authority\n\nThis new Chromebook Plus stuff should start arriving as updates hitting your Chromebook across the month of October \u2014 don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t see it land immediately, nor all at once. There\u2019s also the summary \u201cHelp me read\u201d feature for PDFs and websites that will start deploying in the weeks to come, and is already set to get a big update next year, letting you specify passages that require more detailed explanation.\n\nFinally, if any of this new functionality gets you feeling particularly excited about the power of AI (and we\u2019re betting Google hopes it might), the company is extending its offer for three free months of Google One AI Premium to all new Chromebook purchases.\n\nGot a tip?

        "article_content": "I have been warned. This much is clear within minutes of ducking out of a helicopter onto the high-desert oasis of Skinwalker Ranch in northeastern Utah one searingly bright October afternoon. As a visitor approaching the dark and inscrutable paranormal forces patrolling this property, I could be targeted.\n\nThe admonition has come in several forms. There was the prayer for safe deliverance given by chopper pilot Cameron Fugal, brother of property owner Brandon Fugal, as we approached the ranch. This didn\u2019t necessarily rattle me, as I\u2019d recently watched Cameron deliver a similar invocation on season one of The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, the hit History channel show that has generated mainstream attention for the property.\n\nThere was the surreal experience of being greeted on the helipad by about half the show\u2019s cast, whom I felt I\u2019d come to know during my hours of binge watching\u2014standing stone-faced and shoulder to shoulder like some official tribunal ready to deliver grim news. Long-suffering ranch superintendent Thomas Winterton, looking typically Marlboro Man, shook my hand first, followed by glowering security chief Bryant \u201cDragon\u201d Arnold. Erik Bard, the spritely scientist, and red-bearded security man Kaleb Bench chatted nearby. It was as if my arrival was the only thing holding up the start of the season five shoot. When we go inside, Winterton presents me with a liability waiver, which strikes me as highly unusual\u2014there\u2019s nothing on the day\u2019s agenda beyond an in-depth conversation.\n\nBut what truly tweaked my antennae was a conversation I\u2019d had an hour earlier, at the Fugals\u2019 hangar in Provo. Brandon was on the phone, tending to his day job as a commercial real-estate titan, and Cameron and I were chatting amiably when he suddenly pivoted from a story about becoming a grandfather. \u201cEvery time we bring somebody new, the ranch interacts a little different,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually it\u2019s been mostly mild. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d This struck me as a roundabout way of saying I should at least be a little worried.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some guys that are like, \u2018This is so stupid\u2014we\u2019re gonna show those aliens who\u2019s boss\u2026\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s messed with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to those guys?\u201d I asked. \u201cSomething physical, or their cell phones wigged out, or\u2014?\u201d\n\nIt was indeed bodily harm, Cameron said. The previous owner, Robert Bigelow, was haunted by the place, both during his time there and after, when \u201call the negativity followed him home,\u201d Cameron explained. This sounded a little like the aftermath of a bad Red Lobster meal, but I\u2019d seen the entire series at that point, and I knew what he meant. I\u2019d just never thought of it happening to me.\n\nDuring the flight, as Brandon recounted the particulars of acquiring the 512-acre ranch, I mentally rifled through the catalog of hazards the show has intimated: unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP, which is the modern term for UFO); cryptic messages transmitted through sound waves or electromagnetic interference; and, possibly most relevant, those weird injuries, including vertigo, nausea, temporary paralysis, hearing impairment, and disorientation, some of which led to hospitalizations.\n\nShortly after we arrive, I inquire about the ranch\u2019s tendency to identify and punish skeptics. The crew immediately warms to the topic. The visitors with the most serious health effects, Winterton says, \u201care the ones that came\u2014myself included\u2014with kind of a cavalier attitude of, \u2018There\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s gonna bother me.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible the group has inferred a certain skepticism from my request, a few weeks earlier, to camp overnight at the ranch\u2014an inquiry that Fugal shot down, citing liability and safety reasons. Can the capricious forces patrolling the property intuit my thoughts? It sounds a bit fantastical, but after hearing about other skeptics\u2019 experiences, I\u2019m not so sure anymore.\n\nBut as with seasickness and combat, there\u2019s no way to gauge in advance how you\u2019ll fare until you\u2019re in the thick of it. The only thing I know for sure is that I\u2019m about to find out.\n\nRussel Albert Daniels\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nPrior to my arrival at the ranch, the most unnerving thing I\u2019d experienced was Brandon Fugal\u2019s driving. He had picked me up that morning in Salt Lake City in his Lamborghini Urus Performante. Soon we were hurtling south on I-15 at 90 miles per hour to his airport hangar, while he expounded on his skepticism over TSA screenings and Covid-era face masks.\n\nHalfway to Provo, he explains that he acquired Skinwalker Ranch as an \u201copen-minded skeptic. I believed that there was most likely a natural explanation for all that had been reported. I had never seen a flying saucer or anything of the sort.\u201d The Lambo touched 99 as he veered right to blow by a car dawdling along at 90.\n\nJust like on the show, Fugal wore a fitted suit with a crisp, white dress shirt, fancy cowboy boots, and trademark wire-rim glasses\u2014Harry Potter meets Gordon Gekko. He leans into the narrative arc of the hard-charging business icon: He says he started in real estate at age 18 and sold his first office a year later, works 16- to 20-hour days, and has since reshaped Salt Lake City\u2019s skyline. He reveres Elon Musk and frequently name-drops rock stars and politicians in his orbit. (He hired the band Air Supply to play at his 2021 wedding.) Fugal describes himself as a 1980s teenager in a 50-year-old body, and boasts a vast collection of rare books and film memorabilia, including a full-size exoskeleton from the set of Terminator 2. And, most relevant to Skinwalker, he uses his fortune to underwrite certain science-driven moonshots.\n\nCourtesy Jason Shook /The HISTORY Channel\n\nIn 2009, Cameron had just landed his brother\u2019s private jet when, on a whim, Brandon asked him: How old is the technology and the physics behind this jet-propulsion system? The answer\u2014the 1940s\u2014shocked him. Fascinated by the question of how science had stalled in that realm, Brandon began researching alternative forms of propulsion, which led to a brief partnership with a former client, Joe Firmage, an early internet entrepreneur and UAP aficionado. Firmage claimed he was on the cusp of breakthrough technologies that enable purported UFOs to move in unorthodox and physics-defying ways. The project cratered, but in the aftermath Fugal was introduced to Robert Bigelow, a maverick billionaire who used his Las Vegas real-estate fortune to build a private aerospace firm. Bigelow Aerospace developed an expandable habitat for astronauts on the International Space Station before shuttering operations in 2020.\n\nBigelow, who has also espoused the presence of aliens and UAPs, is largely responsible for putting Skinwalker Ranch on the map. Established as an agricultural homestead in 1905, for more than a century the ranch experienced reports of strange activity, and as a result had been named for shape-shifting witches of Navajo lore. As early as 1911, a newspaper reported locals hearing \u201cstrange noises\u201d emanating from the property, and a string of subsequent owners reported UAPs or other strange activity. Bigelow purchased it in 1996 from ranchers Terry and Gwen Sherman, who had been so spooked by their experiences there\u2014which included UAP activity, cattle mysteriously slain, dire wolf\u2013type creatures, and glowing orbs they say vaporized their dogs\u2014that they eagerly unloaded the place.\n\nAround the time he purchased the property, Bigelow founded and bankrolled the National Institute of Discovery Science, with the goal of conducting serious scientific study of UFOs and other paranormal activities at Skinwalker and beyond. He quickly installed a network of investigators who reported their own paranormal happenings at the ranch. A book written by chief investigator Colm Kelleher and news anchor George Knapp describes one incident in which something had disgorged the wiring within a closed-circuit ranch video camera while another camera, trained on it, captured no activity. The team produced another report detailing the 1998 killing of a perfectly healthy three-year-old cow. There were no signs of struggle and no tracks found, but the animal was missing its left eye and part of its left ear. Additionally, its heart was shredded, but its pericardium\u2014the sac that encloses the organ and its major vessels\u2014was intact.\n\nBigelow\u2019s project later morphed into the Pentagon-funded Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies program. From 2008 to 2013, the program recorded more than 530 instances of paranormal activity witnessed by more than 150 people.\n\nWhen Fugal met Bigelow in Las Vegas, he only knew what he\u2019d read in Knapp and Kelleher\u2019s book, and he told Bigelow he thought what had been seen at the ranch \u201cwas the product of groupthink mixed with misidentifying naturally occurring phenomena.\u201d\n\nBy that point Fugal was leading the largest commercial real-estate enterprise in the intermountain west, with 30 offices in 11 states. He didn\u2019t expect that alien sightings and disemboweled livestock would play well in his rarefied circles. \u201cI did not want my name associated with these topics,\u201d he says. But Fugal was intrigued, and after a series of lengthy conversations with Bigelow in 2016, he quietly bought the ranch for about $500,000 through a shell corporation called Adamantium Real Estate, named for the fictional alloy used to make Wolverine\u2019s claws in Marvel Comics. Several days before the closing, he flew out to see the ranch for the first time and was stunned by the dramatic landscape: the high-desert mesa plateau, the snaking course of Dry Gulch Creek, the clutch of dilapidated pioneer homesteads evoking a complex history.\n\nHe\u2019d been an Eagle Scout growing up and was now on the board of the Utah National Parks Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He figured he\u2019d have a scientific team determine there was nothing untoward about the property, then he would donate it for scout camps and youth programs.\n\nBut before he could put that plan in motion, things started happening.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWe settle into the main room of the Skinwalker Ranch headquarters, and the conversation naturally drifts toward the crew\u2019s conversion stories, meaning the experiences that led them to believe that strange forces are afoot here.\n\nWinterton, the ranch superintendent, grew up in the Uinta Basin, the geological feature that encompasses Skinwalker. His first time there\u2014as a nonbelieving building inspector\u2014he experienced severe vertigo and lightheadedness. \u201cI finally had to back up against the wall and then I kind of slid down towards the floor,\u201d he says.\n\nNone of these tellings is more compelling than Fugal\u2019s. In 2016, an employee recorded a UFO sighting on his phone\u2019s camera, snapping pictures of a horizontal object in the sky at a time when flight data showed there was no commercial or private air traffic over the ranch. The employee reported it to Fugal, who immediately began studying the images. Four months later, Fugal says he and two security guards saw a silver-gray spaceship-type object moving erratically above the mesa that borders the property.\n\nAnd thus Fugal made the shift\u2014in his words\u2014\u201cfrom being a healthy skeptic to an experiencer.\u201d Since then, he has intensively pursued an understanding of what he describes as \u201chigh strangeness.\u201d He erected a gate to seal off the property, installed a web of security cameras, and has poured millions of dollars into advanced technological instruments aimed at quantifying the ranch\u2019s mysteries.\n\nErik Bard, an X-ray physicist, is one of the lead experts Fugal hired to harvest and interpret the reams of data these instruments have produced. Before moving to the ranch full-time, Bard was a partner in a firm that makes components for machines that produce or measure X-rays; many of its products go to the national labs, he says.\n\nBard has his own conversion story. He had dismissed what he\u2019d heard about the ranch as \u201cE.T. interdimensional religious whatever.\u201d Then Fugal invited him to visit in October 2016\u2014coincidentally, the same day that Fugal saw the UAP\u2014and two things happened: On a trek out to the mesa, Bard pulled out his phone to take a picture and saw that the screen was flickering. At first, he thought he had broken it.\n\nWhen he and others in his group returned to the homestead, Bard says he couldn\u2019t keep his balance, and several others said they felt the ground spin. \u201cThe interesting thing is, I hadn\u2019t told them that I was experiencing it,\u201d he recalls.\n\nBard figured he\u2019d try to make sense of these occurrences using science. First, he examined the phone malfunction. In an area with poor reception, a smartphone\u2019s RF (radio frequency) components emit extra energy working to connect to a cell tower, which can interfere with other parts of the unit. Bard thought this was a perfectly good explanation, except that he couldn\u2019t reproduce it. Several months later he tried a different experiment using a powerful rare-earth magnet capable of lifting 1,750 pounds of iron. When he put his phone on the edge of the magnet, he reproduced the effect.\n\nThe answer seemed to be the ranch\u2019s unusual electromagnetic field, and specifically, a phenomenon called electromagnetic interference. In subsequent years, he and others have repeatedly dealt with more instances of what he experienced on his phone. Drones have mysteriously crashed; batteries on phones and other devices\u2014ranging from boom microphones to H4n recorders\u2014have suddenly drained. The ranch\u2019s computer and surveillance systems have malfunctioned. These glitches haven\u2019t just impacted the ranch\u2019s equipment, Bard says, but also the equipment being brought in by outside experts.\n\nBard, who is more engaging and animated in person than on TV, read that strong magnetic fields also affect the human nervous system. MRI technicians, Bard explains, experience many of the same symptoms that people have at the ranch, including vertigo and nausea. These studies plus his benchtop experiment pointed to a magnetic field anomaly. \u201cThat was the beginning of trying to put a physics interpretation on some part of the phenomenon,\u201d he says.\n\nThe source of the electromagnetic activity is another question: Bard speculates that it could be linked to some physics quirk in the space-time realm or something technological\u2014a cloaked craft or UAP. Bard is still hunting for answers.\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBard\u2019s super-magnet experiment is only one of the myriad scientific forays into the site, as the show\u2019s viewers know well. It\u2019s possible that no wild space in the country has been as closely scrutinized as this one. Just about everything across the landscape has been analyzed, poked, and sampled.\n\nThe crew has deployed hyperspectral imaging technology, which reveals light on parts of the spectrum humans can\u2019t otherwise see. There are aircraft transponder data receivers; laboratory-grade thermographic imaging systems; advanced magnetometers; forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, which detect infrared radiation and convert it to an image; and a geophone-based near-field seismometer, to ensure that no seismic wave goes undetected. Much of this tech is military-grade, Fugal says.\n\nThe team has mapped every inch of the ranch using a combination of LIDAR, drone-based photogrammetric mapping, and ground-penetrating radar. They\u2019ve collected and analyzed samples using X-ray fluorescence. At one point, Bard and his crew brought in a team to aim high-powered optical lasers\u2014devices colorfully known as a laser space cannons\u2014at the sky above the ranch to search for more evidence of whatever invisible forces may hover overhead.\n\nCurious findings keep the crew\u2014and viewers\u2014energized. Bard beckons me into the control room to show me what one of the simpler pieces of equipment\u2014a surveillance camera stationed in Homestead 2\u2014harvested. Feeds from the 50 or so audio-enabled security cameras across the property are available to Skinwalker Ranch Insiders, which is essentially a fan club. For a membership that starts at $8 a month, participants get access to \u201cdisturbing & anomalous audio, infrasonic, & frequency data,\u201d according to the website. The more than 10,000 Insiders who have so far subscribed also get 24-hour access to the ranch webcams. Not only that, Bard has steampunked the system so that they are also able to control the cameras, and swivel them if they spot something. This has essentially created a community of volunteer citizen scientists. (\u201cIt\u2019s like giving someone the keys to the International Space Station and being able to steer it around and position and explore the cosmos,\u201d Fugal says.)\n\nOne Insider reported what Bard shows me now: At 1:39 a.m. one night, a door on Homestead 2 abruptly slammed shut. There was no wind, and no sign of anyone on camera. Played on repeat in grainy night-vision video, it\u2019s undeniably creepy.\n\nRussel Albert Daniels\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always obvious that a TV show was the way to go. Fugal says after he was approached by the History channel in 2018, he only agreed to the show on three conditions: Nothing could be faked; the film crew had to use the investigators he\u2019d hired; and his identity was to remain secret. The History Channel team agreed to the first two mandates\u2014the show\u2019s creators say that any staged reenactments are based on eyewitness accounts\u2014but rejected the third, when the producers convinced him the research would only be believable if there was full transparency.\n\nAs it happened, the world was changing fast regarding perceptions of such phenomena\u2014in particular, UAPs. Owing to a surge in military-pilot sightings, whistleblower pressure, and media coverage, UAPs were being legitimized in Congress and acknowledged more openly by the defense and intelligence communities, shifting the phenomena from the tinfoil-hat realm into the cultural mainstream.\n\nIn 2018, Fugal and his team, including three scientists, shared some of the data they\u2019d collected with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee in a confidential briefing in Washington, D.C. Fugal says he maintains contact with Utah\u2019s senior senator, Mike Lee, and the state attorney general, Sean Reyes. \u201cThere has been a seismic shift in the way the government is approaching the topic,\u201d he says.\n\nBut government knowledge is still largely blanketed in secrecy, and Bigelow\u2019s findings on the ranch have similarly remained hidden from the public, even to Fugal; the program was secretly funded by the Pentagon, and its contents remain undisclosed. This is partly why he pivoted in the opposite direction. Everything his team learns is shared openly, he says, through the show or the phalanx of cameras, or both.\n\nThis was a canny move, to not only be transparent with what was going on there but to make transparency part of the point: Maybe you don\u2019t believe in this, but you can believe in how we\u2019re doing it. For a curious public starved by generations of government intransigence, this has been raw meat tossed to hungry wolves. \u201cPeople want brutal honesty,\u201d he says\u2014and 2.22 million viewers tuned into the 2023\u2013\u201924 season, making it the 10th most popular non-sports cable program.\n\nFugal says he\u2019s never taken a penny for the show\u2014that he\u2019s given it all to charity and put it back into the ranch equipment. But he is clearly an adroit businessman with a nose for opportunity; soon after purchasing the ranch, he trademarked the name for purposes of the TV show and for use on merchandise such as T-shirts and mugs. The show has made him a celebrity\u2014it \u201chas turned my world upside down,\u201d he says. He was even recognized on the street during a recent trip to France and Italy.\n\nIt\u2019s clear he has fully shed any reservations he once harbored about serving as Skinwalker\u2019s front man. On the show, he drops lines like \u201cWe\u2019ll come to understand the dark forces that we\u2019re interacting with, but also the nature of our world and our reality\u201d without a hint of self-consciousness. He\u2019s a rabid fan of 1980s science fiction; one of his prized possessions is a copy of the E.T. screenplay. What better way to feed that appetite than to hypothetically possess his own E.T.?\n\nFugal says he\u2019s often asked what he believes they are dealing with. Could it be extraterrestrials? Multidimensional beings? Or some spiritual influence? \u201cI answer it\u2019s likely D: all of the above,\u201d he says. The data they\u2019ve collected over the years suggest there could be a wide range of origins and agendas associated with the phenomena. \u201cThe deeper the investigation digs both literally and figuratively,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more complicated it becomes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBy the time we wander out for a tour, the landscape is so dazzling I find it hard to muster much concern for my safety. The sky is vast and clear and the cottonwood trees are gilded in autumnal splendor. As we walk through and around the tumbledown homesteads, I pay particular attention to the largest of the three buildings that comprise Homestead 2\u2014the site of the mysterious slamming door spotted by a Skinwalker Ranch Insider.\n\nFrom the outside, the doorframe is dark and vacant, like a missing tooth; the modest two-room shack, now more than a century old, has gradually submitted to the forces of weather and age. Inside, leaves are scattered across the floorboards, and sunlight glides through the failing ceiling as if filtered through a julienne slicer. I see no evidence of wires that could have been rigged there to cause the sudden, unexplained movement. Gusts often cause doors to swing shut, but this one closed from the inside; the windows are empty cavities and there\u2019s a hole in the roof, so there would be no way to build up any air pressure inside. The camera had shown the whole room, and nothing had moved prior to the door opening. \u201cLook at the debris on the floor,\u201d Fugal says. If it had been windy, leaves and other detritus would have been blowing everywhere.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating, but there\u2019s no way to make sense of it, and little time to linger. Moving around in Rhino-type vehicles used on the show, we cruise over to the \u201cTriangle.\u201d Investigators zeroed in on this patch of otherwise unremarkable land between the headquarters and the homesteads as a potential hotbed of paranormal activity during the show\u2019s latter seasons after chronicling\n\nunexplained interference with helicopter flights, drones, and other forms of aerial exploration.\n\nThe site consists of a set of jeep roads that form its geometric namesake, but we didn\u2019t bother walking around; most of what makes the location interesting\u2014at least for fans of the show\u2014is invisible. The cast filled entire episodes with experiments that included elevating a squadron of drones and shooting rockets skyward to see if they could figure out what was occurring in the airspace above. These experiments have led the group to believe there may be some sort of interdimensional portal. It sounds far-fetched, but millions of viewers keep coming back for more.\n\nRussel Albert Daniels\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nCinematic as all of this is, what none of this technology has been able to provide so far is much in the way of concrete answers. The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch is a sumptuous buffet for conspiracy-driven UFOlogists and paranormal enthusiasts, unabashedly splicing supposition, folklore, and unexplained sightings with a series of high- and low-tech experiments. The result is a kind of true-believer cut-up, and viewers may feel they\u2019ve learned a lot but have no clue what any of it amounts to.\n\nFive seasons in, one question that emerges is whether a force intelligent enough to avoid detection, or reveal itself at will, can ever be identified. This plays into the producers\u2019 hands, of course; a malevolent force that can reveal itself in opportune moments yet avoid detection drives the need for more investigations, and more television seasons. It creates a waves-against-the-shore rhythm, in which the cast experiences something, excitedly conducts a series of experiments\u2014only to wind up, in some cases, with more questions than they had before. The tide advances and retreats, continually polishing the ranch\u2019s legend in the process. But how long can they maintain the tension, and keep the audience entertained, while concrete answers remain just out of reach?\n\nThe next day, Fugal revs up another one of his toys\u2014a Ferrari 488 Spider\u2014for a final lunch meeting. Just before we leave the restaurant, I ask him something I\u2019ve been pondering since he turned down my camping request: Will he even reopen the ranch to the public? Let us see for ourselves?\n\nHe shakes his head. Having a secure, living laboratory, he claims, will allow us to develop insights that could change the course of history. \u201cI know that sounds like hyperbole, but you look at the topics we\u2019re discussing, the implications,\u201d he says, \u201cif you don\u2019t understand the weight and significance, then you perhaps are not\u2026 I think the appropriate way to say this is, you\u2019re not ready.\u201d\n\nIf the public at large is frustrated by this, they\u2019re not showing it. Yes, there are some snarky reviews, but Fugal says he\u2019s selling plenty of hats, DVDs, and T-shirts. The crew was about to start shooting a sixth season, and the series has spun off into Beyond Skinwalker Ranch, a History channel show that will probe other paranormal hotspots.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll never be ready myself to grasp the significance of the site in the way that Fugal has. But my visit, in the end, did suggest one potential explanation for the enduring nature of this phenomenon. Maybe the real fantasy of Skinwalker Ranch isn\u2019t that answers to the strange occurrences there will be identified, but that they were ever identifiable in the first place.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can report: I never felt dizzy or experienced any sudden pain. I did not exit the ranch anxious that I was being shadowed by some unknowable force, nor did my phone or digital recorder glitch. But I did feel something. It was the same thing I\u2019d experienced coming off gigantic, twirl-you-upside-down amusement park rides\u2014the ones where the caution signs are a little larger, and even though they\u2019re for legal purposes, they add a fizz of danger. You know the sensation: You unbuckle and your hair is blown back and you feel buzzy from the thrill. Maybe, if you\u2019re a fan of The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, it\u2019s the same feeling you have watching the show, in its best moments.\n\nAre there really UFOs and dire wolves haunting this lonesome patch of high desert in eastern Utah? In the end, for millions of fans, the answer may not really matter.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

        "article_content": "(This story has been updated to include new information.)\n\nFormer president Donald Trump returned to Wisconsin Tuesday, making campaign stops in Dane County and Milwaukee. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff also spoke in Milwaukee Tuesday afternoon on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.\n\nTrump delivered remarks at Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee, about 13 miles north of Madison, and then spoke in a closed-to-the-public event at Discovery World, a science museum along Lake Michigan, in Milwaukee.\n\nEmhoff spoke at Diamond Discs International, a small manufacturing business in Milwaukee. Harris last held a rally in Wisconsin Sept. 20 in Madison.\n\nHere's a recap of the day:\n\nTrump ends his remarks to the media in Milwaukee\n\nTrump wrapped up his event in Milwaukee around 7 p.m., about an hour before the vice presidential debate starts.\n\nHe took questions from reporters for about 45 minutes after giving remarks that were similar to the points he made in Waunakee.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump hints at potential rallies at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Green Bay\n\nWhile speaking at Discovery World, Trump hinted his team is looking at holding a rally at Fiserv Forum, which hosted the Republican National Convention in July. Harris also held a rally at the home of the Milwaukee Bucks during the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"The building was beautiful,\" Trump said. \"I love Milwaukee. We had such a great convention here. They treated us so well. I also like the result. If I didn't get the right result, I probably wouldn't like Milwaukee. I got a great result.\"\n\nTrump added he'll announce a rally in Green Bay soon, potentially the day before a Green Bay Packers game. He also hinted at a third event that would be similar to the press conference format of the Tuesday night event in Milwaukee, which was ultimately closed to the public.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nU.S. Rep. Bryan Steil praises Trump for campaigning in blue areas\n\nAt a panel discussion before Trump spoke in Milwaukee, Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil praised the former president for \"campaigning in two of the most blue areas of our state.\"\n\n\"We as conservatives, we as Republicans, we as supporters of President Trump, know that we have the answers to the challenges that our country faces, that our communities face. In particular, blue cities across the country, and the challenges that they face,\" Steil said.\n\nSteil said he attended the opening of a GOP Hispanic outreach center in Milwaukee this weekend. The state party announced the new center after the national party abandoned its own center in the city early last year.\n\nSteil said voters who were excited to vote for Trump connected with issues like inflation, school choice, crime and national defense.\n\nSteil represents the southeastern portion of Wisconsin, including Racine and Kenosha. He is running for reelection and faces Democratic opponent Peter Barca, who once held the seat.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nSpeakers focus on school choice ahead of Trump visit to Discovery World\n\nA panel of speakers that included advocates, elected officials, students and a school principal spoke ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival at Discovery World in Milwaukee.Their comments focused on school choice, with students speaking to the opportunities their schools have offered them.\u201cI can't tell you how many people I talk to, how many moms and dads I talk to about the importance of school choice, a policy championed by conservatives, championed by Republicans, championed by President Trump,\u201d Steil said.\n\n\u201cAnd it's a policy that says moms and dads should have a choice to choose the school that's best for their child, to make sure that their child is in an environment where there they can succeed.\u201d\u2014 Alison Dirr\n\nUnclear why Trump's Milwaukee event is closed to public\n\nWhile general admission tickets were available for Trump's appearance at Discovery World, the public was ultimately not allowed entry. Members of the media were let in for a press conference-like event, though some supporters lingered outside in the afternoon, hoping to be admitted.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service told the Journal Sentinel it wasn't tracking any security issues and any changes to the event format were likely a decision made by the campaign. The campaign declined to comment.\n\nThe Secret Service noted Trump is receiving a heightened level of Secret Service protection and \"there are significant security measures put into place for tonight's event.\"\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nDoug Emhoff addresses crowd at Diamond Disc International\n\nSecond gentlemen Doug Emhoff addressed about 100 people at Diamond Disc International, saying Harris is \u201ca capitalist, pro-growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows the limitations of government,\u201d Emhoff said, adding that Harris looks for \u201cpragmatic solutions.\u201d\n\nEmhoff also criticized Trump for \u201cducking\u201d a second debate.\n\n\u201cShe kicked his ass at that first debate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Ricardo Torres\n\nDiamond Disc president endorses Harris\n\nDiamond Discs International president Ugo Nwagbaraocha endorsed Harris for president, saying a Harris presidency would benefit businesses like his.\n\nNwagbaraocha said Trump \u201cdid nothing\u201d for his business and called the Foxconn project in Mount Pleasant \u201cWeasel-conn.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ricardo Torres\n\nTrump ends Waunakee speech around 3:20 p.m.\n\nTrump spoke for about an hour and 15 minutes in Waunakee, wrapping up his speech at 3:20 p.m.\n\n\"Remember, early mail-in voting is underway,\" Trump told the crowd. \"So vote, vote, vote. You got to get going.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to appear at Discovery World at 5 p.m. It's not yet clear whether he's making the hour-and-a-half drive or traveling by plane to Milwaukee.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump supporters line up outside Discovery World, hoping event remains public\n\nTrump supporters lined up outside Discovery World early Tuesday afternoon even as rumbles of the event\u2019s closure to the public were circulating among the crowd.\n\nBradley Kahn, 35, of Chicago said he had tried to attend a Trump event in 2015 but it was canceled. He\u2019s been hoping to see him since, and Milwaukee was a close destination.\n\nHe wanted to get a selfie Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf it gets canceled today, I would be pretty upset,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was hoping to hear from Trump about election strategy, particularly immigration policy and employment.\n\nAhead in the line, Kelly McAuliffe said she and her family members arrived at Discovery World from the Chicago suburbs around 5 a.m.\n\nShe said the event invitation said there was limited space but that, since she arrived, police had over time moved attendees back from the front door.\n\nBy early afternoon, the line of a few dozen people stretched west on the sidewalk between Discovery World and the Milwaukee Art Museum.\n\nShe was no longer optimistic that she and other supporters would be getting into the event.\n\n\u2014 Alison Dirr\n\nDoug Emhoff will visit Diamond Discs International\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff and former Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo will deliver remarks at Diamond Discs International, a small manufacturing business in Milwaukee.\n\nThey'll also get a tour of the building.\n\n\u2014 Ricardo Torres\n\nDoug Emhoff lands in Milwaukee\n\nTrump again criticizes prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner\n\nTrump on Tuesday again criticized a prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner and arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nBout, the so-called \u201cmerchant of death,\u201d was exchanged in a 2022 prisoner swap for Griner, who had spent nearly a year in Russian captivity.\n\nTrump again essentially accused Griner of not being patriotic enough, saying she \u201ctied her shoes\u201d during the national anthem.\n\nGriner played for Team USA in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, winning gold both times.\n\nThen, at the 2024 Paris Olympics, as Griner stood on the medal stand with her third gold medal draped around her neck, tears streamed down her face as she stood for the national anthem.\n\nLast year, Bout urged Trump to seek refuge in Russia, saying he believed his life was \u201cin peril.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump falsely claims immigrants are being signed up to vote\n\nWhile touching on immigration, Trump claimed immigrants are being registered to vote, a claim PolitiFact has debunked before.\n\n\"There's a reason why they let all these people in, because they want to get them to vote,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump didn't mention a Republican-led referendum question on the Nov. 5 ballot in Wisconsin, which aims to prevent noncitizens from voting in local elections in the future. Some cities in the U.S. do allow that, but nowhere in Wisconsin does.\n\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission has said it knows of only four alleged cases of voter fraud related to citizenship since 2015. Wisconsin's voter registration form includes a checkbox confirming the voter is a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump calls Tommy Thompson 'the dean'\n\nTrump shouted out former Wisconsin governors Scott Walker and Tommy Thompson, who also spoke at the rally Tuesday. Trump called Thompson \"so respected\" and \"the dean.\"\n\nTrump said Thompson called him during his 2016 campaign, expressing doubts about Trump's ability to win Wisconsin and telling him to campaign in other battlegrounds.\n\n\"He said, 'Here's a deal. If I think you're going to win, I'll call you back,'\" Trump said. \"He called me about three weeks later. He said, 'It's time to come up. You're going to win this thing.'\"\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump falsely claims there was a 'coup' when Harris became Democratic nominee\n\nTrump again falsely claimed that there was a \u201ccoup\u201d when Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nHe added that Walker \u201csays it was a coup,\u201d and also mentioned Thompson as he repeated his claims that \u201cit was a coup.\u201d\n\nBut a coup, or coup d\u2019etat, is defined as a sudden, violent and unlawful seizure of power, experts say. So while Biden\u2019s exit from the race was unusual, experts say it does not amount to a \u201ccoup.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comments undermining confidence in this year's presidential election echo the tactics he used in 2020 when he lost to Biden.\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump claims 50,000 people were turned away from Prairie du Chien rally\n\nAfter taking the stage at Dane Manufacturing, Trump claimed 50,000 to 60,000 people were turned away from his Saturday rally in Prairie du Chien.\n\nAbout a thousand people were standing in line to get into the rally, but the auditorium sat somewhere near 300 people.\n\nThe rally was initially planned to be held outdoors but switched to indoors over Secret Service staffing concerns. The agency was responsible for securing the United Nations General Assembly summit in New York on the same day.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump starts after about a 30-minute delay\n\nTrump took the stage at 2:05 p.m., about a half hour behind schedule.\n\nIn the meantime, attendees heard standard songs on Trump's rally playlist, including \"YMCA\" and \"Macho Man\" by the Village People and \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan.\n\nThere were some newer additions: \"Give Me Everything\" by Pitbull and \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nWisconsin union president accuses Trump of 'shell game' on overtime\n\nA Wisconsin union president is accusing Trump of playing a \"shell game\" when it comes to overtime pay and protections.\n\n\"He is claiming that he will eliminate taxes on overtime pay but he fails to mention that he would do so by eliminating overtime pay altogether,\" Stephanie Bloomingdale, the Wisconsin AFL-CIO president, said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nShe referred to Trump's recent comments at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, that he \"hated\" to give overtime and \"wouldn't pay\" it.\n\nBloomingdale also referred to Project 2025, which Trump has been trying to distance himself from in recent months.\n\n\"When Donald Trump comes here and tries to sell this underhanded scam, we are wise to the lie he is again trying to sell,\" she said. \"The truth is that Donald Trump does not care about the well-being of Wisconsin working people and he never has.\"\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visiting areas affected by Hurricane Helene before Thursday's Wisconsin visit\n\nBefore heading to Wisconsin on Thursday, Harris will visit areas affected by Hurricane Helene.\n\nHarris is scheduled to go to Georgia on Wednesday, according to a White House pool report. She will also travel to North Carolina, the pool report said.\n\nTrump traveled to the storm-hit battleground state of Georgia to survey damage from Helene . Trump told reporters, \"We're not talking about politics now,\" but he then criticized Biden and Harris over the administration's hurricane response in the hours leading up to the trip.\n\nBiden has pushed back on false claims made by Trump over his response to the disaster.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a liar,\" read a post on X from Biden. \"I\u2019m working with governors and local officials to help those impacted by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\nHarris cut a previous campaign trip short to return to Washington, D.C., for briefings about the disaster.\n\nShe's planning to address voters in the Fox Valley on Thursday, according to an advisory to voters from Wisconsin Democrats.\n\nThe visit would be Harris' fifth to Wisconsin since she became the Democrats' presidential nominee in late July. The Harris campaign early Tuesday declined to comment on her travel plans, and a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin didn't respond to a message about the advisory.\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump crowd count at 500 indoors, 4,500 outside\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, the Dane Manufacturing facility held 500 people ahead of Trump's remarks, while about 4,500 stood outside the building.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nWalker, Thompson encourage '72-county strategy' for Trump in Wisconsin\n\nWalker and Thompson greeted the crowd at Dane Manufacturing ahead of Trump's remarks, each stressing the need for Republicans to cut into the strong Democratic margins in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\n\"You need to go beyond your comfort zone. You need to talk to family and friends, neighbors and coworkers, including some who maybe don\u2019t typically vote for a Republican,\" Walker said. \"Remind them ... this simple truth. Life was better when Donald Trump was president of the United States.\"\n\nWalker argued that any distaste for Trump's rhetoric is negated by his approach to the economy, the border and violent crime.\n\nThompson, in a rousing speech, reiterated his insistence that Trump can win Wisconsin by increasing his vote share in the state's two most liberal counties.\n\n\"You have to go where the votes are. You have to go where the opposition is. You have to come into Dane County, Milwaukee County and southwestern Wisconsin,\" he said. \"Dane County has the third-most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin, and all we have to do is increase them.\"\n\n\"Democrats,\" he said, \"get the hell out of our way.\"\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nGov. Tony Evers criticizes Trump's visits\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday morning, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said, \"I know Wisconsin families, and they\u2019re going to reject (Trump) again in November.\"\n\n\"As president, Donald Trump was a disaster for Wisconsin, and we haven\u2019t forgotten. A second term would be a heck of a lot worse \u2014 Trump\u2019s extreme Project 2025 agenda would hurt working families, cut Social Security and Medicare, dismantle support for public education across the country and more,\" Evers said. \"Vice President Harris is the only candidate in this race fighting to lower costs, cut taxes and invest in Wisconsin\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump campaign releases statement on Emhoff visit\n\nIn a statement, Wisconsin press secretary for Trump's campaign, Jacob Fischer, said \"no visit from Doug Emhoff can conceal the reality that the dangerously liberal Harris-Walz agenda will be one that Wisconsinites simply can't afford.\"\n\n\"Emhoff has stood on the sidelines for four years of failure, and it's time to retire his second gentleman title. President Trump and JD Vance will lower taxes, empower our businesses and put hard-working Americans first, while Harris and Walz advance dangerously liberal policies and bankrupt our country,\" Fischer said.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nFormer Gov. Tommy Thompson 'so happy' Trump is competing in Dane County\n\nThompson told reporters at Trump's event in Waunakee he's \"so happy\" the former president honored his request to visit Dane County.\n\nIn an interview last month on WISN-TV's \"Upfront,\" Thompson said he told Trump during his August rally in La Crosse that to win Wisconsin, he'll have to compete in the liberal strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee counties \u2014 areas that have rarely been a focus for Republican candidates.\n\nThompson, the state's longest-serving governor, told reporters Tuesday that by campaigning in both counties in one day, the former president will send a message that: \"I want your vote. I'm here in Dane County because I\u2019m going to compete for your votes all over the state of Wisconsin.\"\n\nTrump lost the village of Waunakee by 28 points in 2020 \u2014 about half his losing margin countywide.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nWhere is Waunakee, Wisconsin, the site of Trump's visit?\n\nWaunakee is about 13 miles north of Madison. It's in the northern part of Dane County, a county that produces large Democratic margins that present headaches for Republicans.\n\nIn 2020, Trump lost the village of Waunakee by 28 points, about half his losing margin in the county. Waunakee has a population of about 15,000.\n\nEric Hovde, the Republican candidate for Senate running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, also visited Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee in September, where he took questions from employees.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nDiscovery World has hosted Harris, Vance and now Trump\n\nTrump's appearance in Milwaukee Tuesday will take place at Discovery World, a science museum that juts out into Lake Michigan. The museum's current facility was built in 2006.\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump's running mate and Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance spoke at Discovery World at an event sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ group.\n\nHarris also spoke at Discovery World in May, before she became the Democratic presidential nominee. During that visit, she focused on the economy and disparities that affect Black homeowners and business owners.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nMore:From admission cost to hours to exhibits, here's what to know before a Discovery World visit\n\nTrump to make his first Dane County campaign stop\n\nHundreds of supporters are lined up outside Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee awaiting a visit from Trump. His remarks are scheduled for 1:30 p.m.\n\nIt's Trump's first campaign event in Dane County, Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and a Democratic stronghold. Biden led Trump by more than 181,000 votes in the county when he defeated him statewide by about 21,000 votes in 2020. In Waunakee, Biden led Trump by about 2,600 votes.\n\nDane Manufacturing has served as a friendly space for Republican candidates in the liberal region. Hovde toured the metal fabrication facility and fielded questions from employees about a month ago, and Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz did the same at the company's former location during his 2016 presidential bid. Cruz, who now backs Trump, at the 2016 stop referred to him as a \"sniveling coward.\"\n\nIn his Tuesday speeches, Trump is expected to criticize the current Democratic administration's economic policy.\n\n\"When Wisconsinites send President Trump back to the White House, he will lower input costs for our farmers, cut 10 regulations for each new regulation implemented, and help, not hurt, farmers\u2019 ability to feed the world,\" the Trump campaign said in a news release promoting the campaign events.\n\n\"While Kamala Harris desperately tries to run from her four years of failure for farmers, workers, and families across the state, Wisconsinites know that only President Trump can Make America Wealthy, Safe, Strong, and Great Again,\" the news release said.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nHarris planning Fox Valley campaign stop Thursday in Wisconsin\n\nHarris will be returning to Wisconsin on Thursday to rally voters in the Fox Valley. The campaign hasn't yet confirmed her travel plans, but a Wisconsin Democrats advisory with a registration link went out to voters.\n\nHarris was last in Wisconsin in late September for a rally in Madison. The Fox Valley visit would be Harris' first to northeastern Wisconsin. Trump rallied in Green Bay in April for his first campaign stop of 2024, and running mate JD Vance was in De Pere recently.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat do the latest Trump-Harris polls show in Wisconsin?\n\nA new Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters will be released Wednesday afternoon, right in the middle of this week of campaign visits. The poll is considered one of the highest-quality surveys in the country.\n\nThe last poll, conducted between Aug. 28 and Sept. 5, showed Harris with a four-point lead over Trump. That was within the margin of error, as have been most Marquette polls this year in battleground Wisconsin.\n\nThe last poll also showed an important switch for Harris: For the first time, she led among voters who consider themselves \"very enthusiastic\" to vote. Harris closed an enthusiasm gap that presented problems for Biden, then pulled ahead of Trump in the latest poll.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nAbout 462,000 absentee ballots have been requested in Wisconsin\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5, but voting is well underway in Wisconsin. According to Sept. 30 data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, 461,704 voters have requested mail-in absentee ballots. About 87,000 of them have been returned by voters.\n\nEarly voting, which provides an opportunity to cast an absentee ballot at an in-person location, runs from Oct. 22 to Nov. 3 in Wisconsin. It's up to each city, town or village to decide how many dates, times and locations to offer.\n\nYou can register to vote, request an absentee ballot, look up what's on your ballot, find your polling place and more at myvote.wi.gov.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp"

        "article_content": "Far beyond the eight familiar planets in our solar system, countless bizarre and extreme worlds await discovery \u2014 and some have already been found.\n\nThanks to rapidly advancing telescope technology, astronomers have detected more than 5,600 planets outside our solar system. These exoplanets , as scientists call them, are worlds of lava, and worlds of water. They're worlds being ravaged by the heat of their stars, and worlds locked in eternal night. There are worlds that look like they were stolen straight from \"Star Wars,\" and worlds that may hold exotic forms of life never dreamed up in science fiction.\n\nJoin us as we tour some of the strangest and most fascinating exoplanets in our ever-surprising universe.\n\nThe \"hell planet\" where it rains lava\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\n55 Cancri e is a rocky world about eight times the size of Earth, making it a type of exoplanet known as a \"super Earth.\" Despite its ample size, nothing is \"super\" about the living conditions here. Often nicknamed the \"hell planet,\" 55 Cancri e is completely covered in flowing seas of lava, and it may even rain lava there as well. The exoplanet is located 41 light-years from Earth, making it a popular target for studies (but not for summer getaways).\n\nRelated: 38 jaw-dropping James Webb Space Telescope images\n\nThe water world with (potentially) living oceans\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))\n\nK2-18 b is a large world located about 120 light-years from the sun. It inhabits the \"Goldilocks zone\" around its star, meaning that liquid water (and potentially life) could exist there. A recent analysis with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) supports the idea that the exoplanet may have its own liquid water ocean \u2014 and that the ocean may be home to living creatures . In the study, JWST detected possible traces of dimethyl sulfide, a chemical known to be emitted only by phytoplankton on Earth, in the exoplanet's atmosphere.\n\nThe real-world \"Tatooine\"\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nLuke Skywalker would feel right at home on Kepler-16b . This exoplanet is the first known circumbinary planet \u2014 a planet that orbits two stars at the same time, just like Tatooine from the Star Wars franchise. However, because this huge planet has a gassy surface similar to Saturn's, even a Jedi would have a hard time finding their footing on this exoplanet, which is located about 200 light-years from the sun.\n\nThe rule-breaking behemoth\n\n(Image credit: Penn State)\n\nThe giant exoplanet LHS 3154b has scientists scratching their heads, because it seems far too large for its tiny star. This planet, which is about 13 times more massive than Earth but orbits a star nine times less massive than the sun, doesn't seem like it could exist, researchers said upon its discovery in 2023. Future studies of this \"impossible\" world could upend the known rules of planet formation.\n\nThe largest exoplanet in the known universe?\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nWith twice the radius of Jupiter, the exoplanet HAT-P-67 b may be the largest known planet in the universe , in terms of width. But despite its monumental girth, there are more massive worlds out there. This honkin' world, located about 1,200 light-years from Earth, has a very low density, giving it only about one-third the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThe \"fluffy\" planet where it rains sand\n\n(Image credit: Illustration: LUCA School of Arts, Belgium/ Klaas Verpoest (visuals), Johan Van Looveren (typography). Science: Achr\u00e8ne Dyrek (CEA and Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, France), Michiel Min (SRON, the Netherlands), Leen Decin (KU Leuven, Belgium) / European MIRI EXO GTO team / ESA / NASA)\n\nLocated 200 light-years from Earth, the exoplanet WASP-107b also has a very low density, making it appear \"fluffy\" in telescope observations. A recent JWST study of the planet revealed clouds potentially made of fine-grained silicate particles, meaning it may literally rain sand on this puffed-up world.\n\nThe \"eyeball planet\" with potentially living seas\n\n(Image credit: BENOIT GOUGEON, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE MONTR\u00c9AL)\n\nSitting just 50 light-years from Earth, the beady-eyed exoplanet LHS 1140 b may be a candidate for alien life thanks to its one-of-a-kind surface. Scientists studying the world with JWST found that the planet may be covered in ice \u2014 except for the one part of its surface that permanently points toward its host star. Here, the star's heat may melt just enough ice for a circular, liquid water ocean to form, according to the researchers. Besides giving the planet a distinct bull's-eye appearance, this rare ocean may be a prime place for extraterrestrial life to flourish, the team wrote.\n\nThe rotten-egg world\n\n(Image credit: Roberto Molar Candanosa/Johns Hopkins Univeristy)\n\nThe exoplanet HD 189733 b , located about 64 light-years from Earth, has a chemical composition so distinct that astronomers can practically smell it from across the galaxy. A recent JWST study of the planet found that its atmosphere contains significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide \u2014 a toxic and flammable gas given off by decaying organic matter and volcanoes on Earth \u2014 which smells like rotten eggs. The smelly egg planet is far too hot for life to exist (thank goodness), but the mere fact that scientists can detect such distinct molecules in its atmosphere is a good sign that JWST may soon be able to detect signatures of life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe \"Vulcan planet\" that may not exist\n\n(Image credit: NASA/Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nIn a remarkable case of science fiction reflected in reality, scientists have reported the discovery of a planet similar to Vulcan, the home world of Dr. Spock in the Star Trek franchise. The planet was discovered in 2018 around the real star 40 Eridani A \u2014 the very same star that hosts Spock's home planet in the famous sci-fi series. However, recent follow-up observations of the star have called the planet's existence into question; subtle wobbles in the star's light signature may result not from a nearby planet's tugging on it but rather from regular eruptions on the star's surface. The existence of the Vulcan planet, named HD 26965 b, now seems in doubt.\n\nThe Earth-like planet around a small, red star\n\n(Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nEarth may have a long-lost twin in a nearby star system. Named Gliese 12 b , the planet orbits a hot, red star in a system roughly 40 light-years from Earth. Remarkably, the exoplanet appears to have a width 1.1 times that of Earth, giving it similar properties to our own planet. And while Gliese 12 b orbits its home star much more closely than our planet does the sun (one year there lasts about 13 Earth days), that star is also much smaller, keeping the planet in the habitable zone where liquid water can form on the planet's surface. That means our distant twin may even have its own version of life.\n\nThe Earth-size planet with eternal night\n\n(Image credit: Lionel Garcia)\n\nNot all Earth-size planets are lucky enough to be habitable. Take SPECULOOS-3 b, a rocky, Earth-like world whose orbit around its red dwarf star is a little too close for comfort. Completing an orbit every 17 hours, the rocky world is exposed to so much radiation that its atmosphere was likely blasted away long ago, leaving the unlucky planet totally barren. The roasting temperatures aren't a global phenomenon, however; this planet is tidally locked, meaning one side always faces its star in eternal day, while the other side sits in perpetual night.\n\nThe red volcano world that's \"melting from within\"\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Dani Player)\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet in a distant star system that appears to be erupting with so many volcanoes, the world literally glows red when seen through telescopes. The smoldering exoplanet, named TOI-6713.01 , is located roughly 66 light-years from Earth and orbits its star closely, completing a loop every 2.2 Earth days. Observations suggest the planet is covered in molten lava, released by hundreds of active volcanoes. The planet is also subject to incredible internal friction from the gravity of its star and its neighboring planets, which may be causing the world to literally melt from within.\n\nThe gas giant with bullet-like wind\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf Crawford (STScI))\n\nScientists have mapped the weather on an enormous exoplanet 280 light-years from Earth, and the forecast looks grim. The planet, named WASP-43b , is tidally locked, with one massive face always pointing toward its star and the other cloaked in eternal darkness. Significant temperature differences between the two sides drive fierce winds, which scientists estimated to blow at up to 5,600 mph (9,000 km/h) \u2014 several times faster than a speeding bullet.\n\nThe hellish world with glorious rainbows\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nThe exoplanet WASP-76 b \u2014 located about 637 light-years from Earth \u2014 is not the type of place you'd want to vacation. Orbiting 20 times closer to its home star than Mercury orbits the sun, the planet's dayside is estimated to reach 4,350 degrees Fahrenheit (2,400 degrees Celsius), making it a true hell world. There is one draw, however: A strange bright spot observed on the planet's surface, right where the day and night sides meet, could be a \"glory\" \u2014 a rare visual phenomenon, sometimes seen on Earth, made up of concentric rainbow rings forming a giant circle.\n\nThe giant planets orbiting dead stars\n\n(Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nOne day, the sun will die \u2014 but some planets in our solar system may live on. Scientists made this inference after discovering two enormous planets orbiting \"dead\" white dwarf stars in distant star systems. Named WD 1202-232 and WD 2105-82 , the planets are estimated to be between one and seven times as massive as Jupiter, and both orbit small, dead stars at distances of at least 11.5 times that between Earth and the sun. Their discovery, if confirmed, hints that our solar system's comparable planets, Jupiter and Saturn, may be able to survive the inevitable death of the sun one day. (Earth, sadly, is likely to be swallowed up during our star's final expansion.)\n\nThe \"rogue\" planets of Orion\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA / Science leads and image processing: M. McCaughrean, S. Pearson, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO)\n\nMost known planets orbit stars, but there may be countless others that don't. Scientists using the JWST have discovered hundreds of free-floating \"rogue planets\" zooming through the Orion Nebula, untethered to any star. Strangely, about 80 of these rogue worlds are trapped in binary orbits with each other, tumbling through space in pairs. Scientists are not certain how these worlds got ejected from their home star systems or why they are trapped in binary orbits. Given that these planets are roughly as massive as Jupiter, scientists have dubbed them Jupiter-mass binary objects \u2014 or JuMBOs, for short.\n\nThe distant planet we can actually see\n\n(Image credit: ESO)\n\nScientists detect most exoplanets indirectly, by watching changes in the light emitted by distant stars. But in 2004, researchers got direct visual confirmation of an alien world for the first time ever. Called 2M1207b, the exoplanet is located about 170 light-years away, in the constellation Centaurus, and is a gas giant about five times more massive than Jupiter. The team spotted the distant world by looking at it in three different infrared wave bands, which helped reveal the planet's heat while blocking the light of its home star. Since this groundbreaking discovery, roughly 200 exoplanets have been discovered through direct imaging, while more than 5,000 others have been revealed through other means.\n\nThe planet with clouds of quartz\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, and R. Crawford (STScI))\n\nCan you imagine a sunset filtered through a crystal sky? That may be a reality on the exoplanet WASP-17b , a Jupiter-like gas giant that's so hot that its clouds are made of quartz crystals, observations with JWST suggest. The planet orbits extremely close to its home star, giving it an atmosphere with temperatures reaching a blistering 2,700 F (1,500 C). This heat forms tiny, sand-size silica particles in the planet's atmosphere, which may coalesce into clouds of pure quartz, researchers suggest.\n\nThe baby Jupiter about to be born\n\n(Image credit: ESO/ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/Weber et al.)\n\nExoplanet-hunting scientists zoom in on not just existing worlds but also worlds that are about to be born . While studying the region around the star V960 Mon, located about 5,000 light-years from Earth, scientists spotted a clumpy field of gas where two tendrils of material are apparently being funneled into distinct, planet-like lumps. According to the researchers, who made the discovery using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, this is the first time scientists have imaged a young star system on the verge of birthing its first giant planets.\n\nThe sibling planets dancing in lockstep\n\n(Image credit: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/Balsalobre-Ruza et al.)\n\nAround the distant star PDS 70, located 370 light-years from Earth, resides an incredibly rare pair of sibling planets . One fully formed world roughly the size of Jupiter appears to swirl around its host star; behind it, in the same orbit, is an enormous cloud of gas and dust that researchers suspect may be the planet's partially formed sibling. Although only one of the objects seems to be a full-fledged planet, the pair is the first evidence of rare \"Trojan planets\" \u2014 two worlds that formed at nearly the same time, in roughly the same place around their home star, moving in the exact same orbit.\n\nThe planet turning its star into a \"spiral galaxy\"\n\n(Image credit: ESO)\n\nAbout 500 million light-years from Earth is a star system that looks suspiciously familiar. Wrapped in two dusty spiral arms , it resembles our own Milky Way galaxy \u2014 although on a much, much smaller scale. The reason for this star's galactic appearance? Astronomers suspect it's because of a hidden, Jupiter-size planet dubbed MWC 758 c, which used its massive gravitational pull to sculpt the star's sheath of dust into spectacular spiral arms. The planet has yet to be fully confirmed, but simulations show it's a likely cause of its home star's odd look.\n\nThe mirror world that shouldn't exist\n\n(Image credit: ESA/Cheops)\n\nMost planets reflect at least a bit of their home star's light. But the exoplanet LTT9779 b reflects a whopping 80% of its star's incoming rays \u2014 the highest reflectiveness of any planet ever discovered. The key to the planet's impressive albedo is a layer of metallic clouds that surrounds it. Scientists suspect the Neptune-size world's sky is mostly full of silicate, or glass, and titanate, a salt containing titanium \u2014 turning the planet's atmosphere into a veritable mirror. The planet's existence poses a puzzle for scientists: The world orbits so closely to its star that its atmosphere should have been blown away by now. The key to its survival may be the metal in the planet's skies, which may be too heavy for solar wind to blast it away.\n\nThe \"zombie\" planet that survived its star's death\n\n(Image credit: W. M. Keck Observatory/Adam Makarenko)\n\nThe exoplanet 8 Ursae Minoris b , also known as Halla, is a hot, Jupiter-like world located 520 light-years from Earth. Observations suggest the massive world should have been completely incinerated by its home star, which has already entered its red giant phase and appears to have long since ballooned outward into its system, scorching everything in its path, before shrinking back to its current size. The fact that Halla orbits relatively close to the star suggests it was either born after the star shrank again or the star that's visible today is one of two binary stars that merged, preventing either one from expanding on its path of destruction.\n\nThe water world with a steam atmosphere\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nThe exoplanet GJ 1214b is located just 40 light-years from Earth, but it's coated in so many thick clouds that scientists had a hard time studying it until recently. Using JWST's infrared vision to peer through the clouds, scientists analyzed the planet and saw what appeared to be an atmosphere made of steam, suggesting the world below may contain significant amounts of water.\n\nThe Earth-like planet with no atmosphere\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, J. Olmsted (STScI))\n\nAround the distant star TRAPPIST-1, seven rocky, Earth-size planets swirl through the star's habitable zone. Whether any of these planets contain the right conditions for life is a question astronomers are eagerly investigating. But one of them, TRAPPIST-1b , may be officially out of the running. JWST's observations of the rocky, Earth-like world reveal that the planet is about as hot as an oven \u2014 a whopping 450 F (232 C) \u2014 and almost certainly doesn't have an atmosphere. Some of the scorching world's neighbors may be better positioned for life to emerge, but more research is needed to know for sure.\n\nThe extraterrestrial sandstorm planet\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))\n\nScientists using JWST have spotted a gargantuan sandstorm raging on the exoplanet VHS 1256 b , located roughly 40 light-years from Earth. An enormous world that's far from its star, the \"super-Jupiter\" takes about 10,000 years to complete a single orbit. That large distance means scientists can see the planet's atmosphere relatively clearly, without too much starlight getting in the way. Recent observations showed incredibly hot clouds made of silicate particles swirling through the planet's atmosphere. According to the researchers, this may be evidence of a gargantuan dust storm.\n\nThe planet hotter than a star\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nKELT-9b is an extremely hot, Jupiter-like planet located 670 light-years from Earth. With an estimated surface temperature of 7,800 F (4,300 C), it was deemed the hottest exoplanet ever discovered upon its detection and is even hotter than some stars. This intense heat has a nasty impact on the planet's atmosphere: On KELT-9b's dayside, the heat of the nearby star beats down so intensely that hydrogen molecules in KELT-9b's atmosphere are literally ripped to shreds and blown across the planet. With one-half of the planet's atmosphere constantly melting, this world is one extraterrestrial destination you'd definitely want to avoid.\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, and J. Olmsted (STScI))\n\nLocated about 900 light-years from Earth, the exoplanet WASP-121b is so hot that heavy metals are constantly boiling through its atmosphere and venting into space. Scientists spotted iron and magnesium molecules so high above the planet's surface that they could escape the pull of gravity and drift away. The extreme heat comes from the planet's ultraclose proximity to its host star. The planet is so close, in fact, that tidal forces generated by the star's gravity have stretched the planet into a football shape that distinguishes it from the spherical worlds most often discovered.\n\nThe ultrasmall world moving at breakneck speed\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nLocated 35 light-years from Earth, L 98-59b is one of the smallest exoplanets ever discovered, with a mass just 0.4 times that of Earth. The tiny world also rockets around its home star at breakneck speed, completing an orbit in just two days, six hours. Because of this, the planet receives roughly 22 times as much energy from its home star as Earth does from the sun, almost certainly rendering the tiny, fast-moving planet uninhabitable.\n\nEarth's \"older cousin\"\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe exoplanet Kepler-452 b appears so similar to our home planet that NASA has dubbed the world \"Earth's older cousin.\" The rocky exoplanet orbits a sunlike star at virtually the same distance that our planet orbits the sun, with a year there lasting about 384 days. That puts the planet firmly in the habitable zone, where liquid water could form on its surface. Sadly, our cousin will remain estranged for a good while longer: At nearly 1,800 light-years from Earth, the planet would take at least 30 million years to reach by spacecraft.\n\nThe bizarrely close sibling planets\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe exoplanet Kepler-36b is a rocky world that's about 1.5 times the size of Earth and orbits bizarrely close to its neighboring world, the Neptune-like exoplanet Kepler-36c. The two alien worlds make extremely close approaches to each other every 97 days, on average; during those cosmic family reunions, the two planets are separated by less than five Earth-moon distances. These ultraclose encounters exert tremendous tidal forces on the sibling planets, possibly promoting active volcanism on the rocky Kepler-36b.\n\nThe unlucky planet around a toddler star\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))"

Remains of tiny crustaceans embedded in the fur also indicate the woolly rhino (Coelodonta antiquitatis) died in a shallow pool of water, the team noted.\n\nRadiocarbon dating suggests the young woolly rhino died and froze more than 32,000 years ago.\n\nWoolly rhinos roamed the Arctic tundra between 460,000 and 12,000 years ago , during the last ice age . They were huge beasts and the second largest herbivores in the mammoth steppe ecosystem after woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius). Like mammoths, woolly rhinos were well-adapted to the cold climate thanks to their coat of shaggy fur \u2014 but scientists still know very little about these prehistoric animals, according to the study.\n\nRelated: 'Closer than people think': Woolly mammoth 'de-extinction' is nearing reality \u2014 and we have no idea what happens next\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They dubbed the animal \"Abyisky rhinoceros\" after the local district and sent its remains to the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha, where the carcass currently sits in a freezer.\n\nFor the new study, researchers temporarily defrosted the carcass and took samples of skin, fur and soft tissue for analysis. They also examined the woolly rhino's teeth, measured the length of one of its horns and noted the size of a large hump on its back, which appeared to be filled with fat.\n\nIllustration of a woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). (Image credit: De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\nThe horn was 9.4 inches (24 centimeters) long and presented three to four dark patches that typically correspond to the number of years lived by a rhinoceros, according to the study. The height at the shoulder of the carcass was close to 4.3 feet (130 cm). Together, this indicates the woolly rhino was 4 to 4.5 years old when it died and hadn't reached sexual maturity.\n\nIts fur was darker than that of a smaller woolly rhino calf discovered in 2014 in the same district. That calf, named \"Sasha,\" was frozen for at least 10,000 years and covered in thin, almost-blond hair . In contrast, adult woolly rhinos that were previously pulled from the ice have coarse, dark brown fur.\n\n\"The fur of the Abyisky rhinoceros has a uniform light brown color due to the combination of white, beige, and brown hair,\" the researchers wrote in the study. \"The coat is darker on the ears and feet and lighter on the back, belly, and hind legs.\"\n\nRemarkably, the Abyisky rhinoceros also had a 5-inch-high (13 cm) hump filled with fatty mass on its back, the likes of which scientists had never seen on a woolly rhino carcass. Fatty humps are relatively common in Arctic animals, Love Dal\u00e9n , a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, told CNN . They evolved to beat the cold and store energy for when times get tough, he said.\n\nThe newly discovered 4-year-old appears to represent an intermediate stage of woolly rhino development. Specimens with preserved tissues like this one are invaluable for further research, and particularly for genetic tests that cannot be done on bones, Dal\u00e9n said."

And it could redefine our understanding of Earth\u2019s geological history.\n\nA Fossilized Record in Earth\u2019s Mantle\n\nGeologists, led by postdoctoral researcher Jingchuan Wang, used seismic imaging techniques to probe deep into the mantle, the layer between Earth\u2019s crust and core. It\u2019s almost like a CT scan of the Earth that shows a cross-section view of our planet\u2019s interior. In the process, they discovered a thickened section of the mantle transition zone, located about 410 to 660 kilometers below the Earth\u2019s surface. This zone separates the upper and lower mantles and can expand or contract based on temperature.\n\nWang describes this discovery as a \u201cfossilized fingerprint\u201d of an ancient seafloor that subducted during the Triassic period. Subduction is a process where one tectonic plate slides beneath another, which typically consumes slabs of oceanic crust entirely. Yet, in this case, the ancient slab remains trapped deep within the mantle, providing an unprecedented glimpse into the Earth\u2019s geological past.\n\nA CT Scan of the Earth\n\nTo make this discovery, Wang\u2019s team used seismic waves \u2014 vibrations caused by earthquakes \u2014 to create cross-sectional maps of the Earth\u2019s interior. By tracking how these waves traveled through different layers (each layer has a different signal), they detected the subducted slab in the mantle beneath the East Pacific Rise, a tectonic boundary on the floor of the southeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis seismic \u201cscan\u201d revealed not only the ancient subduction slab but also the surprising behavior of the material in this region. It was sinking at about half the speed researchers had expected.\n\nThe team\u2019s discovery suggests that the mantle transition zone can act as a barrier, slowing the movement of subducted material through the Earth. Wang believes that the unusually thick area they identified contains colder material, which may explain why some oceanic slabs may become stuck in the transition zone rather than sinking further into the lower mantle.\n\n\u201cOur discovery opens up new questions about how the deep Earth influences what we see on the surface across vast distances and timescales,\u201d Wang noted.\n\nNew Questions About Deep Earth Structures\n\nCredit: Jingchuan Wang et al.\n\nThis discovery offers new clues about the behavior of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP). It\u2019s a giant, continent-sized zone, sitting about 2,900 kilometers beneath the surface, where seismic waves travel at a much slower rate than in the surrounding mantle. But what makes this region truly puzzling is how little we understand about it, despite its profound role in shaping our planet\u2019s behavior. The newly found slab may provide a key to understanding this complex structure.\n\nGeodynamic simulations also suggest that ancient slabs like the one found under the East Pacific Rise may interact with deep mantle structures called super plumes, rising columns of hot rock that feed volcanic hotspots like the one under Hawaii. Another plume is believed to be fueling the volcanic activity beneath the Easter Islands.\n\nLooking ahead, Wang and his team plan to expand their research, mapping other ancient subduction zones across the Pacific Ocean and beyond. \u201cWe believe there are many more ancient structures waiting to be discovered in Earth\u2019s deep interior,\u201d Wang said. \u201cEach one has the potential to reveal new insights about our planet\u2019s complex past \u2014 and even help us understand other planets beyond our own.\u201d\n\nA New Chapter in Earth\u2019s History\n\nThis discovery rewrites part of Earth\u2019s story, revealing a hidden chapter in the planet\u2019s evolution. As scientists continue to probe deeper into the Earth\u2019s mantle, these ancient slabs could unlock long-lost secrets about how the Earth formed and how its tectonic plates have moved over millions of years.\n\nThe remnants of this ancient seafloor might be the first of many yet-to-be-discovered slabs lurking deep within our planet, waiting to tell their stories. As such, this research marks a significant step toward uncovering these mysteries, bridging the gap between deep-Earth structures and the planet\u2019s surface geology.\n\nIn Wang\u2019s words, \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe findings appeared in the journal Science Advances."

But what causes air to move in the first place? That is where it gets interesting.\n\nA world without wind\n\nPicture a world that was completely flat and motionless. This world has no changes in elevation, no changes in surface material (land vs. oceans etc). In this theoretical and boring world, the sun would heat each area exactly the same. This would be a world without wind.\n\nRelated: What is dew point?\n\nHow high and low pressure relate to wind\n\nThankfully, Earth is vastly different. We live on a constantly rotating, tilting sphere with large variations in land elevation and vast oceans. The sun heats each of these areas differently and therefore unevenly. This differential heating creates areas of high and low pressure, something we call the pressure gradient force.\n\nAir is constantly flowing from high pressure areas to lower pressure areas in an effort to balance out.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThe Coriolis Force\n\nAir doesn't flow in a direct line from high to low pressure. Instead it is curved due to something called the Coriolis Force.\n\nThe Coriolis Force is caused by the Earth's rotation, and it directs air to flow clockwise around high pressure and counter-clockwise around low pressure.\n\nAir is also moving in a vertical direction. Areas of high pressure are characterized by sinking air, which tends to warm and lead to sunny, pleasant weather. In low pressure areas, the air rises, cools and condenses into clouds, leading to storms.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere all of those directions are reversed."

        "article_content": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 It doesn\u2019t feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of Caracas, the capital, woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country.\n\nWorkers rushed to set up decorations in various neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible because it\u2019s October,\u201d said Desir\u00e9 Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. \u201cHalloween hasn\u2019t even passed, and it\u2019s already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?\u201d\n\nVenezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country\u2019s economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election .\n\n\u201cIf they start paying... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won\u2019t have anything left in December,\u201d Aguiar lamented. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really bad idea.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on Sept. 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever.\n\nMockery followed Maduro\u2019s decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision \u2014 another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro\u2019s predecessor , the late leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda.\n\nMaduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed.\n\nMaduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro\u2019s decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons.\n\n\u201cChristmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d Wilfredo Guti\u00e9rrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas.\n\n\u201cThe one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.\u201d\n\n___"

        "article_content": "Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], October 1: Gartner Digital Markets\u2013 the world\u2019s largest platform for finding software and services, including Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice, and UpCity\u2013recently convened the Insights Summit in India\u2019s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, Karnataka, to address the SaaS industry\u2019s pressing challenges. After a year of economic uncertainty, SaaS leaders seek innovative strategies to find efficient growth and secure their place on software buyer shortlists.\n\nThe Insights Summit featured a distinguished panel of speakers from Gartner Digital Markets, including Narayan Adeeb, VP of India Operations; Pit Rissiek, VP of Sales APAC and EMEA; and Saby Khanduja, Senior Sales Manager. Joining them on stage were SaaS leaders Dhivya Venkatesan, Head of Marketing at Sign easy, and Abhigna Kashyap, Senior Director and Global Head of Brand Content, and Social Media at LTI Mindtree.\n\nThe conference theme was \u201cSecuring Your Spot on Buyer Shortlists.\u201d The Insights Summit brought together 68 industry experts and thought leaders to provide actionable insights and best practices for SaaS businesses. Participants learned about the latest software buyer trends, emerging technologies, and effective marketing strategies to drive growth.\n\nThe event featured exclusive research that surveyed 3,500 software buyers and company decision-makers. The study focused on the challenges of software selection, the latest AI trends and buyer preferences, and strategies for software providers to optimise their performance on the Gartner Digital Markets platform.

India is the most confident of the countries surveyed, planning to increase its spending by 89%. Top priorities for software purchase are Cybersecurity (37%), IT management (31%), and AI (31%).\n\n* Customer reviews: Customer reviews are buyers\u2019 most influential information source for narrowing their initial purchase options and creating a shortlist of products (41%). Final purchase decisions are made predominantly after product trials (62%) and impressions made by the vendor\u2019s customer support (57%).\n\n* Buyer regret: Over half of companies have experienced regret over a technology purchase in the last year. The more a buyer relies solely on information from a vendor to buy software, the more often they experience regret.

        "article_content": "Motorola may be catching up to companies like Samsung and Google regarding the number of years of Android updates it provides for its smartphones. A new Motorola phone could come with five years of updates, and it represents the second Motorola phone to do so in as many months.\n\nThe recently announced Motorola Moto G75 will come with five Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. By our count, this would mean that users will be able to update their phone to at least Android 19, considering that the Moto G75 ships with Android 14. Last month, it was announced that the Motorola Edge 50 Neo would include five years of OS upgrades and security patches.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile five years of updates isn\u2019t as many as the seven years that companies like Samsung and Google promise, it still represents a significant increase from what Motorola had previously offered.\n\nMotorola confirms this update guarantee on its product page for the Moto G75, writing: \u201cKeep up with the latest version of Android by getting five OS upgrades \u2014 and six years of security updates \u2014 guaranteed through 2029.\u201d\n\nThe Motorola Moto G75 is a midrange smartphone with impressive features at its price point. It includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, a 6.78-inch Full HD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, and support for expandable storage via a microSD card of up to 1TB.\n\nThe new phone also boasts a 50-megapixel main primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and Quad Pixel technology and a 5,000mAh battery that supports 30-watt TurboPower wired and 15W wireless charging.\n\nThe new phone is available in Charcoal Gray, Aqua Blue, and Succulent Green. The Charcoal Gray model features a matte-finished back cover, while the Aqua Blue and Succulent Green models have vegan leather rear panels.\n\nIt looks like a very competent budget phone, though the real interest lies in its update policy. This is an area Motorola has long struggled with, and while it remains to be seen if the company actually makes good on this promise, it\u2019s a very encouraging step in the right direction.\n\nMotorola has not yet announced the pricing and availability details for the Moto G75."
