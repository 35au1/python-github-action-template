While it\u2019s certainly not the first time someone reported seeing strange flying objects in the sky over San Antonio, it\u2019s an unusually clear video of what folks believe to be a UFO.\n\nA TikTok user shared a video of a mysterious rotating object hovering in the sky off North Alamo Street in Downtown San Antonio. While it appeared metallic or white in the video, the TikTok poster, Justin Delgado, says it nearly blended in with the darkest part of the sky.\n\nWhen the video was shared on Reddit, several commenters noted they\u2019ve been seeing mysterious objects in the sky more frequently as of late. Some said reports or quickly cropping up in New Mexico, Arizona and across the globe while other say they\u2019ve seen suspicious activity in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI seen it all the way from Lacoste,\u201d Reddit user Historical_Wish_7627 commented. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing lots of weird stuff in the sky lately.\u201d\n\nAnother Reddit poster who lives in a rural area outside San Antonio reported seeing what looked like a satellite moving across the sky one night that faded into the night sky. The same poster says they saw a pair of mysterious lights, which they say wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane, hovering over the Alamo City.\n\nOthers were quick to quips on the speculation of aliens visiting San Antonio. In reference to a recent video of a mattress flying down a highway in the city, having dislodged off the back of a fast-moving pickup truck, Reddit users joked the mattress had made it into airspace.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe highway mattress has breached containment,\u201d Reddit user audientix posted, with many responding with their own jokes about the mattress being the sources of the conspiracy. There were plenty of other jokes to be made on the thread without reference to a mattress, though.\n\n\u201cThat was abuela\u2019s chancla after whooping you so hard it was sent into orbit,\u201d Reddit user Chiken_97 wrote."

While many users appreciate the feature\u2019s convenience, many others prefer to turn off AI overviews because AI results need to be double-checked for accuracy, often defeating the purpose of a Google Search. Google understands the need to make it easier to cross-check and verify AI overview results, and it could soon make it easier to do so by listing all the sources and related content that make up the AI overview summary in Gemini results.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhen you search using Gemini in the Google app and receive an AI Overview response, you can check the AI result for its sources. However, doing so involves using the Google \u201cG\u201d icon at the bottom of every answer, which then uses Google Search to find similar content. This is what this process looks like at the moment:\n\nThe latest Google app v15.47.28 beta appears to be testing the addition of links to relevant web pages directly within the text result of AI Overviews in Gemini results. Google had mentioned this change for AI Overviews in August but did not mention it for the Google app. We managed to activate the feature in the Google app, and here\u2019s how it would appear.\n\nThe expand icon at the bottom right (next to the Source and Related Content section) shows a list of all the sources and related content from different websites, as seen in the third screenshot above.\n\nThis is similar in approach to how Google\u2019s AI overviews on the web appear on your mobile device, which is shown below for reference:\n\nAamir Siddiqui / Android Authority\n\nThis UI for additional sourcing is not currently live within the Google app for Android. We don\u2019t know if and when Google will go ahead with the change. However, given how the approach aligns with the mobile-web version of AI overviews, we hope to see it go live on Android very soon.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

            "article_content": "An AI-powered 'Death Clock' can 'predict' when you die. (Representational)\n\nA new Artificial Intelligence-powered app is making waves\u2014by predicting the day you will die. Dubbed the Death Clock, the app uses AI to forecast an individual\u2019s lifespan down to the second, leaving users equal parts intrigued and unsettled. But is it a revolutionary health tool or a morbid curiosity?\n\nHow It Works: Science or Speculation?\n\n\n\nAvailable on both Google Play and the Apple Store, the Death Clock app uses data from 1,200 international life expectancy studies covering 53 million participants. It incorporates health markers such as cholesterol levels, blood sugar, workout routines, water intake, and even the quality of personal relationships to make its predictions. Developers claim the app\u2019s insights are backed by research from authoritative sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBrent Franson, the app's developer, argues that it goes beyond morbid fascination. \"Death Clock is not just to scare you. We give you an evaluation of your health,\" Franson said in an interview with DailyMail. He explained that the app combines traditional longevity data with advanced AI algorithms, drawing from studies by health and life insurance companies. \u201cWe added an AI layer on top of the best-in-class methodologies,\u201d Franson said.\n\nUsers are encouraged to answer questions honestly to get accurate results. Queries range from health-focused\u2014like daily sugar intake and cardio frequency\u2014to personal, such as the age of one\u2019s grandparents and the state of mental health. The results? A digital grim reaper delivering your death sentence, complete with causes like cancer or cardiovascular disease and a countdown clock ticking away.\n\nWhile some users see the app as a wake-up call to improve their lifestyles, others are less enthused. One X user sarcastically remarked, \"Just what I needed\u2014an app to tell me that my late-night taco runs are slowly killing me!\" Another joked, \"Forget motivation talks, I\u2019ve got the AI Death Clock counting down my calories and life.\"\n\nAlongside death predictions, it provides personalised recommendations to extend life. For instance, one user reported that incorporating weightlifting and increasing cardio could add three years to their lifespan. The app highlights the role of muscle health and metabolic stability, with Franson advising users to make the most of its free trial. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a more important date in your life than the day that you\u2019re going to die,\u201d he quipped.\n\nWhat Sets It Apart?\n\nThe Death Clock claims to outperform standard life tables, which actuaries and demographers commonly use. Life tables predict population-level life expectancy but lack the individual-specific nuance the Death Clock offers. By incorporating stress management, nutrition, and mental health into its algorithm, the app aims to show that death dates aren\u2019t set in stone.\n\nFor those willing to pay, the app offers detailed longevity plans via monthly ($15) or annual ($60) subscriptions. The free three-day trial allows users to explore basic predictions and advice."

It\u2019s not a horror game, so to speak, but \u2013 drenched in atmosphere and oozing creative creatures \u2013 it\u2019s a haunting and engrossing location to search and slice your way through.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to ignore Enigma of Fear\u2019s beautiful art design, seamlessly blending pixel art sprites with old-school-style 3D environments.

Nearly two decades later, the family\u2019s wild ride hasn\u2019t stopped, but what are the famous foursome up to now? In 2002, The Osbournes premiered, offering an unfiltered look into the lives of rock legend Ozzy Osbourne, his no-nonsense wife Sharon, and their two youngest children, Jack and Kelly. The series was an instant hit, blending chaotic family moments with the wild charm of its eccentric stars. Though the series wrapped in 2005, the Osbourne family has remained a staple in pop culture, cementing their place as one of the most recognisable families in entertainment. Now, 19 years since the show ended, the Osbournes continue to evolve and stay in the spotlight. From Ozzy\u2019s enduring battles with health challenges and Sharon\u2019s bold media career to Kelly\u2019s transformation and Jack\u2019s paranormal pursuits, the family\u2019s story proves they\u2019re far from slowing down. Here\u2019s what each member has been up to since the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nRead More... Kelly Osbourne claims producer said she was too fat for TV after denying Ozempic [LATEST]\n\nOzzy revealed he is battling a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis\n\nOzzy Osbourne In the years following the reality show\u2019s finale, Ozzy reunited with Black Sabbath for a triumphant run, including the 13 album release in 2013 and The End farewell tour in 2017, which closed a historic chapter for the band. During this period, he also found success alongside his son Jack on their travel documentary series, Ozzy & Jack\u2019s World Detour, offering fans an intimate and quirky look at their father-son relationship. However, 2016 brought personal turmoil when reports emerged of an affair with Ozzy\u2019s hairstylist. This revelation led to a brief separation from Sharon, his wife of over 33 years. Despite the challenges, the couple reconciled after Ozzy sought treatment for sex addiction, publicly renewing their vows on Mother\u2019s Day in 2017. In 2019, Ozzy revealed his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis after suffering a severe fall that exacerbated injuries from a 2003 ATV accident. Despite multiple spinal surgeries and mounting health concerns, Ozzy released two successful solo albums. In early 2024, Ozzy shared a hopeful health update, calling his recovery \u201cslow but steady\u201d and attributing his progress to newfound sobriety. Yet, fans were devastated when ongoing health struggles forced him to cancel his much-anticipated Power Trip festival appearance in October.

After the end of The Osbournes in 2005, Sharon continued to thrive as a judge on The X Factor UK and America\u2019s Got Talent. She also hosted her own talk shows and joined The Talk in 2010, where she became a fan favourite in the US until her controversial exit in 2021. Sharon left the show following a heated on-air defence of her friend Piers Morgan over his comments about Meghan Markle, which sparked allegations of racism and homophobia. The couple relocated from LA permanently to England where Sharon briefly hosted The Talk UK on TalkTV but stepped back in 2024 to focus on Ozzy\u2019s health. Sharon has also overcome her own health battles, surviving colorectal cancer in 2002 and undergoing a double mastectomy in 2012 after discovering a genetic risk of breast cancer.\n\nTrending\n\nKelly is now a doting mum to her first child, Sidney\n\nKelly Osbourne Kelly Osbourne, once the rebellious teen of MTV fame, is now a doting mum to her first child, Sidney, born in late 2022. The baby boy\u2019s father is none other than Slipknot DJ Sid Wilson, marking a match made in metal heaven. The pair debuted their romance on the red carpet at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Kelly has been vocal about her sobriety journey, celebrating five years clean in 2024. She\u2019s embraced motherhood wholeheartedly, sharing glimpses of her life with Sidney on social media while balancing appearances in fashion and television. In 2002, Kelly released her own album, Shut Up, and flexed her vocal chops again on The Masked Singer in 2019. She\u2019s a jack of all trades, also authoring her book, There\u2019s No F**king Secret: Letters From a Badass B***h, which was released in 2017. Kelly has also been open about her struggles with both sobriety and weight, opening up about relapsing and fat shaming in late 2021. \"This past year has been the hardest year of my life,\" she wrote on Instagram in at the time. \"I was compliantly and utterly broken. I am still putting myself back together again.\" Career-wise, she made it to third place on Dancing with the Stars in 2009, and starred on Fashion Police for five years from 2010 to 2015.\n\nJack is now a father-of-four and is battling MS"

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking study, scientists from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have made a new discovery that could change malaria and Covid-19 treatment.\n\nThe team from JNU's Special Centre for Molecular Medicine, identified a human protein, Hsp70, as a critical factor in the spread of diseases like malaria and Covid-19.\n\nWorking alongside Russian and Indian researchers, they have also developed a small molecule inhibitor of Hsp70 that could act as a broad-spectrum treatment for multiple infections.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHsp70 (Heat Shock Protein 70) is a type of molecular chaperone, a protein that plays a vital role in helping other proteins fold into their proper shapes and preventing misfolding. The team from JNU's Special Centre for Molecular Medicine. (Photo: Anand Ranganathan)\n\nLed by Professors Anand Ranganathan and Shailja Singh from JNU\u2019s Special Centre for Molecular Medicine, the research suggests that targeting Hsp70 might help prevent drug resistance, a growing problem in treating infections. Their findings have been published in the prestigious International Journal for Biological Macromolecules.\n\nThe team discovered that Hsp70 interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2\u2014the virus responsible for Covid-19\u2014and human ACE2 receptors, which the virus uses to enter cells. They hypothesised that during fever, Hsp70 levels rise and help stabilise this interaction, making it easier for the virus to infect cells. By inhibiting Hsp70, they successfully blocked viral replication in lab tests.\n\nProfessor Singh explained, \"Pathogens like the malaria parasite or SARS-CoV-2 use the host\u2019s machinery to survive. By targeting Hsp70, we can disrupt their ability to replicate and protect themselves from the immune system.\" The team tested the Hsp70 inhibitor, PES-Cl, on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and observed complete viral inhibition at a low dose.\n\nThis host-targeting approach has significant advantages. Unlike traditional drugs that target the virus itself, host-targeting antivirals are less likely to face resistance because the virus cannot mutate the host protein. This method could be particularly effective against rapidly evolving viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, such as Omicron. The team discovered that Hsp70 interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. (Photo: Reuters)\n\nProfessor Ranganathan highlighted the urgency of the research, saying, \"The world may have moved on from Covid-19, but as scientists, we must remain vigilant. Our discovery could help us prepare for future pandemics.\"\n\nOther contributors to the study, including Dr. Pramod Garg of AIIMS and Ph.D. scholar Prerna Joshi, emphasised the importance of collaboration in tackling global health challenges. \"This research could provide a universal tool for managing infectious diseases during emergencies,\" Joshi said.\n\nThe team's efforts shows the critical role of science in pandemic preparedness and highlight the potential for innovative solutions to global health crises.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Dec 3, 2024"

            "article_content": "It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nVan Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.\n\nNone has ever been seen alive at sea.\n\nThe list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.\n\nResearchers studying the 16-foot-long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin are hoping to find that out this week.\n\n\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d\n\nOnly six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.\n\nNew Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.\n\nGet a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area\u2019s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.\n\nDNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.\n\nOn Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.\n\nThe dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.\n\nMembers of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.\n\n\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d\n\nThe iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.\n\n\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nIt\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.\n\nThe assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.\n\n\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

It also highlights roadblocks faced by marketers and product managers while experimenting with the UI, workflows, and functionality across apps and websites.\n\nFor a thorough understanding of the current landscape, this report draws insights from a diverse group of respondents\u2014with data gathered through structured surveys and in-depth interviews\u2014representing organisations with over two million customers across 50+ countries. This includes VPs, CMOs, and product managers ranging from startups to large enterprises across various industries.\n\nWhile 95% of surveyed product managers and 88% of marketers believe that the right user experience is essential for driving customer engagement and retention, many report significant challenges to effectively experimenting with app and web user experiences. Despite recognising its importance, they reported difficulties such as limited resources, data gaps, and technical constraints that hinder their ability to innovate and deliver impactful user experiences.\n\nOther notable findings from the report include:\n\n81.9% of product managers rarely experiment with their app and web experiences before making changes to them. The top challenges quoted include lack of resources ( 46% ), inadequate data and analytics ( 31% ), and technical issues ( 19% )\n\nof product managers rarely experiment with their app and web experiences before making changes to them. The top challenges quoted include lack of resources ( ), inadequate data and analytics ( ), and technical issues ( ) 54% of product managers are unable to support marketers in experimenting with onboarding flows, banner placement, homepage content and other similar app and web experiences.\n\nof product managers are unable to support marketers in experimenting with onboarding flows, banner placement, homepage content and other similar app and web experiences. 81% of marketers believe it would make a significant impact if they could independently experiment with multiple variations of web and app experiences within a no-code framework provided by their product management function.\n\nJacob Joseph, Vice-President - Data Science, at CleverTap, said, \u201cWith consumer expectations constantly rising, brands need to go beyond perfecting their channel strategies and also focus on enhancing the in-app and web experiences to drive results from their marketing efforts. Since all channels ultimately lead users to the app or website, an unsatisfactory experience there can render all your efforts ineffective and become a missed opportunity. Personalisation and experimentation on apps and websites are critical to reducing churn and driving growth, yet resource constraints and data gaps hinder marketers and product managers. We are committed to helping businesses navigate these challenges with CleverTap\u2019s Product Experiences, which offers effortless ways to personalise and experiment with app and web experiences driving stronger engagement and lasting brand loyalty.\""

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Mac security provider Moonlock, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u2019\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The fate of Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet seems uncertain at this point, with multiple leaks suggesting that a successor was put on ice. It seems, however, that a Pixel Tablet 2 moved into advanced stages of development with some neat upgrades before it was unceremoniously axed.\n\nThe folks over at Android Authority, citing internal documents, report that the second-generation Pixel Tablet would\u2019ve arrived armed with the Tensor G4 silicon, which also powers the Google Pixel 9 series smartphones. Google was also reportedly eyeing a cellular version with a Samsung Exynos 5G modem for the slate.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe biggest upgrade, however, would have been the display. The Pixel Tablet was apparently lined up for a 120Hz refresh rate screen, alongside a slight bump in the peak brightness figures.\n\nThe current-gen Pixel Tablet offers a 60Hz LCD screen, which is arguably subpar for the asking price of $499 at the very minimum. \u201cScrolling through menus, apps, etc., looks slow and choppy on the Pixel Tablet \u2014 as do any system animations,\u201d said the Digital Trends review of the slate.\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help that the software was brimming with bugs, the battery life was underwhelming, and the overall design was far less functionally thoughtful than what one expects from the Pixel team.\n\nGoogle is also said to have earmarked imaging upgrades for the Pixel Tablet 2. The front camera was reportedly upgraded to a 10-megapixel sensor (up from 8-megapixel on the first-gen Pixel Tablet), while the rear camera switched from an 8-megapixel unit to an 11-megapixel snapper.\n\n\u201cThe last upgrade Google was going to bring to the tablet was support for DisplayPort output up to 4K,\u201d adds the report. The company was reportedly planning an updated lineup of accessories for the tablet, including a keyboard case, as well.\n\nThe other noteworthy improvement was a bump in the battery size, going from 6,900mAh to 7,200mAh capacity. That\u2019s not exactly substantial, but for a tablet plagued by battery efficiency woes, any progress would have been welcome.\n\nNotably, the company hasn\u2019t entirely abandoned its tablet ambitions yet. In fact, work on a supposed Pixel Tablet 3 is reportedly underway, and a souped-up version targeting a 2026 launch is also said to be in the pipeline.\n\nWhat\u2019s worrisome is Google\u2019s historically lackadaisical approach to committing to a form factor and making iterative upgrades to it in the long run. The Pixel Tablet falls into one such category, even though Google has moved firmly into an adjacent one with its recent focus on folding phones \u2014 most recently, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nAndroid, despite making significant progress with foldable-first software optimizations, still isn\u2019t quite ready for tablet computing. However, it seems the company\u2019s solution to that laggardness would be rather shocking.\n\nAs per Android Authority, Google is planning to unify Chrome OS into Android in hopes of competing with Apple\u2019s iPad and the iPad platform. Will that be enough to save the Pixel Tablet hopes? Only time will tell.\n\nIn hindsight, Google could snag two trophies in a single attempt by concentrating the efforts on maintaining two ailing platforms and injecting more energy into a unified Android-based architecture for large-screen devices."
