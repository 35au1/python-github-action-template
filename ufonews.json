            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

Their research suggests that the core may have an additional, hidden layer inside it, challenging what scientists have long believed about the planet's structure. This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nChallenging long-standing beliefs\n\nFor decades, Earth has been understood to have four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The inner core, mostly made of iron and nickel, has always been thought to be solid and uniform. However, this new study indicates there could be more to the story.\n\nAlso Read | 230m away from docking- ISRO Spadex satellites are at their closest so far\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSeismic waves reveal new clues\n\nThe team used data from seismic waves\u2014energy waves that travel through the Earth after earthquakes\u2014to study the inner core. They found that these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, suggesting that the inner core might have two layers instead of one.

            "article_content": "San Francisco: Close to two months ago, 26-year-old OpenAI Whistleblower, Suchir Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment under mysterious circumstances; while initially his death was termed as a suicide, his family and some investigative journalists believe it to be a murder. Suchir Balaji's mother, Poornima Rao, in a recent interview, has claimed that her son was not okay with OpenAI becoming \u2018for-profit\u2019. Her interview has been reshared by Elon Musk who has also reacted to it amid his feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n\u2018He Was Not Okay with OpenAI Becoming For-Profit\u2019: Suchir Balaji's Mother\n\nPoornima Rao, Suchir Balaji's mother who has been raising her voice against OpenAI and claiming her son's death to be a murder, has recently made shocking claims in a fresh interview. In a conversation with Mario Nawfal, the OpenAI whistleblower's mother said that her son had joined OpenAI with the belief to help humanity and was not okay with the organisation becoming for-profit.\n\nSuchir Balaji's mother said, \u201cThe reason he joined OpenAI was his belief that AI will help humanity. He was very impressed with OpenAI initially because they were nonprofit. That's when his concern started to arise, and he started questioning himself.\u201d\n\nElon Musk Reshares Interview of Suchir Balaji's Mother, Reacts To Her Shocking Claims\n\nPoornima Rao's interview clip where she is claiming that her son was not happy with OpenAI becoming for-profit, reached Elon Musk as well who shared it on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly known as Twitter). Along with the reshare, he reacted to it with two exclamation marks, \u2018!!\u2019.\n\n\u2018Suchir Balaji Was A Genius\u2019: OpenAI Whistleblower's Mother\n\nIn the same interview, Suchir Balaji's mother talked about how her son was a genius. She said, \u201cWhen he was in high school, for 2 years, every weekend, day and night, he was practicing algorithms. He downloaded data related to machine learning from many different universities. Way before anyone else knew about AI, he was already a champion in machine learning and algorithms. At the age of 11, he started programming. Within 6 months, he used to ask me questions that I could not answer on algorithms.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Acknowledgement from OpenAI of His Contributions\u2019\n\nIn her interview, Suchir Balaji's mother also expressed her sadness because OpenAI never recognised or appreciated her son for his work and contribution to the company, not even after his unfortunate death. She said, \u201cHe did something to fine-tune ChatGPT that made it faster and more efficient. But what bothered him was that there was no recognition for his work until he passed away. Even now, there's no acknowledgement from OpenAI of his contributions. That's very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji's Mother Alleges Murder of Her Son\n\nAmid reports about Suchir Balaji Death Case being a suicide, the 26-year-old boy's mother Poornima Rao has claimed her son's death to be a \u2018cold-blooded murder declared by authorities as suicide\u2019. She further claimed that there was a stark difference between the initial police report and a private autopsy report, that her son's apartment was ransacked and that there were signs of struggle in the bathroom suggesting he was hit and this is not a suicide, but a case of murder.\n\n\u2018This Doesn\u2019t Seems A Suicide': Elon Musk\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has responded to the plea made by the mother of OpenAi Whistleblower Suchir Balaji saying that, \u201cThis doesn't seems a suicide\u201d, in which she called for an FBI investigation following her son's death. Balaji accused the AI gaint of copyright violations, and he was found dead a month after the allegations surfaced.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, his mother, Poornima Ramarao, revealed that they had hired a private investigator and conducted a second autopsy to further investigate the cause of death. According to Ramarao, the private autopsy did not confirm the police's conclusion. In her post, she tagged billionaire Elon Musk and Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom will join the incoming Donald Trump administration and are key ally of president-elect. Mr. Musk, known for his ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, replied to her post, stating, \u201cThis doesn't seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji Case: Controversy Surrounding Indian-American's Death\n\nIndian-American tech researcher Suchir Balaji, 26, who openly criticized the use of copyrighted data in artificial intelligence (AI), was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Balaji, a computer science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, had interned with OpenAI and Scale AI during his college years. He joined OpenAI in 2019 and during his four years at the company, he worked on several projects, including GPT-4 training and improving ChatGPT\u2019s performance. He left OpenAI in August this year, expressing concerns over the potential harm OpenAI could cause. During his tenure, he played a significant role in data collection for OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT. On his personal website, Mr. Balaji elaborated on his concerns, claiming that OpenAI's method of copying data for training its models potentially amounted to copyright infringement.\n\nJust a day before his death, Balaji\u2019s name was mentioned in a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Though details about his involvement remain unclear, his public criticism of the company\u2019s data usage practices likely drew attention to his stance on ethical AI development. Suchir Balaji had accused OpenAI of training its AI models on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorization, a practice he argued was detrimental. \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\" Mr. Balaji said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. The Indian-origin tech professional resigned from OpenAI in October 2023 after nearly four years with the company."

            "article_content": "Late last year, I started writing a column on generative artificial intelligence. I interviewed a few folks and got down a few hundred words before I was overtaken by the events of a hectic election year, during which \"gotta finish that AI column\" was always at the back of my mind, even if I never got around to it.\n\nHere's the punch line: I had been worried about what the future of AI might hold. But while I wasn't paying attention, the future arrived.\n\nAnd AI won.\n\nI suppose I had assumed that most reasonable adults would view AI as skeptically as I did. Its shortcomings are well-documented, and haven't we all seen \"The Terminator\"?\n\nBut when a friend posted to social media asking other professionals how they use AI, the answers were effusive: To organize notes, to generate ideas, to write press releases.\n\nWhen a group of college students visited the Free Press, I was stunned to hear that a particular class is required to use AI \u2013 their prestigious university has its own \"safe\" AI that protects students by not feeding their data into a larger learning model.\n\nA nauseating commercial for a big tech firm's phones shows lonely people chattering away to the company's shiny new AI as though it were a long-lost friend.\n\nWhen an acquaintance reported working alongside students at a coffee shop seemingly pasting material from generative AI directly into assignments, the ensuing online conversation revolved around ethical use of AI \u2012 not how to shut down behavior it seems like most folks would consider inherently dishonest.\n\nThe search bars on Facebook and Instagram have been replaced by AI-assisted search, which confuses the crap out of me. Maybe I'm old, but it all just seems unnecessary.\n\nI may have misjudged my fellow humans. But I'm not wrong about AI. We're jumping feet first into unreliable, unproven tech with devastating environmental costs and a dense thicket of ethical problems. It's a bad idea. And \u2013 because I enjoy shouting into the void \u2013 we really ought to stop.\n\nChatGPT, Gemini are basically text prediction machines\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence research started after World War II as a reaction to the philosophical and psychological school of behaviorism that reduced humans to, well, a set of behaviors, explained Robin Zebrowski, an old college friend, a professor of cognitive science at Beloit College and an internationally recognized expert in the cognition of artificial intelligence, who publishes papers with titles like \"Carving Up Participation: Sense-Making and Sociomorphing for Artificial Minds\" and \"The AI Wars, 1950\u20132000, and Their Consequences.\"\n\nIn the 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" the British mathematician Alan Turing (the man who broke Germany's World War II Enigma code, and was later criminally prosecuted by his own government for being gay) posed a question: Can a machine think in a human enough way to pass as a human?\n\nScientists of that era became fascinated by the why and how of consciousness, and whether it was possible to build a machine that could pass what had become known as the Turing Test.\n\n\"I\u2019m very sympathetic to the mad science of it, but part of it is really like, 'Why can\u2019t we do this? Let\u2019s try it!' which morally is a little dicey,\" Zebrowski said. \"But there was no danger in playing with these systems, because they weren't very good at what they did, and what they did was not what we do.\"\n\n(\"Consciousness is so weird,\" she added. \"We have no idea how it emerges. We're not putting that into a machine anytime soon.\")\n\nAI still doesn't do what we do, but these days, it looks a lot more like it.\n\nOpinion:AI could save your life. But your doctor is likely using it the wrong way.\n\nThe new generative AI models like ChatGPT or Gemini don't exist because of a big leap in technology \u2013 they're essentially text prediction machines, and the neural net technology that powers them has been been around since the 1980s, Zebrowski said. But data \u2013 our data \u2013 has become a commodity.\n\n\"We have the ability to suck up everyone\u2019s data and run it into the grinder,\" Zebrowski said. \"What changed is the availability of data at scale.\"\n\n'AI has no concept of truth'\n\nWith more data, text prediction machines like Gemini or ChatGPT have an infinitely larger set of responses to offer \u2013 even if some of that data is bad. The output of an AI system will always reflect a learning model trained on misinformation or biased information, Zebrowski said, and \"the current AI models were trained on the dregs of the internet.\"\n\nIn 2022, the news outlet CNET quietly started using AI to write some stories. Within months, it had to end the practice, issuing corrections on some of the stories produced by AI.\n\nJust this month, a handful of media outlets issued corrections or retractions after a slew of stories, apparently researched using generative AI, falsely claimed that President George H.W. Bush had pardoned his son Neil.\n\nAnd those are just AI's most high-profile, publicly embarrassing flops. Now imagine that at scale, across all of those meeting notes and panel questions and college assignments.\n\nThese outcomes, Zebrowski said, should surprise no one.\n\n\"That\u2019s the nature of how the system works,\" she said. \"It will always be filled with inaccuracies, because AI has no concept of truth.\"\n\nIs it ever ethical to use AI?\n\nAs far as \"The Terminator\" goes, Zebrowski assured me, that's still pretty unlikely. But that doesn't mean AI, and the way we use it, isn't dangerous.\n\n\"Right now, AI is mostly hype. But it\u2019s doing a lot of damage \u2013 and it's not doing a lot of good yet,\" she said.\n\nBut this is how humans do tech: Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. And that's how we're doing AI \u2013 using it for panel questions and meeting notes and research papers, for medical diagnosis, for homework assignments, to crunch data and replace workers \u2013 absent any reasonable regulatory or universally recognized ethical guidelines.\n\nThe general consensus seems to be that the horse has left the barn, and that any effort to coax it back into its stall is futile. Instead, the argument goes, we've got to learn to ride the horse or we'll get trampled.\n\nThat college professor who visited the Free Press said she's teaching her students ethical use of AI. But that's part of the problem: Can AI be used ethically?\n\nIt's a question the big tech companies might not be interested in answering.\n\nEthicists had rung a lot of alarms about AI \u2013 \"had,\" in some cases, being the operative word.\n\nGoogle forced out its lead AI ethicist in 2020. Microsoft laid off its AI ethics and society team back in 2023. OpenAI's ethics team was disbanded just last year.\n\nThe U.S. government has failed to adopt any meaningful regulation or guidelines for AI development or use, compared witht the European Union, and at least one person (that'd be Elon Musk) who is heavily invested in the proliferation of AI wields outsize influence in the incoming presidential administration.\n\nAI ethicists have laid out very clear guidelines, Zebrowski said, calling for things like government regulation of these systems.\n\n\"But that's unlikely to happen, in part because if you look at who the government is calling in to give them advice about this, it's the CEOs and the people who benefit from AI, so that's going to go poorly,\" she said. \"There's lots of people in particularly marginalized communities who have pointed out specific dangers and specific harms, and they're not getting the audience with the president. So the regulation that we need is very unlikely to show up, at least in the U.S., and that's where most of the companies are headquartered.\n\n\"My guess is, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better, if it gets better.\"\n\nEven OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, is worried\n\nHere's the other thing about AI: It's a product that Big Tech companies have spent big money to develop \u2013 even if it doesn't actually do what they're saying, or at least implying, it does.\n\n\"You hear Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, say openly at a government hearing that he's genuinely worried about what these systems will do, like he didn't release it into the world,\" Zebrowski said. \"It kills me that the public hears this hype that makes it sound like AI is actually going to be super intelligence, and it's going to be smarter and quicker and more powerful than humans, when the companies benefitting from the hype are making the models.\n\n\"There's a reason for the hype, and it\u2019s mostly money. And that means the public doesn't actually know how these systems work, and what we should or should not use them for.\"\n\nHence that helpful commercial depicting AI making thoughtful gift suggestions, or regaling its owner with stories about nature. Tech companies want us to believe that AI \u2013 like smartphones and social media and Bluetooth clothes dryers and refrigerators that tell us when we're out of milk \u2013 is essential to our lives.\n\nAnd tech companies have a great track record at this kind of market bombardment.\n\nThe New York Times Magazine's Willy Staley detailed the tech marketing model in a recent piece about Netflix, explaining how the company charged through years of debt to emerge an essential household service: \"If you applied the logic of the media business to Netflix, it looked uncertain, but Netflix was operating by tech-sector rules \u2013 spending boatloads of cash to acquire customers, changing their habits and overwhelming competitors until, at the other end, an entire industry was transformed.\"\n\nOpinion:Musk is right in visa fight. Trump can secure border \u2013 and support legal immigration.\n\nWhat are the main risks with AI?\n\nBefore Google parted ways with its ethicist, Timnit Gebru, she and other researchers produced a draft paper outlining the chief harms risked by AI. In addition to the inscrutability of AI learning models and the certainty that it will incorporate misinformation, AI systems are trained on data sets generated by people with the most access to technology, creating a dataset biased toward more affluent, tech-friendly people and nations. (Gebru is the researcher who identified problems with the way facial recognition software identifies women and people of color.)\n\nGebru and her team also flagged the environmental consequences of AI \u2013 training a learning model sucks down an enormous amount of energy, resulting in an explosion of emissions \u2013 costs likely to be born by marginalized communities for the benefit of more prosperous organizations or individuals.\n\nA data center just outside Memphis that will provide computing power for Musk's xAI houses 18 or more portable methane gas generations, installed without permits and which residents say emit a constant stream of hazy but visible smoke.\n\nThe historically Black community is no stranger to environmental injustice, but AI presents a new front in this fight: One researcher estimates that a single query to a chatbot uses enough energy to power a lightbulb for 20 minutes.\n\nChatGPT is learning how to be me \u2013 and probably you, too\n\nLast year, I asked ChatGPT to write a column \"in the style of Michigan journalist Nancy Kaffer,\" and it kind of delivered.\n\n\"In the heart of the Great Lakes State, where opportunity should flow freely like our pristine waters, there exists a deep chasm of inequality that threatens the very existence of our society. The battleground for this struggle is none other than our education system \u2013 a system that is supposed to uplift, empower and prepare our future leaders.\"\n\nIt goes on in similar fashion \u2013 \"as we stand at the crossroads of progress, it is imperative that we address this issue head-on\" \u2013 \"together, let us forge a path towards a truly equitable education system.\"\n\nI do write about equity in education. But this is laughably bad: Perky and surface, laden with cliche\u0301s and grand diction, offering little substance and the tone of a well-informed high school sophomore.\n\nWhen I made the same request last month, the result was strikingly different.\n\n\"Michigan's infrastructure is in a quiet crisis,\" ChatGPT wrote. \"It's not a flashy issue that makes the front pages of newspapers or trends on Twitter, but it impacts the daily lives of millions. The cracks in our roads, the flaking paint on bridges, the overworked water systems \u2013 they're all symptoms of a larger more systemic problem that requires urgent attention, not just for the sake of convenience, but for the state's future economic stability. ... There\u2019s a growing call among policymakers to make bold investments in infrastructure, to stop kicking the can down the road. Yet we\u2019re still caught in the tug-of-war between short-term political wins and long-term, necessary spending. Fixing Michigan\u2019s infrastructure is not just a matter of putting a few more dollars into road repair \u2013 it\u2019s about ensuring the state can compete, thrive, and support its citizens well into the future. For those of us living here, the frustration is palpable.\"\n\nI can still tell it's not me. But it's a bundle of phrases I might use and ideas I might endorse, even if it's pasted together without much art or depth.\n\nChatGPT is learning how to be me, and it's getting better at it \u2013 and I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I'm a little worried about what it might deliver a year from now.\n\nWhat is the future of AI and us?\n\nI'm joking about \"The Terminator.\" Mostly.\n\nI love technology: I was an early adopter of the iPhone, and I like to remind my Gen Z son that modern Xboxes and PlayStations exist because in 1987, I used my babysitting money to buy the first Nintendo.\n\nBut when it comes to AI and machine learning, there's also \"The Matrix,\" likewise set in a machine-dominated dystopian future, and \"Bladerunner,\" \"Rossum's Universal Robots\" and \"The Veldt,\" Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. And I can tell you that on the point of this, and it not ending well, the literature is unanimous. It's fiction, sure, but look at the past century: We can only achieve what we can imagine, and science fiction helps us imagine what sort of future is possible.\n\nOr the sort of future we really do not want.\n\nThat thing earlier, about the horse and the barn, is a convincing metaphor. Let's consider a knife, instead. You can spend a lot of effort rendering the knife harmless, wrapping it in tinfoil or duct tape or dulling the blade \u2013 or you could just put it down.\n\nRarely in history have humans voluntarily relinquished technology. One notable exception: the atomic bomb.\n\n\"We did it, we deployed it, most people regretted it, and that spurred decades of us trying to manage and mitigate the fallout from that technology,\" Zebrowski said. \"Everyone was like, 'OK, let's not do this,' but of course, secretly, everyone's still doing it. There's not really a way to tell the whole world we can't pursue this technology. But I really think nuclear technology is the closest analogy I can think of. Because we did all finally agree, or at least mostly, most countries finally agreed, this was not something we should be doing.\"\n\nThere are a lot of ethicists out there who have suggested policy frameworks for the use of AI. For lawmakers who'd like to bring some rationality to this question, such guidelines are easy to find. (If you're a university, you probably have an ethicist or two on staff.)\n\nEven so, when I consider the inherent bias and propensity for error embedded in AI learning sets, the potential for mass shutouts from the workforce and a generation that never got to learn critical thinking skills, because AI did it all for them, I keep coming back to that thing about the knife \u2013 and one thing more: You can't be part of the solution if you're part of the problem.\n\nYou don't have to use AI. And if you do, maybe you should stop.\n\nNancy Kaffer is the editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, where this column originally appeared."

More info\n\nWith staycations steadily becoming a thing of the past, experts pinpointed the cheapest hidden gems across Europe that offer return flights for under \u00a375. Money-saving experts at Savoo delved into the details of upcoming flights and travel trends for 2025 to find the cheapest flights, and the top tips for getting your holiday in under budget.\n\nSpain\n\nDespite holding some of the most popular cities for Brits to vacay in, Spain earned not one but two spots on the list of cheapest return prices. In first place is the seaside Costa del Sol, with return flights going as low as \u00a351.\n\nIt takes roughly the same amount of time to fly to Costa del Sol from London as it does to get you to Manchester via train, only with a hefty price difference as the money-saving experts noted an average one-way train up north costs \u00a354.50. Mallorca also made the list with potential return flights from \u00a362 if you pick your times and dates right.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nOne of the more high profile destinations on the list is the capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague, with return flights starting at \u00a357. Including average hotel prices, cheap and mid-range food to keep you going as well as some beers and coffees over a weekend trip will set you back \u00a3254.27 according to the money experts.\n\nPoland\n\nKrakow comes in third place at \u00a359.50 for return flights and the alternative in Warsaw has a slightly higher premium at \u00a364.30. But both areas also earned a spot on Savoo\u2019s cheapest long weekend getaways in second at \u00a3231.57 and third place with \u00a3242.60 respectively including hotels, food and drinks.\n\nSlovakia\n\nRounding out the top five is Barislava in Slovakia with \u00a363.40 return flights available. The historic city also came in just under Prague for the cheapest weekend getaway, costing roughly \u00a3267.89 for three days and two nights.\n\nFinally, Budapest in Hungary, Vilnius in Lithuania, Riga in Latvia and Lisbon in Portugal rounded out the latter part of the top 10 with return flights ranging between \u00a365 and \u00a371. The experts warned that while hidden gems and lesser-known destinations like Bratislava are likely to have cheaper flights all-year round, there are some ways to bag a bargain on even the most popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe experts shared their top five money-saving tips while booking flights. Starting with the most obvious in avoiding popular dates like Fridays or school holidays when trips are likely to be more expensive due to increased demand.\n\nIf you can be even more flexible with dates, the experts recommended: \u201cLast-minute deals can save you a ton of money. So if you\u2019re brave, try to hold off booking until a couple of weeks before you want to go.\u201d\n\nJust like avoiding popular travel dates, avoiding the popular airports can save some change for your getaway. The experts explained: \u201cConsider an airport close by. For example, if you\u2019re headed to Orlando, you don\u2019t just need to fly into Orlando International Airport. Both Melbourne and Tampa have airports with flights from the UK, which can cost a lot less.\u201d\n\nLayovers generally tend to be cheaper than direct flights, up to 50% in some cases, they claimed, although it is more time-consuming. Using voucher codes, discounts and comparison sites can also earn back some cash for your trip.\n\nOne subtle way to ensure you\u2019re not getting priced out of a getaway is to look for flights using an incognito mode browser tab, the experts recommended. This avoids installing permanent cookies on your browser so you\u2019re less likely to be shown inflated prices sometimes given to people who are consistently browsing some flights."

X (formerly Twitter) has introduced specific labels for parody accounts on its platform.\n\nThe new labeling system will require parody account holders to explicitly identify themselves as such in their account names and bios. To further enhance clarity, X will add a visible label to these accounts, ensuring users can recognise their nature.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rolling out profile labels for parody accounts to clearly distinguish these types of accounts and their content on our platform. We designed these labels to increase transparency and to ensure that users are not deceived into thinking such accounts belong to the entity being parodied,\u201d X\u2019s Safety team said.\n\nCurrently, users can voluntarily add the label to their profiles on X\u2019s settings page. However, the platform intends to make these labels mandatory for parody, commentary, and fan (PCF) accounts in the future.\n\nX also said that users cannot use manufactured identities to engage in disruptive or deceptive behavior. This may include using stock, stolen or AI-generated profile photos, copied or stolen profile bios, and/or misleading profile information for the purpose of deceiving others."

Their research suggests that the core may have an additional, hidden layer inside it, challenging what scientists have long believed about the planet's structure. This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nChallenging long-standing beliefs\n\nFor decades, Earth has been understood to have four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The inner core, mostly made of iron and nickel, has always been thought to be solid and uniform. However, this new study indicates there could be more to the story.\n\nAlso Read | 230m away from docking- ISRO Spadex satellites are at their closest so far\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSeismic waves reveal new clues\n\nThe team used data from seismic waves\u2014energy waves that travel through the Earth after earthquakes\u2014to study the inner core. They found that these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, suggesting that the inner core might have two layers instead of one. This discovery could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history.\n\nAlso Read | Zuckerberg claims Biden officials would 'scream' to enforce Covid 'censorship' on Facebook\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHints of two cooling events\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings is that the structure of iron inside the inner core might have changed over time. Scientists believe that this could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history. This discovery could explain some inconsistencies seen in earlier models of Earth\u2019s core.\n\nAlso Read | China mulling re-creating \u2018Three Gorges Dam project\u2019 in space. Here is how\n\nData gaps and future research\n\nWhile the results are exciting, the researchers caution that there are still gaps in the data, particularly from polar regions, which could affect the conclusions. Despite this, the study is a major step forward in understanding the mysteries of Earth\u2019s interior."

Los Angeles won six away games this season, a fact that appears to be baked into the spread.\n\nThe Chargers, who rebounded from last season\u2019s last-place finish in the AFC West, led the NFL in scoring defense during the regular season, at 17.7 points per game. Justin Herbert has passed for 10 TDs and no interceptions in his past eight road starts. He finished the regular season strong, passing for two-plus TDs in four consecutive games.\n\nThe Texans dropped two consecutive games, to the Ravens and Chiefs, before closing the regular season with a meaningless win over Tennessee. Baltimore held Houston to two points in the Week 17 loss. In his past five games, C.J. Stroud has not passed for 250 yards, while totaling six TD passes during that span. In three of his past four games, Joe Mixon failed to rush for 30 yards.\n\nIf I were signing up for this FanDuel new user promo I\u2019d make my first bet on the Chargers to cover. Herbert is rolling into the postseason and the Los Angeles defense will certainly hold Stroud down."

            "article_content": "Though it sometimes feels like everyone's following the same trend (AI), the technology we saw at CES 2025 was remarkably diverse, from practical devices for your home to mind-bogglingly powerful laptops to the next revolutions in health tech.\n\nSome of the concepts at CES might come years in the future (or never), while many other products are available for sale right now. Here are the six biggest trends from CES that we think will make the largest impact in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for the very top products from the trade show, be sure to check out the official 2025 Best of CES Awards, selected by the CNET Group.\n\nRobots keep getting better, smarter, cuter, smaller and creepier\n\nMost of the non-novelty robots shown at CES bear a functional resemblance to the robots used commercially -- by that I mean you can tell they're the product of the same research in movement and AI as they pick things up, fold, clean and so on. Expensive models like Mi-Mo, Beatbot, R2D3 and more.\n\nSamsung's yellow Ballie home robot is going to ship this year. James Martin/CNET\n\nMore consumer-friendly models were less functional, like the tiny, fuzzy bots that you hang on your handbag as a fashion statement or the adorable model with huge anime eyes that follows you around on wheels but seems like a surveillance nightmare (the TCL AI Me). There were also the concepts of yesteryear that finally edged toward saleability, such as Samsung's Ballie -- a spherical bot with a projector in its belly, like a baby Teletubbie.\n\nWatch this: Sorry, There Are No 'Best Robots' at CES This Year 03:22\n\nOn the \"whut?\" front perches a tiny robot whose function is simply to blow on hot beverages.\n\nBut the models that resonated the most with us were home helpers that don't cost tens of thousands of dollars, like Roborock's Saros Z70 robot vacuum cleaner -- it sports an arm that can pick up your socks -- or Eureka's J15 Max Ultra, which detects spills and untangles its own brushes. And one of the most innovative was the Lymow One, a robot mower that cuts the grass and feeds mulched matter back to your lawn. There's always a ton of laundry robots -- unsurprising given how much everyone hates laundry -- like Tenet's AI Laundry Robot, which washes and folds.\n\nAnd we can't forget the token \"most human-looking\" robot, Realbotix's $175K Aria robot, which is designed for \"companionship and intimacy\" -- and looks it, given she's built along the lines of an old-school Barbie.\n\nUltimately, we chose not to pick a best robot because of how removed they were from interaction. In fact, many of the expensive models were in more of a zoo environment: Look at the magical creature in its habitat, repeatedly picking things up and moving them elsewhere. That's the kind of thing we've been seeing for years.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nNvidia doesn't make robots, but it's been working on its robot LLMs and operating systems for years. And every time Nvidia trots out this visual at its events, I can't help but think that Nvidia is building a robot army. Well, that and Metropolis.\n\nAI inside, again, but more powerful\n\nThere seemed to be less hype about AI in devices (though it's possible I have successfully learned to tune it out), but about the same in mobile apps like Delta's AI concierge. However, it was everywhere in laptops thanks to the annual chip updates from Intel and AMD -- which of course brought the usual faster, better and improved battery life -- plus bundles of \"try it!\" software for your out-of-the-box AI experience.\n\nWatch this: Everything Announced at Nvidia's CES Event in 12 Minutes 11:47\n\nBut in this respect, Nvidia stole the show for its Cosmos AI model (Nvidia has been working on and licensing its various models for autonomous cars, robots and more for years, but this seemed to be its biggest \"moment\"), as well as its unveiling of the newest generation of consumer graphics.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Hands-Down Won AI at CES 2025, and Also the Show Itself. Here's Why That Matters\n\nThe GeForce RTX 50 series not only promises the typical performance bump PC gamers expect, but thanks to the new Blackwell generation of GPUs, it brings more powerful and better generative AI capabilities down to your local system. That means cheaper entry for developers, the ability for end users to run bigger models, as well speed improvements (via Nvidia's DLSS 4) and more sophisticated capabilities for games.\n\nWatch this: These New Smart Glasses Want to Be Your Next AI Companion 02:31\n\nThere weren't a lot of new smart glasses, but Halliday's stood out for the way they present information: Rather than on the screen, they have a tiny monochrome display that shows text.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Smart Glasses Moment Is Here. But They're Still Missing Something Big\n\nThe big AI news for cars at CES wasn't, for once, autonomininity: It was Volkswagen bringing ChatGPT to its voice assistant for more complex, natural-language help.\n\nRead more: Nvidia's CEO Explains How Its New AI Models Could Work on Future Smart Glasses\n\nCouch potato 'tainment\n\nOne of CES' core pillars is entertainment (it used to be baked right into the name), which generally means TVs and audio. There weren't any new screen technologies, but there were improvements and innovations with existing ones.\n\nThe suction cups on the back of the Displace TV James Martin/CNET\n\nTweaks to OLED came to TVs, with LG's G5 OLED's quality bump impressing us the most for its better brightness and contrast, along with HiSense's 116-inch MicroLED model. But the TV that seemed to make the biggest impact on us were Displace's hang-anywhere-thanks-to-huge-suction-cups TVs, shipping versions of prototypes we've seen in past years.\n\nWatch this: Displace TV's 55-Inch Television Hangs From a Wall Using Suction Cups 03:15\n\nI think its impact was partly due to the enormous opportunity for \"suck\" puns.\n\nThere was the usual complement of gaming desktops, laptops and monitors, the latter offering the typical year upgrade to higher refresh rates (500Hz and 600Hz).\n\nWatch this: Lenovo's New Legion Go S Gaming Handheld Is Lighter and Smaller but Packs a Big Surprise 03:30\n\nBut the biggest hit was Lenovo's new handheld console. The company is the first to offer (or at least announce) a SteamOS-based model, one of the new Legion G S models. Acer's Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld, however, earned some mockery, because you can't really respect a \"handheld\" if it's bigger than your head.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Time for an Xbox Handheld Is Now\n\nBut it was also kind of hard to sustain excitement about gaming hardware at CES this year, because of a shiny new thing possibly on the horizon. Rumors say the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming soon.\n\nHealth and beauty, the staples of CES\n\nSometimes I think CES specializes in sleep, skin and smart rings, plus technology designed to make you feel like a loser -- so many smart mirrors, though none yet use generative AI to simulate your mother's critical voice or to show you what you could look like if you just tried harder. But maybe that's just me.\n\nThere may not have been as many this year, but there were some standouts. Withing's Omnia smart mirror combines a scale and a mirror to not only tell you if you're overweight and in bad health, but to show you as well. There's always a device for analyzing your skin to tell you what to buy to fix it, such as L'Oreal's BioPrint. (To be fair, I don't know what it's suggestions are.)\n\nWatch this: I Said Yes to Trying a Smart Ring You Can Propose With 01:45\n\nAnd, oh, the rings. One way to attract attention among the plethora of rings designed to monitor your health is to make it gold and platinum, like the UltraHuman Rare ring: Nothing's more romantic than a ring that says, \"Marry me\" and \"Please don't die,\" simultaneously. Or alternatively, \"Show me off on Instagram.\"\n\nDon't forget the annual dose of flatware that makes you healthier. This year's entrant is Kirin Electric Salt Spoon, intended to give you that salty taste without any of the nasty sodium -- by zapping your tongue with a bit of electricity. On the other hand, if they could do that for chocolate, I'd be first in line.\n\nLisa Eadicicco/CNET\n\nAnd while the Nike x Hyperice's \"boatlike booties are basically recovery high-tops festooned with buttons and designed to help your weary tootsies recover from soreness and strain,\" they sound pretty awesome.\n\nBut there were some truly practical and innovative new products, like the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which stay in, are flush with your ears for side sleepers and have sensors and other tech to help improve the quality of your sleep. Our team also called out the YoctoMat, a smart yoga mat that provides feedback on your poses. And while I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as health or beauty, in the interest of hydration, the Roam SodaTop is a bottle cap with a CO2 cartridge so you can carbonate your water on the go.\n\nHome is where the heat is\n\nHome tech tends to cover a lot of bases, many of them robotic. No one really likes to vacuum, do laundry or mow the lawn like the AI-driven robot vacuums and lawnmower I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Commentary I Really Don't Want an AI Pot to Turn My Plant Into a Tamagotchi From Hell\n\nVideo smart locks seemed to be the focus of home security upgrades this year -- we call out Lockly's Vision Prestige and TCLs Smart Lock D1 Ultra -- providing more information than existing models. Notable, also, because someone breaking in doesn't use the video doorbell.\n\n23 Fascinating Home Tech Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025, the Biggest Tech Show on Earth +21 More See all photos\n\nCooling and heating were hot as well, especially Samsung's DHS Mono R32 HT heat pump, which heats outside air, condenses it to water and feeds it to your water tank. As an apartment dweller, I'm partial to the Gradient All-Weather 120V Window Heat Pump, which supplies heat when the weather gets frosty. Cooling and heating go hand-in-hand with utility bills and power backup -- I was really intrigued by the BioLite, which provides battery backup for a couple of key appliances, like the refrigerator.\n\nAnd Savant's Smart Budget is designed to save you money by routing power automatically (and manually) to balance output, thereby potentially saving you the expense of rewiring your home to support new, power-sucking devices. Plus, Aqara introduced the Touchscreen Dial V1, a clever and useful dial that can control all your smart devices\n\nAnd lest we forget the bread-and-butter of small appliances. There are always plenty, though really it's the oddballs and gimmicks that catch more attention than the mundane. This year, we saw the phone-controlled Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 Multi-Oven, the Apecoo tortilla and roti maker (food samples really seemed to attract us), LG's \"Perfect Fancy Microwave for Social Media\" with a 27-inch display and much, much more.\n\nThe future and the future's future\n\nThe big deals for cars (and other things that tote people) tend to be new technologies and other future-flung concepts. BMW gave us panoramic IDrive with operating system X, a three-tier, ultra wide holographic 3D windshield display that's actually not too far out from your next BMW, and Hyundai Mobis holographic windshield display one-ups it by constraining the angle of view to the driver.\n\nWatch this: Aptera Solar EV Gets All the Energy It Needs From the Sun 04:45\n\nWe see flying cars at the show every year, but sadly we're no closer to me getting one. This year's concept-du-jour was the Xpeng AeroHT, a massive six-wheeler with an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in its trunk. Aptera's solar EV isn't a flying car, but it really looks like it should have wings.\n\nThe Pebble Flow Electric RV concept -- solar chargeable -- came back for a visit, as did Sony's Afeela, and the latter is ready for your money, if not delivery. Honda trotted out prototypes of its 0 series EVs (one step closer to reality than the concept we saw last year), a sports sedan and a van. See the new photos.\n\nBut a new motor concept claims to vastly increase the range of EVs -- arguably more important than all the shiny paint and glowy dashboards.\n\nGeoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nAnother concept that appealed to me personally was Nanosys' next-gen MicroLED, dubbed UV LED, which uses ultraviolet light to energize RGB quantum dots to precise frequencies: Different lIght frequencies are how we perceive color. MicroLED may potentially supplant OLED in big screens and small. It somewhat upstaged Samsung's MicroLED watch concept with an uber-bright screen. Samsung also brought us a somewhat disturbing-looking stretchable screen for a 3D-ish view and a transparent MicroLED screen. Lenovo's concept ThinkBook with a rollable screen looks and gesture controls appear sleek.\n\nIn a class by itself, the Flint Paper Battery claims to be a new, sustainable power source that may eventually replace lithium ion with cellulose.\n\nWatch this: I Made Things Weird Trying TSA's New Shoe Scanner Machine 03:53\n\nFinally, I will never forget Bridget Carey smuggling Gummy Worms in her shoe to test TSA's new scanner -- after complaining about the ick factor of shuffling our socks or bare soles across a floor that's had thousands of other shoes scrape across it. Gummy Worms in your shoe has a pretty high ick factor, too."

            "article_content": "Tomorrow\u2019s workplace will see the proliferation of automation, robots, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Data will go from big to colossal, and video-enabled collaboration will push teams further, faster. Exponential technological growth is changing work as we know it forever; yet key values endure.\n\nAI\u2019s transformative technology will solve complex problems and enhance human capabilities across industries, yet it must be responsibly developed. AI is not only a technology challenge, it\u2019s a leadership opportunity. This is what business schools must focus on every day: How can we best prepare students for responsible leadership? How can we prepare them to lead others into the unknown and to create value and positive change in a world of new driving forces, including AI?\n\nActive learning\n\nThe best preparation for future action is active learning. The Socratic method, complemented by the case study method, builds leadership capacity at a higher and faster rate than other methods of learning. In 2000 BCE, Socrates strolled through Athens\u2019 agora (marketplace) and shared his belief that true wisdom comes not from having all of the answers but in knowing how to ask the right questions. Questions peel away layers of assumption, encourage dialogue, make room for curiosity and innovation and require a strong dose of humility. This timeless posture of learning through questions \u2014 the Socratic Method \u2014 strengthens the muscle of critical thinking and develops the skills of collaboration and communication.\n\nThere are few business schools in the world that use the Socratic method and even fewer that underpin it with the case study method. Here\u2019s how it works: Faculty do not deliver lectures while students take notes. Instead, learners engage in active and experiential learning.\n\nIn the case study method, MBA students examine hundreds of real-life business case studies, replete with challenges and twists. They review these cases with their teams and come to class prepared to express their own formulated ideas and arguments and to apply their knowledge. Ethics, innovation and sustainability are themes woven across the curriculum. Up to 50% of a student\u2019s grade comes from participating in classroom conversation. The faculty orchestrate this symphony of ideas, opinion, debate and feedback, ensuring that the students learn not just from the professor but from each other.\n\nBuild leadership\n\nStudents also evaluate their purpose and articulate their values. They join learning teams and take on leadership positions in student organisations. Student self-governance means that students aren\u2019t just passengers; they are co-pilots. This interactive learning model teaches learners to solve problems with imperfect information, and to speak persuasively and confidently. Putting the learner in the role of the general manager builds leadership capacity and prepares them for the work they will be hired to do: to make recommendations for action.\n\nThe writer is Dean of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business."

            "article_content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) in November 2024. So, technically, it was only in the index for a small portion of the year. But it was still, by far, the best-performing Dow stock in 2024 with a 171.2% return, walloping second-place Walmart's 71.9% gain and third-place American Express' 58.4%.\n\nNvidia stock went up a mind-numbing 818.9% between 2023 and 2024, which may lead some investors to question how much further it can run before its valuation gets stretched too thin.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's why the rally in Nvidia stock is somewhat justified, why Nvidia could continue outperforming the market and is worth buying, and some reasons to keep Nvidia on a watchlist for now.\n\nNvidia's momentum knows no bounds\n\nNvidia followed up a rip-roaring 2023 with another incredible year in 2024 -- briefly becoming the most valuable company in the world before Apple reclaimed the title.\n\nNvidia has defended its commanding lead in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market despite a slew of competition. In December, Nvidia announced that its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence (AI) was coming to Amazon Web Services. On Jan. 3, Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion in its current fiscal year to \"build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\" On Jan. 7, Amazon said it plans to spend $11 billion in the U.S. state of Georgia alone on AI infrastructure and cloud technologies.\n\nNvidia could easily beat the market again in 2025 because it continues to innovate, and AI spending is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nNvidia rallied to an all-time high on Monday in response to news that Nvidia customer Hon Hai Precision Industry (also known as Foxconn) is seeing massive growth for AI in cloud and networking. The rally could have also been driven by anticipation of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang giving the keynote address at CES, a major technology conference in Las Vegas. However, Nvidia pulled back 6.2% on Tuesday after Huang's keynote.\n\nNvidia will report its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 26. Analyst consensus estimates call for $2.95 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share and $4.43 in fiscal 2026 earnings per share -- implying year-over-year growth of 50%. So it's worth understanding that there are lofty expectations already baked into Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.6.\n\nThe power of earnings growth\n\nNvidia is by no means a cheap stock based on near-term expectations. But it could grow into its valuation over time if it continues innovating and sees sustained product demand.\n\nNo force is more powerful in the stock market than earnings growth. Earnings growth can justify a premium valuation and make a stock quickly look cheap.\n\nFor example, if Nvidia stock returns 20% per year over the next five years but averages 30% earnings growth in that period, its forward P/E will decline from its current level of around 51 to under 30.\n\nThis lesson demonstrates why excellent earnings growth can make expensive stocks look like a good value for long-term investors. As long as Nvidia continues on its path, it should have no problem outperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). However, if there's a major industrywide slowdown or competition heats up, it wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia sell off.\n\nA person sitting at a table, looking calmly at a laptop computer.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRapidly growing earnings sets Nvidia apart\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry. Earnings are soaring, and so is the stock price. But for earnings to keep going up, Nvidia has to lap its difficult comps. That could become challenging if the investment cycle enters a slowdown or less expensive alternatives, like chips made by Advanced Micro Devices, eat away at some of Nvidia's market share.\n\nThe buy case for Nvidia is quite simple. If you believe the company will remain a long-term winner in AI, the stock is worth buying and holding. But it's worth understanding that Nvidia's sky-high operating margins, market share, and growth rate may not be sustainable over the long term.\n\nEven if revenue growth remains strong, Nvidia's earnings growth could fall if its margins come down. Nvidia's trailing 12-month gross margin is 75.9%, and its operating margin is 62.7% -- meaning it's converting the majority of sales into operating income, a truly unbelievable feat.\n\nBut earnings growth can slow down\n\nNvidia's high profitability comes from the ability to set premium prices for its products, which deep-pocketed customers willingly pay to further their AI ambitions. If those customers aren't able to monetize AI as well as they hoped, they could slow their pace of AI spending, which would affect Nvidia even if it continues cranking out great products. Put another way, Nvidia needs to continue making great products, and its customers must be able to afford those products. For example, companies can spend money on Nvidia computing hardware for self-driving vehicles, but those vehicles must sell to justify future order volumes.\n\nJust as the buy case for Nvidia is fairly straightforward, I think the reasons to keep it on a watchlist are also simple. Some investors may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to how Nvidia handles mounting competition, how it performs in an industry slowdown, and if it can continue to be the undisputed industry leader.\n\nNvidia has been at the top of its game, uninterrupted, for a couple of years now. If it keeps it up, it's easy to see how Nvidia could become the most valuable company in the world and maintain position. But it's also possible that spending on AI could flatline for a few years, or that some unforeseen challenges will appear that hinder Nvidia's ability to grow.\n\nApproaching an investment in Nvidia\n\nNvidia is priced for strong and sustained growth, but not for perfection. Despite the run-up, it doesn't have a nose-bleed valuation. Instead of trying to time the market, it's better to do some research and decide where you stand on Nvidia.\n\nIf you decide not to buy the stock now and keep it on a watchlist, it's important to have clearly defined reasons for what needs to change to consider buying the stock. That way, you can ensure you are using business performance as a measuring stick, and not the stock price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

It is the process by which one of the most important cells that causes inflammatory bowel disease goes wrong.\"\n\nDubbing it a 'holy grail' discovery, he explained that drugs which are already approved for other illnesses such as cancer were able to calm this excessive inflammation - but they need to be tweaked to perfection to target the macrophages.\n\nDr Lee said he hopes that clinical trials will be underway within five years.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey are now keen to set up human trials after realising drugs which already exist seem to reverse the disease in laboratory experiments - so it's looking up for those with IBD.\n\nIf you didn't know, around half a million people in the UK are suffering from some form of inflammatory bowel disease, but Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both the most common.\n\nSufferers typically experience symptoms such as diarrhoea, stomach pain or cramps, blood in their poo, bleeding from their bottom, fatigue and excessive weight loss without trying.\n\nThere's obviously a big overlap between the signs of IBD and other similar conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but you can differentiate between the two as IBD causes inflammation in the bowels.\n\nAccording to the NHS website at the time of writing, it is 'not clear' what causes the disease, but it 'happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed'.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to update the website as now it\u2019s very much clear."

According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

You just take it, and if it works, it works; if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. But what actually happens is that you have to start on this teensy-eensy dose and then, a week later, increase to the next dose and the next one. And then you start to get the side effects. When it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 which is most of the time, either because the drug doesn\u2019t help or the side effects are too bad \u2014 you have to do the whole thing in reverse. So it takes forever, and in the meantime you\u2019re in pain, and trying to take care of your children, and do your job, and all the rest.\u201d\n\nOne day last fall, I met Gereau at his lab in the anesthesiology department on the Washington University campus, in St. Louis, where he directs one of four centers devoted to recovering and studying tissue samples taken from patients with chronic pain. Gereau is cheerful and funny, with a gray-blond beard and the slightly distracted air of someone who would rather be getting back to work. (Once, on a video call, he mentioned a colleague\u2019s research study, then stared silently into space. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, abashed. \u201cI was thinking about the study.\u201d)\n\nThe lab that day was packed with graduate students and postdocs working at different stations. Gereau led me to a back table where Bryan Copits, a scientist who oversees tissue procurement, retrieved a small Ziploc bag from a tray of ice pellets. Inside was a tiny beige triangle \u2014 roughly like what you\u2019d get if you sliced off the very tip of your pinkie. Copits explained that it was a dorsal root ganglion: a cluster of cells that acts as a kind of switchboard, routing signals from the periphery to the central nervous system. (This one had been recovered from a thoracic vertebra and is one of several responsible for managing nerve signals in the body\u2019s trunk.) After gently returning it to the bag, he opened a different one and brought out a piece of \u201cfresh frozen\u201d spinal cord: a red-and-white-streaked nugget that looked disconcertingly like a piece of artificial crab.\n\nThe ability to examine tissue recovered from patients with chronic pain is a major step forward. Until recently, researchers and pharmaceutical companies studying pain primarily used mice or other animals as human proxies and would then invest years \u2014 often more than a decade \u2014 trying to develop a drug based on those findings. \u201cWhat we learned, unfortunately, is that some of the receptors we identified in mice weren\u2019t expressed at the same level, or in the same place, in people,\u201d Gereau said. \u201cWhen you go from animal to human, and a drug fails, that\u2019s 20 years of work gone.\u201d That high failure rate is why many pharmaceutical companies stopped trying to develop new pain medications more than a decade ago. \u201cSo now the idea is to go the other way: to use these new technologies to identify drug targets based on changes in human tissue,\u201d Gereau said.\n\nAs a first step in that process, Juliet Mwirigi, a postdoc in Gereau\u2019s lab, spent two months training an algorithm to identify different types of neurons and other cells in the ganglion. \u201cThey bring fragments of live tissue here, to the tissue-culture room, so we can see how cells change their behavior in response to pain,\u201d Mwirigi told me."

            "article_content": "The elixir of life: When AI meets genomics\n\nDr. Khaled Walid Mahmoud\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) and genetic engineering represents an unprecedented turning point in human history. By merging digital capabilities with biology, these fields are unlocking the secrets of life and reshaping it in profound ways. Among the leaders in this transformative era is the biotech company Shift Bioscience, which recently secured $16 million in seed funding to support its groundbreaking research on reversing aging. Utilizing generative AI, the company simulates human cells to identify genes capable of rejuvenation, paving the way for treatments aimed at slowing or even reversing the effects of aging.\n\nHowever, this scientific leap forward is intertwined with deeper complexities concerning humanity\u2019s understanding of existence and the boundaries of scientific intervention. Genomics, one of the most intricate sciences, deciphers the DNA code that holds information about our biological history, present, and future. Dubbed the \u201celixir of life,\u201d genomics enables humans to correct genetic mutations that impact health. Yet, it also raises thorny ethical questions about the limits of genetic modification and its implications for human nature itself.\n\nAI excels in tackling the challenges inherent in this complexity. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, precise genetic modifications can now correct hereditary errors responsible for various diseases. Advanced technologies such as DeepCRISPR and CRISPR-Net enhance the accuracy of these modifications and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. AI not only identifies target genes but also designs guide RNA sequences to ensure precise execution of genetic edits. These extraordinary capabilities are redefining our relationship with our bodies, making it possible to predict future diseases, prevent them, and even improve genetic traits before future generations are born.\n\nDespite these advancements, the scientific revolution is not without its challenges and risks. While scientists pursue the dream of biological immortality, privacy concerns emerge as one of the most significant threats. Genetic data analysis, also known as genetic fingerprinting, reveals the biological secrets of individuals, which could potentially be exploited to develop biological weapons or invade personal privacy. Without robust legal and ethical frameworks, these technologies become a double-edged sword\u2014either enhancing human well-being or exposing humanity to exploitation.\n\nBeyond ethical risks, humanity faces new challenges related to increasing reliance on technology. A notable example is the impact of modern devices like GPS systems on the human brain. Studies show that drivers who rely on these systems experience shrinkage in brain regions responsible for navigation, while those who rely on natural skills maintain the health of these areas. This \u201ctechnological colonization,\u201d which threatens to undermine human capabilities, raises questions about the price we pay for technological progress.\n\nThe ongoing scientific revolution is not merely about technical achievements; it is a test of our ethical and human values. Genetic modification and anti-aging technologies may bring biological immortality closer to reality, but the larger question remains: How do we balance scientific ambition with the preservation of human essence? While AI delves into the \u201cbiological library\u201d within our bodies, humanity bears the responsibility of ensuring these innovations serve, rather than dominate, us.\n\nThis complex question gains urgency as scientific progress accelerates, tempting some to prioritize profit or power over ethics. It is crucial to establish regulatory frameworks to govern the use of genetic data and protect it from misuse. Yet, regulations alone are insufficient; societies need a collective awareness of the importance of balancing technological progress with respect for human values.\n\nAs AI and genetic engineering open unprecedented doors to enhancing and prolonging life, the greatest challenge remains ensuring that these innovations reflect our shared aspiration for a more humane and secure future. Technology, with all its potential, is merely a tool; its true value lies in how it is used to serve humanity.\n\nGenomics stands as humanity\u2019s most ambitious and transformative scientific pursuit\u2014a profound journey to decipher the very code of life and reshape its narrative. In unraveling the mysteries of DNA, we are not merely advancing the boundaries of biology; we are fundamentally redefining what it means to be human. This monumental endeavor holds the promise of becoming the ultimate \u201celixir of life,\u201d capable of curing diseases, extending longevity, and enhancing our existence. Yet, it also carries the weight of profound ethical and societal challenges. The true legacy of genomics will be determined by our capacity to wield its power with wisdom, foresight, and responsibility.\n\nThe writer is a researcher specializing in cyber politics, holding a PhD on the topic of \u201cCyberspace and Power Shifts in International Relations.\u201d"
