Lee said Andrews half expected her Majesty to get out of the car, only to find out it was actually her chief scientific advisor.\n\nRetired CID officer John Hanson, who is a UFO researcher and author said there was \u2018undoubtedly\u2019 a link between crop circles and UFOs.\n\nHe said: \u201cParticularly the early crop circles were just circular, burnt formations in the grass or in the fields. I think they described them as UFO nests back in the olden days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to witnesses who have more or less seen these things appear and then gone over and then ended up with some quite terrifying experiences.\u201d\n\nThe doc also claims that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were hugely interested in the Rendlesham UFO case from 1980 - which has been dubbed the British Roswell.\n\nThe case allegedly saw a UFO land in the forest at Rendlesham over Christmas weekend in 1980. Numerous airforce personnel, from nearby RAF Bentwaters, which was a US NATO base at the time, went to investigate and saw strange orbs and beams of light shining through the forest.\n\nThe film also investigates wild claims that, the then, Prince Charles piloted an experimental UFO type craft in 1975, and explores what he can do now as King to aid UFO disclosure.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhat I wanted to show in this film is how passionate and serious the senior royals were on the subject of UFOs. They had to keep this mostly a secret because of possible ridicule but if such high standing, balanced people, took them seriously why can\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cThere is something that pilots and police officers are seeing in the skies that can\u2019t be explained so why can\u2019t the British government take them seriously?\u201d\n\nJoin the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

He added: \u201cHere is somebody who could pick up the phone and say look here what\u2019s going on in the United States. He could ask for a full classified briefing.\u201d\n\nThe film includes footage from John Hanson, taken in 2000, of the alleged UFO sighting Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.\n\nThe \u2018sighting\u2019 became known as the British Roswell - in reference to the 1947 crash of a United States Army Air Forces balloon near Roswell, New Mexico which birthed a conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nLee claims Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, was the first member of the Royal Family to have a UFO experience in around 1875. Lee said: \u201cHe wrote an entry in his journal saying he saw strange, dazzling lights in the sky, like orbs flying past and he couldn\u2019t describe them. It was powerful enough for him to make an entry in his diary and the basis of modern, royal UFOlogy.\u201d\n\nLee said Lord Mountbatten, Prince Phillip\u2019s uncle had a passion for UFO\u2019s. Nick Pope, a retired member of the Ministry of Defence, also claims the Royals have been interested in UFO\u2019s for decades.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut this was always a matter of extreme sensitivity because in some ways it was counter to the government\u2019s public position on this. Or if not directly counter to it, certainly difficult to gel with it.\n\n\u201cPrince Phillip was very much at the forefront of Royal interest in this, though arguably he was introduced to that subject by Lord Mountbatten.\u201d\n\nThe film also looks at the story that the the Prince Charles flew a prototype UFO in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1975. Lee said: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t extra terrestrial, it was a saucer shaped craft. But the funny thing is it has some strange magnetic propulsion system which was unknown.\u201d\n\nThe craft was said to have emitted a blue ionic flame and was controlled magnetically by a larger craft behind it.\n\nBut the film does acknowledge Prince William is not known to have had any UFO experiences.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhoever is King is going to have an important role to play on the world stage with disclosure being imminent that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

        "article_content": "When a rancher in New Mexico came across scattered pieces of an alleged UFO in 1947, the US Air Force gathered the debris for further examination. The entire controversy that followed is covered in detail in the episode titled \u2018The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 of Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries,\u2019 which also features interviews with various UFO enthusiasts. One of the prominent Ufologists in the UFO community, Kevin Randle, also talks about his views on the 1947 Roswell incident.\n\nKevin Randle is a Retired Lieutenant Colonel With Decades of Experience in the Army\n\nKevin Douglas Randle was born on June 4, 1949, into a loving household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. From his early days, he was ambitious and wanted to achieve great things in life. While he was in high school, his interest in UFOs and aliens rose so much that he began studying the subject in his free time. After graduating from high school, he went to the University of Iowa, where he studied journalism. Finding interest in psychology, Kevin then got his master\u2019s degree in the same and a Ph. D. from California Coast University. Expanding his knowledge in different subjects, he also got into the American Military University and earned a second master\u2019s degree in military studies.\n\nFulfilling his dream of serving his nation, Kevin became an integral part of the US Army in the Vietnam War as a helicopter pilot and in the Iraq War as a Battalion Intelligence Officer. He was also in the US Air Force, serving as a general\u2019s aide, a public affairs officer, as well as an intelligence officer. After completing his Air Force Reserve duty, he filled the position of an intelligence officer at the Iowa National Guard. For the courage he displayed on the battlefield while deployed in Iraq several times, he was given a Combat Action Badge. After serving his nation for numerous decades, Kevin retired from the Iowa National Guard as a Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nThe Successful Author Also Runs a UFO-Based Podcast Show\n\nIn order to feed his curiosity and passion for UFOs, Kevin also started writing for UFO magazines at a fairly young age. Having more than three decades of experience under his belt as a professional writer, he has written and published all kinds of write-ups, from science fiction and techno-thrillers to action-adventure and non-fiction. However, out of more than 80 books that he has written, Kevin is widely recognized for his books about the 1947 Roswell story and UFOs. Some of his popular books include \u2018The Roswell Encyclopedia,\u2019 \u2018A History of UFO Crashes,\u2019 \u2018Conspiracy of Silence,\u2019 and \u2018Project Moondust.\u2019\n\nBesides that, he has also co-authored books such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 and \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell.\u2019 Given his knowledge of the Roswell story and everything related to UFO, Dr. Kevin Douglas Randle is considered one of the leading researchers and experts on those subjects within the community of UFO enthusiasts. For nearly eight years, he has also been hosting a podcast series titled \u2018A Different Perspective with Kevin Randle,\u2019 where he interviews alleged UFO witnesses and gets them to talk about their purported encounters and experiences with the unknown.

That\u2019s because it delves into how this incident was initially teletyped as a UFO crash, only to suddenly be changed to an Army balloon crashing owing to the bad weather. However, as per reports, some, like Major Jesse Marcel, couldn\u2019t help but continue talking about the alleged UFO with his family before ultimately going public with the information he had in the 1970s.\n\nJesse and Denice Marcel Grew Up With Tales of Aliens\n\nAccording to records, Major Jesse Marcel of the Army\u2019s 509th Bomb Group in New Mexico was the only atomic bomb unit in the entire world at the time; he was the one called Ypom to investigate the crash. Upon reaching the spit, he realized the debris was of strange material \u2013 hard yet flexible with violet writing written in it in symbol \u2013 before deciding he wouldn\u2019t stick around. That\u2019s because even he wanted to turn over a new leaf for his family, and he was well on his way before the rich vampire came into the picture again.\n\nMajor Jesse\u2019s only child with his loving wife Viaud Aleen Abrams was merely 11 at the time, yet he remembered how his rule-following father broke protocol that same night and brought some debris home to show it to him. Therefore, when he eventually had kids, Jesse III, Denice, and John, he told them the same things, with their grandfather telling them some information too. However, it was only well after the decorated officer retired in the 1970s and was growing older that he decided even the world needed to hear his truth, which he did so by feature=ing in the show. His son then backed him, and his grandchildren continued backing him.\n\nJesse and Denice Continue to Support Their Grandfather\u2019s Accounts\n\nFrom what we can tell, even though Jesse, Denice, as well as John have all grown up to have differnt lives of their own, they continue to iterate their father and grandfather\u2019s claims. That\u2019s because they know they never would have lied about such aspects, along with the fact their grandfather has left behind a private diary, which they claim is seemingly a treasure map for discovering any secrets that have not fully been exposed to the world. This possibly includes the location of the debris and the truth behind the claims two alien bodies had also been recovered on the fateful day.\n\nComiong to their individual accounts, from what we can tell, Jesse is currently living in California, where he serves as an author and the Co-Founder and Chief Design Officer of Airborne Motorworks. This company is his baby, where he teaches people skills and attitudes that will prepare them for their new responsibilities onboard an aircraft. Unfortunately, though, not much is known about his personal experiences at the moment as he prefers to keep them well away from the limelight.\n\nAs for Denice, she is actually a resident of Los Angeles, California, where she has been serving as the State Section Director MUFON Los Angeles, a position she has proudly held since 1983. As for her personal lfie, it appears as if she is currently in a happy, healthy long-term relationship with Jim FitzGerald, a former announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers., and is also a dog mom. She and her brother both continue to talk about Rosewell to ensure that this incident goes down in history as one of the most memorable events to have happened in what they believe to be UFO history.\n\nRead More: Barry Fitzgerald: Where is the Paranormal Investigator Now?\n\n"

Learn More\n\nAs the generative AI continues to progress, having a simple chatbot may no longer be enough for many enterprises.\n\nCloud hyperscalers are racing to build up their databases and tools to help enterprises deploy operational data quickly and efficiently, letting them build applications that are both intelligent and contextually aware.\n\nCase in point: Google Cloud\u2019s recent barrage of updates for multiple database offerings, starting with AlloyDB.\n\nAccording to a blog post from the company, the fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database now supports ScaNN (scalable nearest neighbor) vector index in general availability. The technology powers its Search and YouTube services and paves the way for faster index creation and vector queries while consuming far less memory.\n\nIn addition, the company also announced a partnership with Aiven for the managed deployment of AlloyDB as well as updates for Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase.\n\nUnderstanding the value of ScaNN for AlloyDB\n\nVector databases are critical to power advanced AI workloads, right from RAG chatbots to recommender systems.\n\nAt the heart of these systems sit key capabilities like storing and managing vector embeddings (numerical representation of data) and conducting similarity searches needed for the targeted applications.\n\nAs most developers in the world prefer PostgreSQL as the go-to operational database, its extension for vector search, pgvector, has become highly popular. Google Cloud already supports it on AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, with a state-of-the-art graph-based algorithm called Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) handling vector jobs.\n\nHowever, on occasions where the vector workload is too large, the performance of the algorithm may decline, leading to application latencies and high memory usage.\n\nTo address this, Google Cloud is making ScaNN vector index in AlloyDB generally available. This new index uses the same technology that powers Google Search and YouTube to deliver up to four times faster vector queries and up to eight-fold faster index build times, with a 3-4x smaller memory footprint than the HNSW index in standard PostgreSQL.\n\n\u201cThe ScaNN index is the first PostgreSQL-compatible index that can scale to support more than one billion vectors while maintaining state-of-the-art query performance \u2014 enabling high-performance workloads for every enterprise,\u201d Andi Gutmans, the GM and VP of engineering for Databases at Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGutmans also announced a partnership with Aiven to make AlloyDB Omni, the downloadable edition of AlloyDB, available as a managed service that runs anywhere, including on-premises or on the cloud.\n\n\u201cYou can now run transactional, analytical, and vector workloads across clouds on a single platform, and easily get started building gen AI applications, also on any cloud. This is the first partnership that adds an administration and management layer for AlloyDB Omni,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase?\n\nIn addition to AlloyDB, Google Cloud announced enhancements for Memorystore for Valkey, the fully managed cluster for the Valkey in-memory database, and the Firebase application development platform.\n\nFor the Valkey offering, the company said it is adding vector search capabilities. Gutmans noted that a single Memorystore for Valkey instance can now perform similarity search at single-digit millisecond latency on over a billion vectors, with more than 99% recall.\n\nHe also added that the next version of Memorystore for Valkey, 8.0, is now in public preview with 2x faster querying speed as compared to Memorystore for Redist Cluster, a new replication scheme, networking enhancements and detailed visibility into performance and resource usage.\n\nAs for Firebase, Google Cloud is adding Data Connect, a new backend-as-a-service that will be integrated with a fully managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It will go into public preview later this year.\n\nWith these developments, Google Cloud hopes developers will have a broader selection of infrastructure and database capabilities \u2014 along with powerful language models \u2013 to build intelligent applications for their organizations. It remains to be seen how these new advancements are deployed to real use cases, but the general trend indicates the volume of gen AI applications is expected to soar significantly.\n\nOmdia estimates that the market for generative AI applications will grow from $6.2 billion in 2023 to $58.5 billion in 2028, marking a CAGR of 56%."

While the tipster didn\u2019t share details about the new feature, Samsung is likely implementing a Google Photos-like Ask Photos functionality. Ask Photos is powered by Gemini and allows users to search the Photos app for specific images in a natural, descriptive way. For example, you can search for things like, \u201cphotos of me and my dog playing catch.\u201d\n\nAI Search would be a welcome improvement for Samsung\u2019s Gallery app, which has been seen as somewhat lacking. Recently, the company has made efforts to enhance the experience, notably with the One UI 6.1 update, which brought in a range of Google-inspired AI editing tools. The addition of this new AI Search feature could help elevate the Gallery app further, making it a more compelling alternative to Google Photos.\n\nStay with Android Authority for more details about the One UI 7 update.

However, the episode also acquaints them with various other professionals in the field of the paranormal and the unknown, such as Barry Fitzgerald. As he talks about his views on the subject, questions about his whereabouts arise in the minds of the viewers.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald\u2019s Expertise in the Field of Paranormal Has Allowed Him to Explore Other Avenues\n\nBorn in 1972 in the city of Lisburn in Northern Ireland, Barry Fitzgerald allegedly experienced supernatural occurrences in his early days, leading him to form an interest in the unknown. After completing his education, he reportedly worked at the Southern Education and Library Board as the warden. Given his affinity towards the paranormal, he got into the field of paranormal research and worked for a couple of paranormal groups in Northern Ireland. With more than thirty years of experience as a paranormal investigator, he has encountered all kinds of cases, including ancient tombs, myths, hidden spiritual doorways, and legends.\n\nMoreover, Barry has been featured on several TV shows over the years, including \u2018Destination Truth,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Hunters,\u2019 and SyFy\u2019s \u2018Ghost Hunters International.\u2019 In 2016, rumors about him disappearing during his search for a Neolithic doorway to another world were spread. However, he denied these to be true when he featured on the podcast \u2018Stirring the Cauldron.\u2019 Thanks to his expertise in the field, he started writing books based on the paranormal and the unknown, such as \u2018The Influence,\u2019 \u2018Banshee,\u2019 \u2018Searching the Sidhe,\u2019 and \u2018The Mist of Gods.\u2019 He has also co-authored a book with Brian Allan \u2014 \u2018The Deception Of Gods And Men.\u2019\n\nGiven his experience as a television personality, Barry Fitzgerald co-hosts \u2018Project Doorway\u2019 with Steve Mera, another renowned paranormal investigator. When he is not busy with that, he spends his time researching new investigative techniques. The paranormal investigator also has other hobbies, like cooking. In February 2024, he traveled to Albert Halls Bolton in Manchester to attend the Awakenings event, where the attendees discussed the dark side of ufology.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald and His Loving Wife Are Proud Dog Parents\n\nFrom what we can tell, Barry Fitzgerald knows how to strike a balance between his personal and professional life. He shares a great bond with his loving wife, Donna, and is committed to nurturing the fulfilling life they have built together in the quaint town of Sligo in the northern part of Ireland. The duo loves to embark on trips across the globe to feast their eyes on stunning landscapes and have amazing experiences. When they\u2019re back home, they often stop by their local pub to sip on a large glass of cold Guinness and share some laughs with friends. Even after so many years of being together, Donna and Barry still appear to be deeply in love with each other. They haven\u2019t welcomed any kids of their own into the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean their love for their furry babies isn\u2019t unconditional.\n\nAn avid animal lover and a dog dad, Barry went on multiple adventures with his snowy white baby, Max, for several years until his passing. The \u201cmystery legend seeker\u201d passed into the land of rainbows a few years ago, leaving a giant hole in the hearts of the pair. Though one can\u2019t truly move on from the loss of a dear one, in a post he shared in January 2024, Barry revealed that he has found a companion as precious as Max to accompany him on his adventures. Alongside an adorable picture of his furry baby, Barry wrote, \u201cMeena has crept into the hole left by Max, I\u2019ll be forever broken by his death but Meena is a ball of life and mischief to keep me distracted.\u201d The heartwarming caption is a testament to his love for Meena and how she has impacted his life.\n\nBarry\u2019s love for canines runs so deep that he doesn\u2019t hesitate to show up for them in any part of the world if needed. In fact, he flew to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in March 2024 to attend Pawtographs Parafest 5, a paranormal convention held by Pawtographs for Pooches to raise money for a local animal shelter. Interestingly, exploring the realm of the paranormal to unearth new claims is not the only thing that sparks joy in Barry Fitzgerald\u2019s life. Aside from the purported elements of the unknown, nature\u2019s beautiful gifts also pique the interest of the paranormal investigator, and he regularly shares his findings with the world via his social media profiles. Accompanying him on his escapades in the peaceful embrace of nature is, of course, his baby, Meena.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

In order to put his abilities to the test, Paranormal Specialist Steve Mera joined Don on numerous of his paranormal projects and claimed that he witnessed his conversations with the spirit on the recording device. Despite Don being the focal point of the majority of the episode, Steve still manages to invoke several questions in the minds of the viewers.\n\nSteve Mera Has Accomplished a Lot in the Field of UFOs and Paranormal\n\nThe subject of UFOs and the Paranormal has fascinated Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera from his early childhood, so much so that he ended up making a career out of it. However, before he made a name for himself in the community, he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering from North Trafford College and GEC Electrical after passing out from Wellington Boys Secondary School. Meanwhile, he ensured that he gave some time to his passion and carried out consistent research on UFOs and the Paranormal, which would prove to be vital in his future. By 1989, his efforts got him a job at NATO as a Telecommunications Officer before working at MAPIT (Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team) and BUFORA (British UFO Research Association).\n\nA few years later, Steve created the BITC (British Investigators Training Course) in Anomalous Phenomena, which turned out to be a huge success across the United Kingdom. The 1990s were quite productive in his professional career as he reformed MAPIT and helped in the launch of MARA (Merseyside Anomalies Research Association) and NUFORA (The National UFO Research Association). Around 1996, he also launched the SEP (Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology) and worked in the para-psychological departments. By 1998, he had completed the Pre-Degree Psychology at South Trafford College, Manchester, and the BSY Parapsychology Course. He has also worked with Parkway Green Housing Association and Zohar Entertainment Group as a UAP Geological Research and Paranormal Specialist.\n\nIn 2017, he also co-founded ONSTELLAR. Steve also earned his degree in Human Behavioral Psychology from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Steve has also been a part of more than 90 TV shows and radio stations throughout his career, thanks to his expertise in the field of UFOs and the Paranormal. Not only that, he has worked with more than 300 different publications across the world and written for numerous TV shows. Some of the shows he has worked on are \u2018Conspiracy Corner,\u2019 \u2018The X-Files,\u2019 \u2018The Late Night Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018The Scream Team,\u2019 \u2018The Great Unexplained Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018UFO Hunters,\u2019 The Afterlife,\u2019 and more. As for the magazines that have featured his articles, some of them are \u2018UFO Review,\u2019 \u2018UFO News UK,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Voices,\u2019 \u2018Naro Minded,\u2019 \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u2018UFO Magazine,\u2019 \u2018Alien Encounters,\u2019 \u2018Sightings,\u2019 and many more.\n\nWhile he is currently handling his responsibilities as the owner and editor of Phenomena Magazine, Steve also stays busy with running MAPIT and SEP. Having written three books \u2014 \u2018The A-Z of the Unknown,\u2019 \u2018Strange Happenings: Memoirs of a Paranormal Investigator,\u2019 and \u2018Paranormal Insight: A Concise Study of the Strange and Profound\u2019 \u2014 the Paranormal Specialist is also reportedly working on a couple of new books, which would revolve around the UFO Phenomena. On September 30, 2024, Steve conducted a Birmingham UFO Group meeting at the Hot Shots Snooker Club function room at 100 Crosswells Road in Oldbury, Birmingham. In the same month, he also featured as a guest in a podcast called \u2018Paranormal Pendle.\u2019\n\nSteve Mera is Also a Dedicated Partner and Friend\n\nOriginally from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, England, Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera leads a content life on the personal front. After all, he has been navigating life\u2019s ups and downs with his one true love, Jackie Heighway, for over a decade now. Though neither of the two has shared when they fell in love, we know that their paths crossed in 2011 in Bolton, and it was in the same year, on November 28, that they turned their fondness for each other into a full-fledged relationship. Together, the two have seemingly built a beautiful world of their own in Greater Manchester, UK, with trust, care, understanding, and loads of love. Jackie is a Salford native who has been self-employed since 2018. Steve has her biggest cheerleader in Jackie, who makes sure she has his back every step of the way. Whether it is accompanying Steve on his research trips or sharing details about his talks, Jackie does everything to showcase her support for her partner.\n\nFrom what we can tell, Steve seemingly has a daughter named Jenny from a previous relationship. However, not much is known about her. For the uninitiated, Steve is also a huge animal lover and got his first pet in 1997. Losing a pet leaves a huge void in the lives of pet parents and sadly, Steve and Jackie had to experience that pain and grief when their beloved cat, Lucy, crossed over the rainbow bridge in August 2024. \u201cWe will never forget you. You were a huge part of our family. We will meet again one day,\u201d wrote Jackie announcing Lucy\u2019s departure from this world. Though they\u2019ll always miss Lucy, Steve and Jackie are grateful they got to create so many beautiful memories with her.\n\nWhen Steve is not investing his time in furthering his passion, the paranormal specialist enjoys spending time with his family and friends. Even today, he continues to impart all the knowledge he has gathered from his decades of extensive research with the world by setting up meetings and talks every now and then. He also keeps his admirers updated and captivated by sharing his insights on a regular basis on his YouTube channel. Apart from spending time with the love of his life, Jackie, and embarking on trips with her, Steve also looks forward to hanging out with his friends.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA student's drawing and theory of how a Portuguese Moth Fly was found in their Australian schoolyard. Credit: CSIRO\n\nMore than 60% of Australia's known insects are unnamed and a mystery to science. Of an estimated 500,000 Australian species, roughly half are insects, but many aren't categorized.\n\nA group of sharp-eyed school students from Queensland is changing that. With the guidance of their dedicated teachers and enthusiastic experts, they've helped lift the lid on the secrets of two more insect species.\n\nThe Year 4 students from Yeronga State expected to find various insects in their Malaise insect trap. A tiny fly, first identified in a botanical garden in Portugal and unrecorded in Australia, was not one of them.\n\nExpert analysis found that some of the fly's DNA sequences were nearly identical to a moth fly species, Alepia viatrix. They sent specimens to Germany for testing, where scientists confirmed the fly's Alepia viatrix identity. It was far from home.\n\nThe students sketched and labeled the insect, and discussed their theories of how this fly came to be in their backyard. Popular theories included it swimming the distance, stowing away on a shipping container, or attempting world domination.\n\nThis work became part of a paper published in the journal Check List. The authors suggest the fly likely made its 18,000-km journey to Australia by hitchhiking in a bromeliad.\n\nFortunately, experts expect the fly to be harmless for Australia's environment. Its discovery highlights the importance of community involvement and citizen science.\n\nTaking the sting out of armyworm invasion\n\nMore recently, students from Yeronga and five other schools each collected a new wasp species in their Malaise traps. The discovered wasp is a natural enemy to the fall armyworm, a destructive cereal crop pest that entered Australian agriculture in 2020.\n\nBecause their wasp was unnamed and undescribed, students got to workshop potential names for the newly recognized species. Researchers credit the students and described the shared naming process in a journal article published in Austral Entomology.\n\nThe students' wasp discoveries and information gathered will be useful to the Queensland Government's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Knowing the wasps' locations will assist scientists researching solutions to armyworm population control, aiding Australian agriculturalists and farmers.\n\nOpening doors to science\n\nThe learning opportunities came from a partnership between teacher Clare Triggell from Yeronga State School and entomologist Dr. Andy Howe from the University of the Sunshine Coast. Thanks to their collaboration, students got a unique chance to learn about insect taxonomy, biodiversity, conservation and biosecurity.\n\nTriggell and Howe have been working as partners for more than three years through our STEM Professionals in Schools program. The initiative pairs Australian teachers with science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) professionals, connecting curriculum and real-life industry and research.\n\nDr. Howe helped make learning activities even more meaningful by basing some exercises on the citizen science projects of Insect Investigators. This school-based program teams up scientists with schools to discover, document and describe Australia's biodiversity. Through the program, Yeronga State School students have joined other emerging scientists around Australia. Together, they've named 17 new insect species and documented 5,000 species using DNA.\n\nThe Australian Museum celebrated Insect Investigators' efforts with a Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2024. Dr. Howe says the enthusiasm of all the teachers and students involved drove the Eureka's shared achievement.\n\n\"Working with Clare is wonderful. She eagerly facilitates hands-on learning and has taught me how it works best in schools,\" Dr. Howe says.\n\n\"The partnerships to increase teacher capability, as well as the students, in a new STEM area, and I've seen that here. Last year, teachers ran their own insect trapping and monitoring exercise with minimal input from me. I can't wait to learn what they discover next.\"\n\nMore information: Santiago Jaume-Schinkel et al, The hitchhiker's guide to Australia: the 18,000-km-long journey of Alepia viatrix Jaume-Schinkel, Kvifte, Weele & Mengual, 2022 (Diptera, Psychodidae) discovered through citizen science, Check List (2023).

        "article_content": "The lending industry has been undergoing significant transformation in recent years, driven by shifts in consumer expectations, tighter regulations, and fierce competition. Traditional financial institutions are now facing pressure to innovate and streamline their lending processes, across loan origination, loan servicing and collections, while fintech companies are offering more agile and tailored solutions. In the midst of these changes, Low-Code, No-Code, and Pro-Code (LcNcPc) platforms have emerged as key enablers, allowing organisations to quickly adapt and launch new solutions in response to market demands. According to Gartner, growing enterprise wide hyper-automation and composable business initiatives to be the key drivers for adoption of low code technologies.\n\nThese platforms provide a flexible approach to application development. Low-Code and No-Code (LcNc) platforms empower non-technical users to create functional applications with minimal coding, while Pro-Code offers deeper customisation for more complex needs. This trifecta is accelerating the transformation in the lending industry, allowing both traditional institutions and fintech startups to meet consumer needs faster, reduce development costs and stay compliant with evolving regulations.\n\nPro-Code: Driving Customisation and Performance\n\nWhile Low-Code and No-Code platforms are designed to streamline application development and empower non-technical users, Pro-Code remains critical for financial institutions that need highly customised, secure, and scalable solutions. Here are the key benefits of incorporating Pro-Code into the LCNC platform:\n\nDeep Customisation for Complex Needs\n\nPro-Code allows institutions to build custom features that go beyond the pre-configured components available in Low-Code and No-Code environments. Banks and Financial Institutions (Fis), for instance, can use Pro-Code to create highly specific tools, such as customised risk assessment engines or dynamic pricing models, tailored to their unique business requirements. Scalability for Enterprise Solutions\n\nWhile Low-Code and No-Code platforms are excellent for rapid prototyping and building smaller applications, Pro-Code is essential for handling enterprise-level scale. Financial institutions often require complex systems capable of handling large volumes of transactions, real-time data processing, and high-level performance, all of which can be achieved with Pro-Code. Enhanced Security and Compliance\n\nPro-Code offers the flexibility to integrate advanced security features and customise compliance-related workflows. Financial institutions face stringent regulatory requirements, and Pro-Code platforms allow developers to build systems that meet these standards, such as custom encryption, advanced access controls, and compliance auditing. Complex Integrations\n\nPro-Code provides the capability to integrate with legacy systems, third-party applications, and APIs in a highly tailored manner. This ensures that banks can modernise their infrastructure without completely replacing their core systems, allowing for gradual digital transformation. Optimising AI/ML Models\n\nPro-Code allows banks to integrate advanced AI and machine learning models into their operations, providing predictive analytics, fraud detection, and data-driven decision-making tools. These customised models can enhance core functions like credit scoring, loan approvals, and personalised product recommendations, making operations smarter and more efficient.\n\nWhere GenAI Comes In\n\nThe rise of GenAI further enhances the capability of Low-Code, No-Code, and Pro-Code platforms, enabling businesses to build smarter, more adaptable tools. One of the most powerful ways to harness GenAI within LCNC platforms is through prompt engineering.\n\nPrompt Engineering: The Power to Build Without Code\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of using natural language inputs to interact with and guide GenAI systems. In the context of LCNC platforms, this means that users, regardless of technical expertise, can build, customise, and deploy applications simply by crafting precise prompts. Here are the key benefits of prompt engineering within LCNC platforms:\n\nFaster Tool Creation and Automation\n\nWith prompt engineering, users can rapidly create tools by instructing GenAI in plain language. For example, a user could input a prompt like, \u201cCreate a tool that automatically verifies loan applicants' income using bank statements,\u201d and the LCNC platform, powered by GenAI, will generate the necessary logic and workflows to achieve this. This significantly reduces development time and allows teams to automate complex tasks without writing any code. Democratising Development\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of prompt engineering is its ability to democratise application development. Business users, compliance officers, or customer service teams, who may not have coding skills, can still create functional applications by providing clear instructions through prompts. This empowers more people within a financial institution to contribute to the digital transformation process, leading to quicker innovation and responsiveness to market needs. Real-Time Customisations\n\nGenAI, when guided by well-structured prompts, can help users create tools that adapt in real-time to changing business conditions or customer needs. For instance, a bank can prompt GenAI to \u201cCreate a dynamic loan calculator that updates based on current market interest rates and customer credit scores,\u201d allowing the institution to offer tailored services at scale, without manual intervention. Seamless Integration and Flexibility\n\nPrompt engineering allows for the easy creation of connectors and integrations with legacy systems or third-party platforms. A simple prompt like, \u201cGenerate a tool to sync loan application data with the CRM system,\u201d can trigger GenAI to create the necessary APIs or data pipelines. This flexibility ensures that financial institutions can modernize their operations without overhauling their existing infrastructure, saving time and reducing dependency on external vendors. Enhanced Testing and Prototyping\n\nPrompt engineering enables rapid prototyping within the LCNC platform. By providing prompts such as, \u201cBuild a prototype for a risk assessment tool based on customer transaction history,\u201d teams can quickly generate working models, test them, and iterate as needed. This accelerates the innovation process and allows banks to quickly bring new ideas to market while maintaining high-quality standards. Cost Efficiency and Resource Optimisation\n\nBy reducing the need for deep technical resources and external development teams, prompt engineering directly contributes to cost efficiency. Non-technical teams can build, deploy, and update tools without the heavy costs associated with traditional software development. This frees up skilled developers to focus on more critical, high-value projects that require complex coding, while everyday tasks are handled through automated or semi-automated processes.\n\nThe Impact of LCNCPC Platforms on the Lending Industry\n\nThe financial landscape, especially in lending, is becoming increasingly competitive. Traditional banks and financial institutions (FIs) are under immense pressure to deliver faster, more personalised services while maintaining compliance with complex regulations. LCNCPC platforms offer significant advantages in key areas:\n\nCost Efficiency\n\nLCNCPC platforms significantly reduce development costs. No-Code and Low-Code solutions empower non-technical staff to develop applications, reducing the need for expensive IT resources. Pro-Code platforms allow specialised teams to focus on high-priority projects, streamlining operations and reducing overhead. Vendor Dependency\n\nVendor lock-in is a major concern for banks, but LCNCPC platforms provide a solution. Many platforms promote interoperability and modularity, allowing banks to integrate external APIs and build custom functionalities without relying entirely on one vendor. Pro-Code ensures that banks retain control over critical aspects of their systems. Swift Deployments\n\nSpeed to market is crucial in the financial industry. LCNCPC platforms allow rapid prototyping and deployment of digital solutions. With No-Code tools, banks can make adjustments to workflows or build small applications, enabling faster service rollouts, such as loan application portals or customer onboarding tools. Enhanced Customer Experience\n\nCustomer satisfaction in lending depends on simplicity and speed. LCNCPC platforms enable banks to create personalised, digital-first loan experiences. With GenAI, banks can further enhance this by analysing customer profiles and offering tailored loan options in real time. For instance, the platform can be used to design highly personalised loan repayment plans that cater to individual borrower needs, fostering customer loyalty. Compliance and Regulatory Adaptability\n\nAs regulatory changes continue to evolve, LCNCPC platforms help banks stay compliant. Low-Code and No-Code platforms allow for quick updates to workflows in response to new regulations. Pro-Code can be used to build advanced compliance monitoring and reporting systems. GenAI also plays a role in automating compliance checks and generating reports. Seamless Integration with Legacy Systems\n\nLCNCPC platforms integrate easily with existing legacy systems, allowing banks to modernise without overhauling their entire infrastructure. Low-Code platforms can bridge new digital services and traditional banking systems, while Pro-Code supports deeper integrations for more complex solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe emergence of Low-Code, No-Code, and Pro-Code platforms offers banks and financial institutions a powerful way to drive innovation, enhance customer experiences, and stay compliant with ever-evolving regulatory requirements. By adopting a phased approach, financial institutions can reap the benefits of new age lending technology with LcNcPc capabilities while minimising risks and controlling costs of their lending operations. Integrating GenAI further amplifies the efficiency and flexibility of these platforms, positioning the lending industry for a future where digital transformation is not just an option but a necessity."

The app is already equipped with an AI assistant and is piloting an enterprise product offering.\n\n\"The battle for offline attention is the next big thing in consumer,\" Dunn told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid a loneliness epidemic declared by US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and social-media users growing jaded with online life, startups like Posh (a sort of TikTok feed for events) and 222 (a way to meet strangers via dinners or events) have also raised venture capital this year with apps aiming to help people find friends.\n\nPie recently announced that it raised a $11.5 million Series A led by Forerunner Ventures' Kirsten Green. The round also included participation from Chicago-based fund Origin Ventures and Twitter cofounder Ev Williams. Its latest round puts Pie's total capital raised at $24 million, per the company.\n\nBuilding and growing an app for making friends\n\nLike many startups, Pie has had to pivot. It launched in 2020 as a friend matchmaking app, akin to a Bumble Friends experience.\n\n\"We got a lot of matching, a lot of profile browse, but no one would reach out to the other person,\" Dunn said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter reading Dr. Marisa Fanco's book \"Platonic,\" Dunn said he went back to the drawing board. Scrolling through potential friends wasn't going to cut it \u2014 it had to be recurring group hangouts to help people meet and stay connected.\n\nWith a team of 10 Chicago-based staffers, Pie doubled down on building an IRL app and using the city as a testing ground.\n\n\"Chicago doesn't have the saturation of consumer apps you have in New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco,\" Dunn said.\n\nIn February and March, the startup began testing local, curated events, dubbed \"Pie Originals,\" in Chicago, such as a monthly silent book club or a bi-monthly \"Dudes Getting Pancakes\" hangout. Dunn credits the app's growth to this strategy. It hit 20,000 monthly active users in six months of testing the Pie Originals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal event creators, like Mary Doctor, who hosts a show-and-tell event for adults, have used Pie to gather people and make money.\n\n\"There's this whole creator economy of people who want to bring people together in person,\" Dunn added.\n\nWith its Series A capital, Pie is rolling out a creator fund for event hosts, which pays $5 to the creator for every RSVP to an event (all of which are free for attendees).\n\nThe startup plans to experiment with different monetization models, eyeing a potential freemium model that apps like Bumble and Hinge have opted for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is venture-backed startups,\" Dunn said, adding that by the time of Pie's Series B, it will have a monetization engine locked down. \"You have costs, and then you figure out revenues later.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dunn is betting on Pie's Gen-Z staff and the app's user growth, which stands at 40% month-over-month.\n\nRead the 31-page pitch deck that Andy Dunn used to raise Pie's Series A:\n\nNote: Pie has redacted details and amended some pages so that the document could be shared externally."

        "article_content": "Rosh Hashanah, one of the most important days on the Hebrew calendar, is this week. It marks the beginning of the new year and celebrates the creation of the world. It's also the start of the Jewish High Holy Days leading up to the Jewish day of atonement, Yom Kippur.\n\nRosh Hashanah is translated from Hebrew to mean the \u201chead\u201d of the year. It\u2019s commemorated with special prayers, foods, gatherings and more.\n\n\"These are moments where we come together as a community, where we take time to think about ourselves as individuals, but also think about the ways that we can help others,\" Rabbi Rob Gleisser, the Peter J. Rubinstein reform senior Jewish educator at Penn State Hillel, told USA TODAY. \"Think about the ways that we want to create a safe community, a welcoming community, a warm community and then be able to enrich the world around us after having those moments of introspection.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Rosh Hashanah 2024:\n\nWhen is Rosh Hashanah 2024?\n\nThe exact date varies every year since it is based on the Hebrew calendar, where Rosh Hashanah begins on the first day of the seventh month. It is almost always in September or October.\n\nThis year it starts on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2024 at sundown, and ends at sunset on Oct. 4, 2024.\n\nThe celebration of the new year is the only Jewish holiday that is two days long both inside and outside Israel. It\u2019s called yoma arichta, translated as \u201ca long day\u201d because the 48-hour celebration may be thought of as one extended day.\n\nHow to celebrate Rosh Hashanah\n\nMany people attend services at synagogues and other community spaces for worship on Rosh Hashanah. Jewish congregations with recite special prayers and songs to mark the new year.\n\nSome communities will blow a curved ram's horn called a Shofar.\n\nThe Shofar at Temple Israel of Brevard, located at 7300 Lake Andrew Drive in Viera.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to kind of stir you, awaken you to the idea of thinking of new year, taking stock, preparing to atone, and in the month leading up to Rosh Hashanah it begins to be used as a kind of wake up,\u201d said, Jordan Rosenblum, the Belzer Professor of Classical Judaism and Max and Frieda Weinstein-Bascom Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt really kind of pierces the air, and you can't ignore it.\u201d\n\nSome Jews may also pray near a body of water in a Tashlich ceremony, in addition to tossing pieces of bread or other food into the water to symbolize sending off sins.\n\nWhy is Rosh Hashanah celebrated?\n\nRosh Hashanah is often treated as a time to reflect on the previous year and focus on hopes for the coming year, according to Rosenblum.\n\n\u201cIt's the beginning of the Jewish calendar, and like all new years there are, it\u2019s a time for sort of taking stock, right? ... What do I want to improve? You know, the equivalent of joining the gym in January,\u201d he said.\n\nRosh Hashanah is also important for some Jewish people as a celebration of the creation of humanity. It may be referred to as the \"birthday of the world,\" marking the time when God created \u2013 or when the breath of life entered \u2013 Adam and Eve.\n\nWhat are some traditional foods eaten during Rosh Hashanah?\n\nRosh Hashanah celebrations don\u2019t just take place within the walls of a synagogue. Many Jews will gather with friends and family to eat special foods and hold commemorations:\n\nSome Jewish people eat apples and honey together to represent a sweet new year.\n\nPeople may also eat challah, a braided bread, in a round loaf to represent a cycle of the year.\n\nPomegranate seeds also represent the 613 mitzvot, or commandments, that are cited in the Torah, the Jewish holy book.\n\n\"For Rosh Hashanah, in particular, there's just a lot of emphasis on sweetness so that you are stepping into the year with good tastes and good feelings, and with this idea that you want to have a sweet and bountiful year ahead,\" Rabbi Danielle Leshaw, senior educator and campus support director for Hillel International, told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is the Rosh Hashanah greeting?\n\nHappy Rosh Hashanah or happy new year are both appropriate greetings if you are talking to Jewish friends, family, co-workers, or classmates around the holiday.\n\nYou can also say shanah tovah, which means good year in Hebrew.\n\n\"Happy New Year is great,\" Gleisser said. \"Happy Rosh Hashanah, that\u2019s a beautiful thing to say.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Akron Beacon Journal: When does Rosh Hashanah start?"

Such software programmes are more adept at solving multistep problems in fields such as maths and computer programming.\n\nAI researchers are pursuing reasoning models as they search for the next significant step forward in the technology. Like OpenAI, Google is trying to approximate human reasoning using a technique known as chain-of-thought prompting, according to two of the people. In this technique, which Google pioneered, the software pauses for a matter of seconds before responding to a written prompt while, behind the scenes and invisible to the user, it considers a number of related prompts and then summarises what appears to be the best response.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the effort.\n\nAdvanced mathematical reasoning is a critical capability for modern AI, according to Google DeepMind.

It seems the issue is resolved with the iOS 18.1 betas, but with the release of iOS 18.0.1, everyday users will also be able to avoid the problem.\n\nResolving the iPadOS 18 bug will help many folks who recently spent a lot of money on a new iPad Pro only to find their tablets unusable. After installing iPadOS 18, the bug caused bricking on the 11-inch and 13-inch M4 iPad Pro (2024) models. Soon after the bug was identified, Apple pulled the iPadOS 18 update for anyone with an M4 iPad Pro.\n\nWith these bug fixes hopefully resolved soon, Apple\u2019s attention can finally turn to the release of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1. These software updates will be the first to include pieces of Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple Intelligence, announced in June, is the company\u2019s first foray into artificial intelligence. Though initially expected to launch with the iPhone 16 series in September, Apple delayed the launch this summer. As a result, parts of Apple Intelligence will be released piecemeal across multiple software updates, such as iOS 18.1, 18.2, etc.\n\nThe iOS 18.1 betas released to developers and members of Apple\u2019s public beta community include Apple Intelligence-powered components like Siri improvements, writing tool updates, and more. The first official version of iOS 18.1 should be released before the end of October, with iOS 18.2 available before the end of the year.\n\nLate in September, MacRumors was the first site to say Apple was expected to launch iOS 18.0.1 soon."
