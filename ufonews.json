            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

When you get a bunch of notifications from one app, the feature summarizes the content of all notifications in one card that appears on the lock screen. You can dismiss the stack after you have read the summary, or tap on it to check out individual notifications.\n\nHowever, the feature is not always accurate. Occasionally, it results in hilarious outcomes, and other times it fails to properly sum up the content of the notifications and includes visible inaccuracies. If you think notification summaries are causing confusion rather than being useful, you can turn them off or customize them.\n\nOn iPhone/iPad\n\nHead to Settings > Notifications and tap on the Summarize Notifications tab. There are two options: You can turn off AI-powered notification summaries for all apps by toggling the Summarize Notifications option at the top, or you can turn off notifications on a per-app basis.\n\nOn Mac\n\nClick on the Apple menu in the top left corner and go to System Settings > Notifications. Click the Summarize Notifications tab, then turn Summarize Notifications off. Similar to the iPhone/iPad settings options, you can turn off notification summaries for select apps.\n\nThere is no way to turn off notification summaries for a specific app category, such as news, productivity, utility, shopping, travel, and finance.\n\nApple said in January that it would issue a software update to better indicate that notification summaries are generated by AI and might have some errors."

            "article_content": "Jenny Agutter has hit back at fellow cast members who think the set of Call the Midwife is haunted - but admits she sometimes feels she could be \u201cswallowed up\u201d by the ancient ground in Cornwall.\n\nAnd the veteran actress, 72, believes the BBC drama\u2019s enduring success is down to being rooted in realism - calling out so-called \u201creality\u201d shows as being anything but. Rebecca Gethings, who plays the drama\u2019s Sister Veronica, admitted before Christmas that she has to be accompanied on bathroom breaks during filming on the Surrey set because she finds the corridor to the toilets so spooky.\n\nThe actress also told how, during filming of series 14 last year, the show\u2019s medic took a photo into the darkness having heard a bang. \u201cIf you zoom in, it's a lady in an Edwardian kind of costume, holding what looks to be a pig,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cI've seen the photo and it's pretty compelling.\u201d\n\nImage: BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay) BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay)\n\nBut Jenny, who has been in the drama since it launched in 2012 as head nun Sister Julienne, said she is not convinced. \u201cI don't feel spooked. I've been to much, much spookier places, to tell you the truth,\u201d she told the Mirror. \u201cWhen I'm in Cornwall, which I absolutely love, I'm in a house that's very old.\n\n\"The house doesn't spook me - but what does is a sense that I could turn around and everything might have disappeared. That I'm back in an ancient time where the rocks and the place belong and I don't any longer; that it's all gone. And that's not ghosts or spirits. It's a sense of the ground being so ancient that it can swallow me up.\u201d\n\nJenny and her Swedish husband Johan Tham have lived in Cornwall for more than 30 years. She first visited the county in 1976 to make The Eagle Has Landed alongside Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. Agreeing that when it comes to paranormal activity she is a skeptic, Jenny explained there are usually rational explanations.\n\n\u201cI do think that we have very, very strong imaginations,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe that the sense of time can slip and warp. I think that with the paranormal, there are things that we can't explain - but I don't see them as being ghosts, spirits and those things. We all love a good ghost story. We love to be made to feel, \u2018Oh, there's something else that goes on.\u2019 But I like to actually know what's real and what's not and draw a line somewhere.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage: BBC/Neal Street Productions) BBC/Neal Street Productions) Image: BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston) BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston)\n\nShe said one of the reasons for Call the Midwife\u2019s ongoing success, with a loyal audience of 7million regularly tuning in, was that writer Heidi Thomas always roots her stories in realism. \u201cReality shows are so unreal,\u201d she complained. The people in those are so unreal and the way they look at life is completely unreal. What we have [on Call the Midwife] is something that is dealing with reality, but it heightens it and the drama's there.\u201d\n\nThis current series has seen the action in Poplar move into the 1970s and Jenny, 72, said it felt very different to when the series kicked off, based on the memoir of Jennifer Worth, set in 1957. \u201cIt\u2019s moving forward in time and there's new stories and the new times and new fashions and new music. It's always feeling different, we\u2019re not just repeating things.\u201d\n\nThe actress said that her own memories of 1970 - just as she was signed up as a teen to appear in her breakthrough film Walkabout - are a world apart. \u201cMy memory of 1970 is very, very different,\u201d she said. Walkabout, filmed in South Africa, was released in 1971 and includes a famous scene in which her character swims nude.\n\nIn the upcoming episodes, Sister Julienne is having to battle once again to save Nonnatus House, with officials arguing that nuns delivering babies are no longer relevant, thanks to the NHS. \u201cI don't think she ever questions what they can do. She just questions that they're allowed to do it,\u201d Jenny explained. Realising that she, as a nun, needs help from outside the religious order, she enlists nurse Trixie Franklin (Helen George) to spearhead the campaign to secure Nonnatus\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cShe knows that Trixie is someone who can move and change things and to make it clear to her what the reality is. She still finds it hard that they\u2019re being pushed aside. She's faced all these problems, they've gone through the wars, they've done all these things. And suddenly, when they seem to have a lot, everything's being taken away. So she's very surprised by that.\u201d\n\n- Call the Midwife continues on Sunday, BBC1, 8pm\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."

Their research suggests that the core may have an additional, hidden layer inside it, challenging what scientists have long believed about the planet's structure. This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nChallenging long-standing beliefs\n\nFor decades, Earth has been understood to have four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The inner core, mostly made of iron and nickel, has always been thought to be solid and uniform. However, this new study indicates there could be more to the story.\n\nAlso Read | 230m away from docking- ISRO Spadex satellites are at their closest so far\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSeismic waves reveal new clues\n\nThe team used data from seismic waves\u2014energy waves that travel through the Earth after earthquakes\u2014to study the inner core. They found that these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, suggesting that the inner core might have two layers instead of one. This discovery could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history.\n\nAlso Read | Zuckerberg claims Biden officials would 'scream' to enforce Covid 'censorship' on Facebook\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHints of two cooling events\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings is that the structure of iron inside the inner core might have changed over time. Scientists believe that this could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history. This discovery could explain some inconsistencies seen in earlier models of Earth\u2019s core.\n\nAlso Read | China mulling re-creating \u2018Three Gorges Dam project\u2019 in space. Here is how\n\nData gaps and future research\n\nWhile the results are exciting, the researchers caution that there are still gaps in the data, particularly from polar regions, which could affect the conclusions. Despite this, the study is a major step forward in understanding the mysteries of Earth\u2019s interior."

            "article_content": "San Francisco: Close to two months ago, 26-year-old OpenAI Whistleblower, Suchir Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment under mysterious circumstances; while initially his death was termed as a suicide, his family and some investigative journalists believe it to be a murder. Suchir Balaji's mother, Poornima Rao, in a recent interview, has claimed that her son was not okay with OpenAI becoming \u2018for-profit\u2019. Her interview has been reshared by Elon Musk who has also reacted to it amid his feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n\u2018He Was Not Okay with OpenAI Becoming For-Profit\u2019: Suchir Balaji's Mother\n\nPoornima Rao, Suchir Balaji's mother who has been raising her voice against OpenAI and claiming her son's death to be a murder, has recently made shocking claims in a fresh interview. In a conversation with Mario Nawfal, the OpenAI whistleblower's mother said that her son had joined OpenAI with the belief to help humanity and was not okay with the organisation becoming for-profit.\n\nSuchir Balaji's mother said, \u201cThe reason he joined OpenAI was his belief that AI will help humanity. He was very impressed with OpenAI initially because they were nonprofit. That's when his concern started to arise, and he started questioning himself.\u201d\n\nElon Musk Reshares Interview of Suchir Balaji's Mother, Reacts To Her Shocking Claims\n\nPoornima Rao's interview clip where she is claiming that her son was not happy with OpenAI becoming for-profit, reached Elon Musk as well who shared it on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly known as Twitter). Along with the reshare, he reacted to it with two exclamation marks, \u2018!!\u2019.\n\n\u2018Suchir Balaji Was A Genius\u2019: OpenAI Whistleblower's Mother\n\nIn the same interview, Suchir Balaji's mother talked about how her son was a genius. She said, \u201cWhen he was in high school, for 2 years, every weekend, day and night, he was practicing algorithms. He downloaded data related to machine learning from many different universities. Way before anyone else knew about AI, he was already a champion in machine learning and algorithms. At the age of 11, he started programming. Within 6 months, he used to ask me questions that I could not answer on algorithms.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Acknowledgement from OpenAI of His Contributions\u2019\n\nIn her interview, Suchir Balaji's mother also expressed her sadness because OpenAI never recognised or appreciated her son for his work and contribution to the company, not even after his unfortunate death. She said, \u201cHe did something to fine-tune ChatGPT that made it faster and more efficient. But what bothered him was that there was no recognition for his work until he passed away. Even now, there's no acknowledgement from OpenAI of his contributions. That's very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji's Mother Alleges Murder of Her Son\n\nAmid reports about Suchir Balaji Death Case being a suicide, the 26-year-old boy's mother Poornima Rao has claimed her son's death to be a \u2018cold-blooded murder declared by authorities as suicide\u2019. She further claimed that there was a stark difference between the initial police report and a private autopsy report, that her son's apartment was ransacked and that there were signs of struggle in the bathroom suggesting he was hit and this is not a suicide, but a case of murder.\n\n\u2018This Doesn\u2019t Seems A Suicide': Elon Musk\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has responded to the plea made by the mother of OpenAi Whistleblower Suchir Balaji saying that, \u201cThis doesn't seems a suicide\u201d, in which she called for an FBI investigation following her son's death. Balaji accused the AI gaint of copyright violations, and he was found dead a month after the allegations surfaced.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, his mother, Poornima Ramarao, revealed that they had hired a private investigator and conducted a second autopsy to further investigate the cause of death. According to Ramarao, the private autopsy did not confirm the police's conclusion. In her post, she tagged billionaire Elon Musk and Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom will join the incoming Donald Trump administration and are key ally of president-elect. Mr. Musk, known for his ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, replied to her post, stating, \u201cThis doesn't seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji Case: Controversy Surrounding Indian-American's Death\n\nIndian-American tech researcher Suchir Balaji, 26, who openly criticized the use of copyrighted data in artificial intelligence (AI), was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Balaji, a computer science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, had interned with OpenAI and Scale AI during his college years. He joined OpenAI in 2019 and during his four years at the company, he worked on several projects, including GPT-4 training and improving ChatGPT\u2019s performance. He left OpenAI in August this year, expressing concerns over the potential harm OpenAI could cause. During his tenure, he played a significant role in data collection for OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT. On his personal website, Mr. Balaji elaborated on his concerns, claiming that OpenAI's method of copying data for training its models potentially amounted to copyright infringement.\n\nJust a day before his death, Balaji\u2019s name was mentioned in a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Though details about his involvement remain unclear, his public criticism of the company\u2019s data usage practices likely drew attention to his stance on ethical AI development. Suchir Balaji had accused OpenAI of training its AI models on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorization, a practice he argued was detrimental. \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\" Mr. Balaji said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. The Indian-origin tech professional resigned from OpenAI in October 2023 after nearly four years with the company."

In first place is the seaside Costa del Sol, with return flights going as low as \u00a351.\n\nIt takes roughly the same amount of time to fly to Costa del Sol from London as it does to get you to Manchester via train, only with a hefty price difference as the money-saving experts noted an average one-way train up north costs \u00a354.50. Mallorca also made the list with potential return flights from \u00a362 if you pick your times and dates right.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nOne of the more high profile destinations on the list is the capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague, with return flights starting at \u00a357. Including average hotel prices, cheap and mid-range food to keep you going as well as some beers and coffees over a weekend trip will set you back \u00a3254.27 according to the money experts.\n\nPoland\n\nKrakow comes in third place at \u00a359.50 for return flights and the alternative in Warsaw has a slightly higher premium at \u00a364.30. But both areas also earned a spot on Savoo\u2019s cheapest long weekend getaways in second at \u00a3231.57 and third place with \u00a3242.60 respectively including hotels, food and drinks.\n\nSlovakia\n\nRounding out the top five is Barislava in Slovakia with \u00a363.40 return flights available. The historic city also came in just under Prague for the cheapest weekend getaway, costing roughly \u00a3267.89 for three days and two nights.\n\nFinally, Budapest in Hungary, Vilnius in Lithuania, Riga in Latvia and Lisbon in Portugal rounded out the latter part of the top 10 with return flights ranging between \u00a365 and \u00a371. The experts warned that while hidden gems and lesser-known destinations like Bratislava are likely to have cheaper flights all-year round, there are some ways to bag a bargain on even the most popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe experts shared their top five money-saving tips while booking flights. Starting with the most obvious in avoiding popular dates like Fridays or school holidays when trips are likely to be more expensive due to increased demand.\n\nIf you can be even more flexible with dates, the experts recommended: \u201cLast-minute deals can save you a ton of money. So if you\u2019re brave, try to hold off booking until a couple of weeks before you want to go.\u201d\n\nJust like avoiding popular travel dates, avoiding the popular airports can save some change for your getaway. The experts explained: \u201cConsider an airport close by. For example, if you\u2019re headed to Orlando, you don\u2019t just need to fly into Orlando International Airport. Both Melbourne and Tampa have airports with flights from the UK, which can cost a lot less.\u201d\n\nLayovers generally tend to be cheaper than direct flights, up to 50% in some cases, they claimed, although it is more time-consuming. Using voucher codes, discounts and comparison sites can also earn back some cash for your trip.\n\nOne subtle way to ensure you\u2019re not getting priced out of a getaway is to look for flights using an incognito mode browser tab, the experts recommended. This avoids installing permanent cookies on your browser so you\u2019re less likely to be shown inflated prices sometimes given to people who are consistently browsing some flights."

Los Angeles won six away games this season, a fact that appears to be baked into the spread.\n\nThe Chargers, who rebounded from last season\u2019s last-place finish in the AFC West, led the NFL in scoring defense during the regular season, at 17.7 points per game. Justin Herbert has passed for 10 TDs and no interceptions in his past eight road starts. He finished the regular season strong, passing for two-plus TDs in four consecutive games.\n\nThe Texans dropped two consecutive games, to the Ravens and Chiefs, before closing the regular season with a meaningless win over Tennessee. Baltimore held Houston to two points in the Week 17 loss. In his past five games, C.J. Stroud has not passed for 250 yards, while totaling six TD passes during that span. In three of his past four games, Joe Mixon failed to rush for 30 yards.\n\nIf I were signing up for this FanDuel new user promo I\u2019d make my first bet on the Chargers to cover. Herbert is rolling into the postseason and the Los Angeles defense will certainly hold Stroud down."

            "article_content": "The 2002 RPG Neverwinter Nights is a masterclass in game design. Now 23 years old, the community behind Neverwinter Nights has kept the game alive and active all this time \u2014 and it has been given a new, unofficial update \u201cby unpaid software engineers from the NWN community.\u201d This patch includes several quality of life improvements, graphical fixes, and performance boosts to keep the game running smoothly on modern hardware. For reference, roughly a year after Neverwinter Nights is when BioWare released the cult-classic Knights of the Old Republic. BioWare was at the height of its prowess with regard to storytelling and gameplay.\n\nDespite the game\u2019s age, it still has a long-standing community of fans and creators that give Neverwinter Nights nearly unlimited replayability. In addition to The Wailing Death campaign that comes with the original release of the game, Neverwinter Nights also has two other campaigns: Horde of the Underdark and Shadows of the Undrentide. If none of those tickle your fancy, then the fan-made campaigns might be the place to look. Think about it like a homebrew DnD campaign, except that it\u2019s all programmed for you to play through at your leisure. There are dozens of fan-made campaigns to choose from, many of which are on-par with original Wizards of the Coast content in terms of quality.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAs for what the \u201cmajor performance improvements\u201d listed in the update notes actually are, it isn\u2019t clear. There are several persistent, ongoing fan servers running multiplayer modules that continue to grow and change, even if players aren\u2019t actively involved at the time. The original game was not designed for multi-core processors, so there has always been a risk of bottlenecking during more demanding segments. If this patch allows Neverwinter Nights to make the most of modern hardware, then the modding scene could explode even further.\n\nNeverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Coming Soon\n\nNeverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition was released on Steam in 2018 by Beamdog, and now that same studio has given its blessing to this latest patch. The Enhanced Edition brought several graphical improvements and compatibility for more modern hardware, but don\u2019t worry; you don\u2019t need a new version to experience the game. The original version of Neverwinter Nights is still a great experience, but be warned: it\u2019s a lot more difficult than you might expect."

            "article_content": "Tomorrow\u2019s workplace will see the proliferation of automation, robots, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Data will go from big to colossal, and video-enabled collaboration will push teams further, faster. Exponential technological growth is changing work as we know it forever; yet key values endure.\n\nAI\u2019s transformative technology will solve complex problems and enhance human capabilities across industries, yet it must be responsibly developed. AI is not only a technology challenge, it\u2019s a leadership opportunity. This is what business schools must focus on every day: How can we best prepare students for responsible leadership? How can we prepare them to lead others into the unknown and to create value and positive change in a world of new driving forces, including AI?\n\nActive learning\n\nThe best preparation for future action is active learning. The Socratic method, complemented by the case study method, builds leadership capacity at a higher and faster rate than other methods of learning. In 2000 BCE, Socrates strolled through Athens\u2019 agora (marketplace) and shared his belief that true wisdom comes not from having all of the answers but in knowing how to ask the right questions. Questions peel away layers of assumption, encourage dialogue, make room for curiosity and innovation and require a strong dose of humility. This timeless posture of learning through questions \u2014 the Socratic Method \u2014 strengthens the muscle of critical thinking and develops the skills of collaboration and communication.\n\nThere are few business schools in the world that use the Socratic method and even fewer that underpin it with the case study method. Here\u2019s how it works: Faculty do not deliver lectures while students take notes. Instead, learners engage in active and experiential learning.\n\nIn the case study method, MBA students examine hundreds of real-life business case studies, replete with challenges and twists. They review these cases with their teams and come to class prepared to express their own formulated ideas and arguments and to apply their knowledge. Ethics, innovation and sustainability are themes woven across the curriculum. Up to 50% of a student\u2019s grade comes from participating in classroom conversation. The faculty orchestrate this symphony of ideas, opinion, debate and feedback, ensuring that the students learn not just from the professor but from each other.\n\nBuild leadership\n\nStudents also evaluate their purpose and articulate their values. They join learning teams and take on leadership positions in student organisations. Student self-governance means that students aren\u2019t just passengers; they are co-pilots. This interactive learning model teaches learners to solve problems with imperfect information, and to speak persuasively and confidently. Putting the learner in the role of the general manager builds leadership capacity and prepares them for the work they will be hired to do: to make recommendations for action.\n\nThe writer is Dean of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business."

            "article_content": "The scorched-earth approach Israel has taken in Palestinian areas such as the Bureij camp in Gaza, as well as in southern Lebanon, may well inspire future generations of fighters.\n\nSince the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has been at war in the Middle East. The conflict has stretched across borders, spanning Gaza to Lebanon to Iran. Over the course of 15 months, the Israel Defense Forces and Israel\u2019s intelligence services have taken the fight directly to Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, two of the most prominent members of Iran\u2019s \u201cAxis of Resistance.\u201d\n\nA dramatic Israeli intelligence operation in mid-September involved exploding pagers and walkie-talkies , resulting in the death of more than a dozen Hezbollah foot soldiers, with thousands of other people in Lebanon injured or maimed. In Gaza, the Israeli military has killed more than 17,000 Hamas fighters, a devastating blow to the group\u2019s rank and file, affecting 22 of Hamas\u2019 24 battalions.\n\nBut the centerpiece of Israel\u2019s efforts has been targeted assassinations , killing the leaders of these groups with ruthless efficiency. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was taken out by an Israeli airstrike in late September, while Hamas\u2019 leader, Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Oct. 7 attack, was killed by the Israeli military in Rafah in mid-October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the conventional wisdom on counterterrorism, however, suggests that killing a terrorist leader \u2014 also known as decapitation strikes \u2014 is insufficient to defeat these groups over the long term.\n\nDespite that, there have been numerous scholars and analysts who have published assessments suggesting that, as the Economist opined , there is \u201cgood reason to believe that this time may be different.\u201d Respected military historian Raphael S. Cohen added his voice to those who see Sinwar\u2019s death as highly consequential, arguing that \u201cthis incident differs from killing al-Zarqawi, al-Baghdadi, and even bin Ladin,\u201d in reference to the leaders of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the Islamic State and core Al Qaeda, respectively.\n\nStill, the empirical evidence and the broader body of research on the efficacy of decapitation strikes point to both Hamas and Hezbollah continuing to function, even in a significantly attenuated state, until both can recruit new members and rebuild their organizations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the reasons it is premature to write the obituary of either Hamas or Hezbollah is that both groups are better understood as insurgent organizations, not transnational terrorist groups. What\u2019s the difference? Terrorism is a tactic, while insurgency is a strategy. Terrorism consists of \u201cviolent, criminal attacks,\u201d and although insurgents might use terrorism, it does not define them; an insurgency is \u201cthe organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify, or challenge political control of a region.\u201d Hamas and Hezbollah have nationalist agendas interwoven with Islamist ideology, but the group\u2019s primary members and supporters are Palestinians and Lebanese, respectively.\n\nThese groups are organic and homegrown, unlike the Islamic State or Al Qaeda, which have relied heavily on fighters from abroad. This matters because foreign fighters, while zealous in many ways, are unmoored from the territory they inhabit. For most of its existence, Al Qaeda was a roving band of jihadists that traveled from battlefield to battlefield, stretching from the Balkans to the Caucasus to South Asia. At its peak , the Islamic State counted 30,000 foreign fighters from 85 countries, not including those who brought along their families.\n\nBy contrast, Hamas and Hezbollah will replenish their ranks with locals \u2014 new recruits, many of whom will be catalyzed to continue their struggle after the immense devastation and humanitarian suffering wrought by Israel\u2019s draconian approach in Gaza and Lebanon. As they have throughout their tenure, Hamas and Hezbollah will use the ongoing conflict to reinforce a cult of martyrdom in an effort to ensure that ideological and religious fervor is transmitted to younger generations. Killing leaders of the organizations does not significantly hinder this \u2014 and might even fuel radicalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are part and parcel of the sociopolitical fabric in Gaza and Lebanon and will inevitably regrow their depleted ranks. Hezbollah recruits through offering jobs, education and healthcare and by providing other services to Shia in southern Lebanon. Israel\u2019s scorched-earth approach in Gaza \u2014 where 45,000 Palestinians have been killed and the territory\u2019s infrastructure razed to the ground \u2014 will serve as a recruiting tool for Hamas as it seeks to enlist the next wave of Palestinians, many of whom will be radicalized by the war and its aftermath. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fighting their sons in four or five years,\u201d remarked Yaakov Peri , the former head of the Israeli intelligence agency Shin Bet, in reference to the cycle of violence perpetuated by Israel\u2019s ongoing assault in Gaza.\n\nTo be sure, the onslaught has been devastating to both groups. And yet, neither organization is likely to fade away. As Mideast expert Steven Cook noted after Sinwar\u2019s death : \u201cIt is hard to kill your way out of the problem posed by a resistance movement. The committed do not get the message; they just redouble their efforts.\u201d\n\nIn Israel, there is a famous saying about counterterrorism, which Israelis euphemistically dub \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d The analogy is apt because the grass always grows back. But in this latest round of fighting, over the past 15 months, Israel decided to do more than \u201cmow the grass\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing scorched earth instead.\n\nRather than an issue to be mitigated, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his inner circle of far-right ministers have tried to convince Israelis that the challenges of Hamas and Hezbollah could be solved once and for all. In November, speaking of Hezbollah, the prime minister said : \u201cThis is no longer the same Hezbollah. \u2026 We set it back decades.\u201d As for Hamas, Netanyahu said the Israelis will remain in Gaza until the group is \u201ccompletely destroyed.\u201d Kim Ghattas, a journalist and regional expert, has described these objectives as \u201cmaximalist and largely unattainable.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Israeli military\u2019s pursuit of \u201ctotal victory\u201d in Gaza and Lebanon is what will guarantee the survival of Hamas and Hezbollah. After all, insurgent organizations need to be combated through counterinsurgency, not counterterrorism. The Israelis have pursued a solution entirely mismatched to the problem. Counterinsurgency involves \u201ccomprehensive civilian and military efforts designed to simultaneously defeat and contain insurgency and address its root causes.\u201d\n\nBut Israel\u2019s recent approach in Gaza and Lebanon contained no real plan to protect the population and no effort to \u201cwin hearts and minds.\u201d Moreover, from the very beginning of these overlapping conflicts, Netanyahu has never attempted to offer a coherent political endgame for dealing with either Hamas or Hezbollah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs always, war, and especially insurgency, is politics through other means. Israel\u2019s military campaign, while impressive tactically, has relied solely on the kinetic aspects of conflict, entirely neglecting the political component, and condemning future generations on all sides to the same fate \u2014 perpetual war.\n\nColin P.

            "article_content": "Warning: this article contains images some readers might find distressing.\n\nUK scientists have made a major breakthrough while investigating inflammatory bowel disease, which could change the lives of thousands.\n\nBecause of this finding, it is no longer 'not clear' what causes the condition, according to scientists and we could very well be on the way to finding a suitable treatment plan that helps so many people get rid of their painful symptoms.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe breakthrough could change the lives of those who suffer from IBD, as effective treatments might have been right in front of us all along without anyone even knowing.\n\nThe answer to the IBD question was revealed after the researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and University College London found that there is a weak spot in the DNA of people who suffer from IBD, while they were trying to figure out where the condition originates from.\n\nThe researchers made a breakthrough (SEBASTIAN KAULITZKI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty)\n\nThey revealed that this DNA glitch was present in 95 percent of people who have the disease, and now they reckon they have finally gotten to the bottom of what causes the illness to occur.\n\nAdvert\n\nThis horrid condition causes people to feel uncomfortable, bloated, pain in their abdomen and it can also make them vomit too if they eat certain foods.\n\nSo, finding a proper treatment would save so many people from having to live with debilitating symptoms.\n\nDr James Lee, the group leader of the genetic mechanisms of disease laboratory at Francis Crick, explained that his team 'stumbled' on the groundbreaking discovery after taking a closer look at a 'gene desert'.\n\nThis is scientific jargon for a stretch of DNA on chromosome 21, which does not code for proteins and has previously been linked to health problems, such as IBD and other autoimmune diseases.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe research, which was detailed in Nature, said that scientists realised a particular section of DNA - dubbed an 'enhancer' - acts similarly to a volume control for nearby genes.\n\nBut this booster was only seen in immune cells, or white blood cells, known as macrophages - where it amplified a gene called ETS2 and dually raised the risk of IBD.\n\nMacrophages flood the linings of the intestines and release chemicals called cytokines, which trigger massive inflammation - and as we all know, too much of this for prolonged periods is uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nResearchers found that the 'enhancer' section of DNA is the macrophage's 'master regulator' of inflammation after conducting thorough genetic analysis, which Dr Lee said sits 'at the top of the pyramid'.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey found that there is a DNA weakness (NEMES LASZLO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty)\n\nDr Lee added: \"This is undoubtedly one of the central pathways that goes wrong for people to get inflammatory bowel disease. It is the process by which one of the most important cells that causes inflammatory bowel disease goes wrong.\"\n\nDubbing it a 'holy grail' discovery, he explained that drugs which are already approved for other illnesses such as cancer were able to calm this excessive inflammation - but they need to be tweaked to perfection to target the macrophages.\n\nDr Lee said he hopes that clinical trials will be underway within five years.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey are now keen to set up human trials after realising drugs which already exist seem to reverse the disease in laboratory experiments - so it's looking up for those with IBD.\n\nIf you didn't know, around half a million people in the UK are suffering from some form of inflammatory bowel disease, but Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both the most common.\n\nSufferers typically experience symptoms such as diarrhoea, stomach pain or cramps, blood in their poo, bleeding from their bottom, fatigue and excessive weight loss without trying.\n\nThere's obviously a big overlap between the signs of IBD and other similar conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but you can differentiate between the two as IBD causes inflammation in the bowels.\n\nAccording to the NHS website at the time of writing, it is 'not clear' what causes the disease, but it 'happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed'.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to update the website as now it\u2019s very much clear."

            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s a strange story: One day two summers ago, I woke up because my arms \u2014 both of them \u2014 hurt. Not the way they do when you\u2019ve slept in a funny position, but as if the tendons in my forearms and hands were moving through mud. What felt like sharp electric shocks kept sparking in my fingers and sometimes up the inside of my biceps and across my chest. Holding anything was excruciating: a cup, a toothbrush, my phone. Even doing nothing was miserable. It hurt when I sat with my hands in my lap, when I stood, when I lay flat on the bed or on my side. The slightest pressure \u2014 a bedsheet, a watch band, a bra strap \u2014 was intolerable.\n\nIt was August, and every doctor seemed to be away on vacation. The ones I did manage to see were politely stumped. It wasn\u2019t carpal tunnel, tennis elbow or any other injury they could identify. I did nothing unusual the day before: an hour of work on my laptop, followed by a visit with a friend. We sat in her backyard and talked.\n\nFor the first few weeks, I could barely sleep. Over the following months, I lost weight \u2014 almost a pound a week. I couldn\u2019t drive, or cook, or use my laptop for work, or even hold a book or a pen. I would have been bored, except the pain was so tiring that I could barely function. I spent the days shuffling around the house listening to audiobooks and doing voice-to-text searches for \u201cnerve pain arms\u201d with my phone flat on the table, then carefully, painfully, scrolling through the results.\n\nI think we\u2019re past the point where I have to explain that chronic pain is not the result of imbalanced humors or a wandering uterus or possession by demons. But for more modern skeptics, this is where I should add that chronic pain also isn\u2019t just \u201call in your head\u201d or \u201cnot really that bad\u201d \u2014 or any of the other ways in which people who suffer from it are still regularly gaslit and dismissed."

            "article_content": "The elixir of life: When AI meets genomics\n\nDr. Khaled Walid Mahmoud\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) and genetic engineering represents an unprecedented turning point in human history. By merging digital capabilities with biology, these fields are unlocking the secrets of life and reshaping it in profound ways. Among the leaders in this transformative era is the biotech company Shift Bioscience, which recently secured $16 million in seed funding to support its groundbreaking research on reversing aging. Utilizing generative AI, the company simulates human cells to identify genes capable of rejuvenation, paving the way for treatments aimed at slowing or even reversing the effects of aging.\n\nHowever, this scientific leap forward is intertwined with deeper complexities concerning humanity\u2019s understanding of existence and the boundaries of scientific intervention. Genomics, one of the most intricate sciences, deciphers the DNA code that holds information about our biological history, present, and future. Dubbed the \u201celixir of life,\u201d genomics enables humans to correct genetic mutations that impact health. Yet, it also raises thorny ethical questions about the limits of genetic modification and its implications for human nature itself.\n\nAI excels in tackling the challenges inherent in this complexity. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, precise genetic modifications can now correct hereditary errors responsible for various diseases. Advanced technologies such as DeepCRISPR and CRISPR-Net enhance the accuracy of these modifications and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. AI not only identifies target genes but also designs guide RNA sequences to ensure precise execution of genetic edits. These extraordinary capabilities are redefining our relationship with our bodies, making it possible to predict future diseases, prevent them, and even improve genetic traits before future generations are born.\n\nDespite these advancements, the scientific revolution is not without its challenges and risks. While scientists pursue the dream of biological immortality, privacy concerns emerge as one of the most significant threats. Genetic data analysis, also known as genetic fingerprinting, reveals the biological secrets of individuals, which could potentially be exploited to develop biological weapons or invade personal privacy. Without robust legal and ethical frameworks, these technologies become a double-edged sword\u2014either enhancing human well-being or exposing humanity to exploitation.\n\nBeyond ethical risks, humanity faces new challenges related to increasing reliance on technology. A notable example is the impact of modern devices like GPS systems on the human brain. Studies show that drivers who rely on these systems experience shrinkage in brain regions responsible for navigation, while those who rely on natural skills maintain the health of these areas. This \u201ctechnological colonization,\u201d which threatens to undermine human capabilities, raises questions about the price we pay for technological progress.\n\nThe ongoing scientific revolution is not merely about technical achievements; it is a test of our ethical and human values. Genetic modification and anti-aging technologies may bring biological immortality closer to reality, but the larger question remains: How do we balance scientific ambition with the preservation of human essence? While AI delves into the \u201cbiological library\u201d within our bodies, humanity bears the responsibility of ensuring these innovations serve, rather than dominate, us.\n\nThis complex question gains urgency as scientific progress accelerates, tempting some to prioritize profit or power over ethics. It is crucial to establish regulatory frameworks to govern the use of genetic data and protect it from misuse. Yet, regulations alone are insufficient; societies need a collective awareness of the importance of balancing technological progress with respect for human values.\n\nAs AI and genetic engineering open unprecedented doors to enhancing and prolonging life, the greatest challenge remains ensuring that these innovations reflect our shared aspiration for a more humane and secure future. Technology, with all its potential, is merely a tool; its true value lies in how it is used to serve humanity.\n\nGenomics stands as humanity\u2019s most ambitious and transformative scientific pursuit\u2014a profound journey to decipher the very code of life and reshape its narrative. In unraveling the mysteries of DNA, we are not merely advancing the boundaries of biology; we are fundamentally redefining what it means to be human. This monumental endeavor holds the promise of becoming the ultimate \u201celixir of life,\u201d capable of curing diseases, extending longevity, and enhancing our existence. Yet, it also carries the weight of profound ethical and societal challenges. The true legacy of genomics will be determined by our capacity to wield its power with wisdom, foresight, and responsibility.\n\nThe writer is a researcher specializing in cyber politics, holding a PhD on the topic of \u201cCyberspace and Power Shifts in International Relations.\u201d"
