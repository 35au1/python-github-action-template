            "article_content": "(Stacker) - When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Wisconsin using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "The recent congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly known as UFOs, has ignited a call for transparency from lawmakers across the political spectrum.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chairwoman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Nancy Mace, said:\n\n\u201cI obviously would like to know how much taxpayers are spending on this. You have the right to know. And if we are spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money? And if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public? Of course, national security is a big issue and if there is technology that could harm us or our allies that are in the hands of our adversaries, we obviously want to stay ahead of that to the best of our abilities.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense, which oversees UAP research, is set to receive a proposed budget of $850 billion in 2025. However, the exact amount spent on UAP research remains unclear, contributing to congressional frustration over the perceived secrecy surrounding the issue. The Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022, is tasked with investigating these phenomena.\n\nA group of bipartisan lawmakers in Congress introduced the UAP Transparency Act, which would require the declassification of all federal documents related to UAPs. The bill mandates that the president instruct federal agencies to release UAP research documents to the public within 270 days and provide Congress with quarterly progress reports. The UAP Transparency Act was referred to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in May, but no further action has been taken.\n\nAARO reviewed 757 new UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024, identifying 21 cases that \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to their \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d Despite these findings, AARO\u2019s report stated there is no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial life is responsible for these sightings.\n\n\u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the intelligence community, do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of AARO.\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Emma Withrow at ewithrow@sbgtv.com or at x.com/emma_withrow.

One expert explained that the lights were only a phenomenon that shows nothing but a reflection in the night sky.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

The comprehensive planning approach has accommodated multiple thoughtful solutions for all of these needs, such as replacing the oldest roofs entirely, increasing insulation where needed, and resurfacing other roof areas to extend their lifespan and warranties for a fraction of the cost of full roof replacement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project would include expansion of the main gymnasium to create a gymnatorium. This includes expansion and renovation of the existing high school gymnasium to accommodate a full-sized basketball court. The renovation will also include a flexible theatrical stage, maintaining the functionality of a traditional auditorium, complete with updated stage lighting and sound.\n\nThe cost of the project is estimated at $21,000,000 with no additional tax increase to taxpayers."

Alongside Sinistea and Polteageist\u2019s arrival, you can encounter a range of themed Pok\u00e9mon in the wild and during raids throughout the event.\n\nTwo of the best gen 8 Pok\u00e9mon are finally joining Pok\u00e9mon Go in the Just My Cup of Tea event \u2013 the spooky Sinistea and paranormal Polteageist. Of course, in a region themed around the British Isles, The Pok\u00e9mon Company had to introduce a tea-themed \u2018mon for us to collect, and we all fell in love with it. Unlike in the Switch game, you don\u2019t have to worry about whether your Sinistea is genuine or not, as you can evolve any teacup you find into a haunted teapot with just 50 Sinistea candies.\n\nWhile you\u2019re out hunting for Sinistea in the wild, you\u2019ll also be more likely to find a range of themed Pok\u00e9mon on your travels, like Oddish, Duskull, and Gothita, so make sure you stock up on Pok\u00e9balls before heading out. You\u2019ll also get 50% more stardust and double the friendship bonus damage in raids during the event, so take the opportunity to challenge Genesect (Chill Drive) in five-star raids and Mega Banette in mega raids. You could even catch a shiny one!\n\nWhen is the Pok\u00e9mon Go Just My Cup of Tea event?\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s Just My Cup of Tea event runs from 10am local time on Tuesday, December 3, to 8pm local time on Saturday, December 7, 2024. Make sure to take part in field research, timed research, collection challenges, and Pok\u00e9Stop showcases during this event to claim the many rewards on offer.\n\nThat\u2019s everything you need to know about the Pok\u00e9mon Go Just My Cup of Tea event.

            "article_content": "Every Friday night in the early months of 1994, Channel 4 took British viewers on a trip into The Unpleasant World of Penn & Teller. Each week, the American duo \u2013 Teller, the mononymous mag\u00ad\u00adi\u00adcian, and Penn Jillette, with his ironic patter and pony-tail \u2013 would fill the screen with their irreverent take on the traditional stage \u00admagic show, including a notoriously blood-spattered skit in which Teller was power-sawed in half. They are a little older now (Penn is 69, Teller, 76), but here we are, a stone\u2019s throw from the Houses of Parliament, talking about the 50th anniversary of their partnership, which they\u2019ll celebrate next year with 11 nights at the London Palladium.\n\nFor many years, both men have lived and worked in Las Vegas, where they have the longest-\u00adrunning residency in the casino city. So far, they\u2019ve shown no desire to join the celebrities planning to quit the US when Donald Trump takes power, although Penn claims to have been on Trump\u2019s \u201chate list\u201d for more than a decade, after describing the future president as a \u201cwhack job\u201d with \u201ccotton candy p--s hair\u201d, in 2012, when he appeared alongside him on The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n\u201cI know Trump,\u201d Penn tells me. \u201cI know him very well. And I have a great deal of tolerance for people who are off the bell curve: I have very close friends who are neuro\u00addiverse in some pretty intense ways. When I worked on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump Jr said to me, \u2018You seem like the only person who actually likes my father.\u2019 And I want to cop to that. But what Trump cannot understand is how I could be comfortable with him working at a TV show, and not comfortable with him as president of the United States.\u201d Trump, he continues, \u201cis bordering on stupid\u201d.\n\nAnd yet Penn\u2019s compatriots have voted overwhelmingly to put him back in the White House. \u201cIt was [Apprentice network] NBC that did it, and also it was the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have people who are brimming with hate and you tell them that that\u2019s OK, I think it really explodes.\u201d His anxiety about \u201ctrolls and robots\u201d runs deep, but he notes, wryly, that \u201cthe internet, although it may have destroyed America and will be destroying the world, I think, is nothing but good for magic\u201d. It has, he suggests, taken what was an off-puttingly closed world and democratised it.\n\nPenn & Teller have been criticised for revealing the closely guarded secrets of the trade, by, for instance, performing the \u201ccups and balls\u201d trick with clear plastic cups. They\u2019ve been refused membership of the Magic Circle, the famous society of magicians, because of such routines. \u201cThe whole idea of keeping secrets is so offensive,\u201d Penn says. \u201cI love the fact that you can go on the internet and find out how a magic trick is done; pretending that all we have is secrets is an insult. It\u2019s like, if I were to come to you and say, \u2018Here\u2019s the words of the Dylan song, here\u2019s the sheet music, here\u2019s the tuning of his guitar, that\u2019s all you need.\u2019 Well, no, it\u2019s not.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Calendars across the Northern Hemisphere say winter will begin on Dec. 21, but for meteorologists, the start of the season happens three weeks earlier on Dec. 1.\n\nThe reason behind the discrepancy is that weather experts follow what\u2019s called meteorological seasons, while others use the astronomical calendar to signify the change.\n\nMeteorologists and climatologists break down the seasons based on when temperatures typically change, not the status of Earth \u2019s rotation.\n\nThe start of winter depends on whether you're referring to the astronomical or the meteorological start. (FOX Weather)\n\nUnder the meteorological season scheme, the four seasons are each allotted three months, making it easier to calculate statistics and compare weather conditions to previous years.\n\nThe rotation of Earth around the Sun and the planet\u2019s tilt make the basis for the astronomical calendar.\n\nWEAK LA NI\u00d1A EXPECTED TO EMERGE SOON AND LAST INTO SPRING\n\nThe Earth's orbit around the sun gives our planet its four seasons. (NOAA)\n\nThe astronomical changing of the seasons is marked by either a solstice or an equinox.\n\nThe summer and winter solstices occur when the Northern Hemisphere is at its maximum tilt toward or away from the Sun, respectively.\n\nWhen Earth\u2019s axis isn\u2019t tilted in favor of either direction, it\u2019s referred to as an equinox, or the start of spring or fall .\n\nWINTER OUTLOOK: LA NI\u00d1A SET TO EMERGE, UNLEASHING LARGE SWING POTENTIAL FOR MORE SNOW, FRIGID TEMPERATURES\n\nThe days that the solstices and equinoxes fall on vary year-by-year because Earth takes slightly more than 365 days to revolve around the Sun, hence why you\u2019ll see slight adjustments in the changing of the astronomical seasons.\n\nNOAA says meteorological seasons were developed because of the ever-changing dates produced by the astronomical calendar.\n\nSo when the calendar switches over to December, don\u2019t be shocked if your favorite FOX Weather meteorologist is welcoming everyone to winter.\n\nFARMERS ALMANACS ISSUE DUELING WINTER OUTLOOKS: \u2018GENTLER\u2019 OR \u2018WHIRLWIND\u2019?\n\nMeteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and runs through Feb. 28, which tends to be a better fit for the coldest time of the year than astronomical winter.\n\nRead more from FOX Weather"

Once you\u2019ve committed to that, it\u2019s important to figure out if you want to purchase a lifetime/one time only deal or if you\u2019re fine paying each year. There are pros and cons here as the yearly subscriptions tend to give you more updates and new features, but you\u2019ll be paying for it.\n\nAlongside that, you need to think about how many people you need a license for. Are you just buying for yourself or do you need to support the whole family? You need a license for each person using Microsoft Office at any one time, so make sure you buy something that works for everyone. Also, think about extras like how much cloud storage is bundled in. For the most part though, it\u2019s a pretty simple process buying Microsoft Office.\n\nHow we chose these Microsoft Office products on Cyber Monday\n\nWe know our way around deals, as well as what\u2019s important with Microsoft Office.

In conjunction, we know all about Microsoft Office along with the pros and cons of buying a subscription to 365 or going for a onetime purchase. We can recommend different services for different people with plenty of knowledge backing that view up. Essentially, all the deals above are the kind of deals that we would recommend to our friends and family, and that we would use ourselves. There\u2019s no filler here or any substandard packages. We only include genuinely good products here, which luckily tends to encompass most of what Microsoft Office provides as standard. We also check back regularly and update the deals with the latest best prices."
