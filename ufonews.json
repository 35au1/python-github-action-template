Announced on November 25, Teleport by Varjo is a mobile app that uses AI to construct high-resolution 3D scans without specialized equipment. The company claims the app is the first to allow the VR scanning with just a smartphone.\n\nThe Teleport app uses generative AI built with NVIDIA GPUs to create virtual reality content from a smartphone. In an interview with Digital Camera World, the company explained that the app uses AI to create a representation from a series of images. The app doesn\u2019t require LiDAR, but iPhones with the technology can use it for enhanced results, Varjo noted.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app walks users through scanning a location, creating 3D scenes that can then be viewed on a computer, smartphone, or with a virtual reality headset. At launch, the app is available for iPhone and iPad and requires iOS 17 or later.\n\nUnlike Apple\u2019s spatial video, the Teleport photos shared by Varjo allow viewers to move within the space, looking between objects and taking in the room from different viewing angles. Spatial video, on the other hand, captures some depth but leaves the viewer \u201cstanding\u201d in the same spot.\n\nAccording to Varjo, scanning a scene in 3D took around five to ten minutes in beta testing. The company says that 2,000 professionals helped test the beta version of the Teleport app, creating a library of online Teleport scans. The app both reduces the time and complexity involved with full 3D captures, Varjo says, with commercial uses like construction, inspection or training as well as personal applications like saving a view of your wedding venue to relive in VR later.\n\nThe scans also allow for measuring the space from the 3D scans, including a rescaling tool for more accurate measurements. The company notes the measuring option isn\u2019t designed for high-precision engineering, but can prove helpful for applications like design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the app aims to create a lower entry into the field of VR and 3D scans, the Teleport app requires a subscription that starts at $30 / \u20ac24 / AU$ 46. Still, the cost is significantly lower than the price of pro-grade 3D VR cameras, or the cost of Canon\u2019s unique dual optics for the R mount. The app, however, is designed for scanning places, where VR cameras can also capture 3D video.\n\nWhile pro-grade VR 3D equipment isn\u2019t new, the growth of the technology has arguably been slow, as the VR headsets that deliver the most full experience are far from as widespread as smartphones and laptops. The high cost of the cameras required for such scans also likely played a role, which means a lower entry point like the Telephoto app could potentially spark some growth.\n\nNot a fan of AI?

            "article_content": "Flickers of light dance within the fireplace of the Sparkford Inn\u2019s dining room, the warmth overshadowed by rumors of ghosts lingering in the shadows. A team of paranormal investigators arrive one misty March evening to search for a giggling boy whom many guests have reportedly seen darting around the bar, across the dining room, and playing in the pool room. Witnesses have described him as about seven years old, dressed in scorched rags, and bearing burn marks\u2014features that suggest he is no ordinary child. He is, they claim, a ghost.\n\nCaroline McKendrick, lead investigator at Somerset Paranormal Investigators UK (SPI UK), a group that has been probing paranormal phenomena since 2012, says that reports of the boy often coincide with unexplained events. \u201cSeveral objects were mysteriously knocked off the kitchen counter, and the dishwasher switched on by itself, even when no one was nearby,\u201d McKendrick says. For years, staff and guests alike have reported strange occurrences: whispers in empty rooms, objects moving on their own, and other ghostly figures, including a domineering man and a woman who frequents Room No. 6.\n\nThese accounts, along with a local urban legend about the Inn\u2019s haunted past, convinced the six members of SPI UK to investigate. Tucked away in the small village of Somerset in southwest England, the Sparkford Inn dates back to the late Middle Ages. Over the centuries, it has served as a stopover for horse-drawn coaches, a popular lodging place for visitors, and a meeting point for local hunters. Today, it\u2019s a cozy hotel and pub. McKendrick and company arrived here with the goal of not only cataloging these apparitions, but proving they\u2019re full-bodied spirits, which are interactive entities that can produce physical effects and respond to human contact.\n\nFor the investigators, the stakes are high. The popularity of shows like Ghost Hunters and Paranormal Witness have fueled a fascination with the supernatural. But for SPI UK, it\u2019s more than a trend, it\u2019s a pursuit for real answers. Tracking down the elusive ghosts at the Sparkford Inn will put their skills and equipment to the test. Capturing tangible evidence of the paranormal would be a major breakthrough, advancing ghost hunting as a legitimate field of study\u2014far beyond mere entertainment or pseudoscience.\n\nFollowing McKendrick through the Inn\u2019s dimly lit corridors, the investigators are carrying large cases of technical equipment. Their toolkit includes electromagnetic field meters (EFMs) and thermal imaging cameras. While none of the team members are formally trained scientists, they bring many years of hands-on experience to their investigations, approaching cases with what they consider to be scientific rigor. Paranormal investigations, they say, follow a structured process that includes on-site visits, interviews with witnesses, and data collection. Afterward, the team analyzes the data for patterns and anomalies, like reviewing audio recordings for electronic voice phenomena.\n\nAlamy\n\nTo investigate the boy spirit, the team relies on their tried-and-tested methods, tuning their approach to encourage communication. They\u2019ve brought a teddy bear, play balls, and a toy clock to lure the young boy ghost into contact.\n\n\u201cYou communicate with the child\u2019s spirit the way you would with living children,\u201d says Donna Lalla, a paranormal investigator on the SPI UK team. Lalla is cordial and soft-spoken with short silver-gray hair and glasses. She tries to bring a nurturing energy to the team, especially for investigations involving children. \u201cYou encourage play, you start a nursery rhyme. You start singing \u201cRing-Around-the Rosie\u201d and wait for the young ghost to pick up the rhyme,\u201d Lalla continues. She begins to hum the tune, hoping the young ghost joins in.\n\nEveryone waits.\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\nDespite their best efforts, the team has yet to find convincing proof of a ghost. They partly blame their equipment, which is powerful, but not exactly designed for paranormal investigations. Electromagnetic Field detectors (EMFs), for example, detect electrical-wiring issues in the workplace or at home, and thermal-imaging cameras identify heat signatures in construction and firefighting. Still, the investigators persist, optimizing the tools they have, hungry for a breakthrough.\n\nThe idea of a realm between life and death\u2014where spirits linger and interact with the living\u2014has fascinated humankind across cultures and centuries. This belief in ghosts, spirits, and the supernatural has deep roots in ancient cultures, with references found in Egyptian tomb texts, Greek epics like The Odyssey, and early Chinese ghost stories.\n\nIn 1882, paranormal investigations took on more scientific undertones when a group of scholars and intellectuals, from physicists to journalists, founded The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London, the first organization dedicated to the scientific study of paranormal and supernatural phenomena. The SPR aimed to apply scientific methods and principles to the study of paranormal and supernatural phenomena, covering telepathy, mediumship, and apparitions.\n\nThen the American Society for Psychical Research emerged in 1884 when physicist Sir William Barrett persuaded authoritative scientific figures and intellectuals\u2014such as the Scottish-born American inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, and William James, the father of American psychology\u2014that it was vital to apply the scientific method to psychical phenomena. James himself dove headfirst into investigating mediums, attending s\u00e9ances. His aim was twofold and conflicting by today\u2019s standards: to understand the depths of human consciousness and to explore the possibility that consciousness might transcend the physical body, potentially explaining life after death itself.\n\nAs these groups evolved, so did the tools they employed. Early ghost hunters relied primarily on observational methods and interviews . They would conduct s\u00e9ances, monitor mediums, and document irregular phenomena in detail\u2014for example table movements or unexplained sounds during s\u00e9ances. As technology advanced, investigators began incorporating new instruments and adapting them to suit their needs.\n\n\u201cSpirits need tremendous amounts of energy to penetrate the sphere of the living,\u201d explains Lalla, adjusting an EMF meter as the team prepares for the night\u2019s investigation. Today, at the Sparkford Inn, the SPI UK team brings a range of these tools into the field. They hope their handheld EMF devices will detect spikes in electromagnetic energy, which they believe might signal the presence of spirits.\n\nStav Dimitropoulos\n\nA few moments later in the dimly lit corridor, Lalla scans the room with a thermal imaging camera, looking for heat signatures that might suggest an unaccounted presence. Nearby, another team member positions motion sensors near an antique rocking chair that, according to reports, has mysteriously moved in the past. The faint buzz of a Geiger counter fills the air, its needle steady but poised to detect any spikes in radiation\u2014a phenomenon some link to psychic activity.\n\nDigital voice recorders capture potential paranormal voices, while body cams ensure every moment is documented. One investigator monitors an environmental device, noting fluctuations in barometric pressure and humidity. \u201cIf a spirit manifests, it could subtly alter the immediate environment,\u201d she explains, pointing to the screen.\n\nBut these tools are only as effective as the investigators who wield them.\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\nThe feeble light from the hallway barely reaches the edges of Room No. 6 as the SPI UK team gathers around their equipment, their whispers blending with the creaks of the old floorboards. \u201cAsk her something specific,\u201d McKendrick says to Lalla, who is adjusting the settings on something called a spirit box. The device rapidly scans through radio frequencies, generating white noise that ghost hunters believe spirits can manipulate and communicate through. The spirit box crackles to life, its static filling the room as the investigators lean closer, straining to hear. Suddenly, a faint, almost imperceptible whisper cuts through the noise. The sound is fleeting, but it\u2019s enough to send a ripple of energy through the team.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d McKendrick asks, her voice a mixture of agony and elation. The team exchanges wide-eyed glances, the room suddenly electric with possibility.\n\nFor a moment, no one moves, ears straining for any follow-up. Lalla tilts her head toward the spirit box, her expression intent. \u201cWas that her?\u201d McKendrick finally murmurs. \u201cThe woman from Room No. 6?\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe team replays the recording, each straining to interpret the faint response. Could it have been a \u201cyes\u201d or a soft hum of agreement? The ambiguity only deepens the mystery.\n\nLater, McKendrick reflects on the moment with tempered excitement. \u201cWe caught a couple of incomprehensible voices in response to questions during callouts,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut they were more like uh huhs and mmms. If it had been clearer, I would have had the sound enhanced with an audio expert.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly did the team hear? Was it an eerie whisper from beyond or something more prosaic? The equipment ghostbusters rely on\u2014tools like spirit boxes and EMFs\u2014can pick up far more than just spirits. Static interference, stray radio signals, or even the voices of nearby people can all masquerade as spectral activity.\n\nSkeptics like Christopher French, a British psychologist and head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London, argue that such tools often mislead investigators. \u201cTo check whether allegedly paranormal phenomena are occurring, it\u2019s crucial to consider all possible explanations,\u201d French says. He suggests that whispers like those heard at the Sparkford Inn might simply be quiet noises from living people nearby, misinterpreted as ghostly communication, or random background noise amplified by eager imaginations.\n\nFrench also highlights a broader issue: the lack of rigorous data collection across time, which he argues is essential for true investigations of the unknown. Without such scientific scrutiny, the accuracy of instruments in paranormal use cases remain dubious.\n\n\u201cThese people want to give the appearance that they are doing science, but they really aren\u2019t,\u201d French says. \u201cTo check whether allegedly haunted locations have unusual patterns of electromagnetic activity, for example, you need to collect vast amounts of data in three dimensions across time. Without such scientific appraisal, the accuracy of instruments in paranormal use cases remains highly questionable. \u201cThose phantom outlines appearing on your thermal camera are usually specks of dust,\u201d French says.\n\nIn the case of the voice on the team\u2019s spirit box, French also has a theory. \u201cMost probably they inadvertently recorded living people speaking to each other that they didn't realize were in the area. Or sometimes even random background noises,\u201d he says.\n\nGetty Images\n\nLalla, however, disagrees. \u201cI just sit in a dark room, waiting,\u201d she says, estimating that up to two-thirds of her investigations produce no evidence at all. But her team never forces results. Take the scene with the toys, for instance. The teddy bear remained untouched. The toy clock never ticked, and no giggle or playful knock ever broke the silence. The lull of waiting is both part of the challenge and the mystery of their work. Lalla hums a nursery rhyme, but the room stays eerily still\u2014a subtle reminder that the paranormal often chooses its own time to speak, if at all.\n\nFrench acknowledges that while some teams are sincere in their mission, others may embellish evidence for sensational results. For many, French adds, the appeal lies in the social aspect and the status of being a paranormal investigator just as much as the search for real evidence. Still, the allure of the unexplained keeps investigators returning to allegedly spirit-infested places, where the line between ordinary and extraordinary occasionally blurs.\n\nAbout six months after their March investigation, McKendrick and her husband, who is also on the SPI UK team, visited the Sparkford Inn once again and met the new assistant manager. She shared a peculiar incident from early September that left her quite distressed. She was near the pool table when, suddenly, a pool ball came flying toward her through the hatch in the bar area. Startled, the manager approached the players at the pool table, jokingly admonishing them to keep their balls on the table. But all of their balls were accounted for; it was a spare. To add to the enigma, no one was near the bar area at the time who could have thrown it.\n\nOn another day, several staff and patrons witnessed a two-liter bottle of vodka fall from the wine rack and shatter on the ground. SPI UK investigators argue that the sheer number and variety of bizarre occurrences reported at the Inn make it difficult to simply dismiss them as coincidences or explain them away with skepticism. They vow to return again, armed with more high-tech tools and unflinching determination.\n\nIf there is a passage linking the living and the deceased, these apparition chasers believe they have the patience\u2014and the technology\u2014to uncover it. In their world, the world of the paranormal, every creak of time-worn wood, every shadow\u2019s fleeting waltz slipping past the awareness of the casual observer might be a potential scientific breakthrough and a gateway to a story untold."

            "article_content": "Dandadan is already a smash hit. The new anime adaptation of Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s wild manga dominated Netflix\u2019s streaming charts upon its release and has scored rave reviews from audiences and critics. Social media is overwhelmed by fans discussing the latest episodes, creating their own cosplay, or re-producing its now iconic opening credits. Dandadan is so wild and unpredictable that fans could easily binge 100 episodes and never get bored. But, unfortunately, we\u2019re already over halfway through Season 1!\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nAfter having his testicles stolen by the yokai Turbo Granny, Okarun enlists the help of his new friend Momo to fight paranormal and extra-terrestrial forces and regain his privates. We\u2019re all obsessed with Momo\u2019s mission, and the blossoming romance between the two leading characters. So why does Season 1 have to end so soon? Dandadan\u2019s first season will only run for a measly 12 episodes, as the show follows the most irritating trend in modern anime.\n\nStudio Pierrot\n\nAnime Used to Have 24-Episode (and Longer) Seasons\n\nHave you ever scrolled through a streaming service like Crunchyroll or Netflix and discovered a classic immensely popular anime, only to discover that each season is well over 50 episodes long? It\u2019s an overwhelming feeling every contemporary anime fan can relate to. If you\u2019re eager to go back and watch One Piece or Dragonball Z, prepare for a long commitment. Ignoring their total episode counts, each Season (or arc) of One Piece is roughly 60-episodes long, while Dragonball Z isn\u2019t even listed with seasons, as fans must chew their way through all 291 episodes without a natural breaking point.\n\nOlder shows had longer season runs for two key reasons. The first, and most controversial is the sheer number of filler and re-cap episodes. Of One Piece\u2018s 1122 episodes, 94 (8%) are considered to be pure filler by the fan base. Naruto is an even bigger culprit, as 90 of its 220 episodes are classed as filler \u2014 that\u2019s 40%!\n\nOlder anime also tend to be longer because they were originally made for children. In Japan, shows produced for a younger audience didn\u2019t have season breaks. This would explain Dragonball Z\u2018s overwhelmingly long 291-episode series.\n\nEven lesser-known shows like the sports anime Hajime no Ippo, or the criminally underappreciated Monster ran for over 70 episodes. Should every single new anime follow this trend and deliver an overabundance of new episodes? The die-hard viewers among us will say yes. Although it\u2019s an unrealistic expectation. After all, the animators have lives outside of work and families to get home to. But even 24-episode seasons are becoming less common.\n\nShows like Naruto, Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, the first season of Demon Slayer, and Assassination Classroom are all keeping the trend of 24+ episode seasons alive. After all, if we\u2019re waiting for over a year and half for a new season, it\u2019s incredibly disappointing when that wait is rewarded by just eight or ten episodes. So why have the episode counts of newer anime been drastically reduced?\n\nMAPPA\n\nWhy Modern Anime Has Fewer Episodes\n\nHell\u2019s Paradise (pictured above), Kaiju No. 8, the newer seasons of Demon Slayer, the aforementioned Dandadan, and Chainsaw Man are just a few new anime to have their seasonal episode counts slashed. Of course, there is no evil overlord selecting random anime to have fewer episodes. But there are a few reasons why new shows seem to be a lot shorter.\n\nFirstly, and most prominently, producing anime is expensive. In the end, all things in entertainment come down to cost, and quality anime is increasingly expensive to produce. An issue of Shukan Toyo Keizai (via SK Anime) reported that a single episode of anime costs anywhere between $140,000-180,000. As a result, a 12-episode season costs an average of $1.9 million. And that\u2019s just an estimate. As the quality of anime increases, audiences expectations increase, and the quality has to progress once more, which all results in further costs. Factor in Japan\u2019s economy and inflation, and anime is an increasingly costly medium.\n\nSecondly, studios favor short debut seasons to test the waters, and gauge audience interest in a new anime. The 2022 smash-hit, Chainsaw Man only ran for 12 episodes. However, after its tremendous success, a feature-length movie has officially been announced, and the franchise is expected to have a long future.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, most modern anime are adaptations of popular manga. Every show mentioned above is an adaptation. As a result, the shows are limited by how much overall story there is to adapt. In the case of Demon Slayer, its short new seasons result from adapting shorter arcs from the manga.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that Dandadan, and all the new shows listed above, get longer subsequent seasons in the future. As incredible as the shows are, 12-episode seasons don\u2019t satisfy the craving felt by a lot of fans for more episodes from the newest, most promising shows."

This guide walks you through essential aspects of launching your tech startup in Dubai, emphasizing the steps to navigate its promising ecosystem successfully.\n\nUnderstanding Dubai\u2019s Business Environment\n\nRapid growth, diverse industries, and substantial investment opportunities characterize Dubai\u2019s business environment. The UAE government offers numerous startup incentives, including tax exemptions and streamlined registration processes. Its policies foster innovation and make it easier for entrepreneurs to launch new businesses. Companies operating in free zones enjoy complete ownership and benefits such as relaxed regulations.\n\nAdditionally, industry-specific free zones enable startups to tap into niche markets, enhancing their competitive edge. Conducting thorough market research is crucial to understanding the local landscape. This knowledge allows you to identify gaps and opportunities in the market, guiding your business strategy. When setting up a business in Dubai, engaging with local business consultants significantly assists in navigating regulatory obligations and logistical challenges. Their expertise can streamline your entry into the market and provide insights into local consumer behavior. Overall, understanding the business environment in Dubai is foundational to establishing a successful startup.\n\nCreating a Solid Business Plan\n\nA well-structured business plan acts as a roadmap for your startup\u2019s growth. This document defines your business objectives, target market, financial forecasts, and marketing strategies. Begin by clearly outlining your product or service and what differentiates it from competitors. An effective business plan should also highlight your unique value proposition, effectively addressing customer pain points. Financial projections play a vital role in attracting investors and securing funding. Detail your anticipated expenses, revenue models, and break-even analysis to present a compelling case.\n\nComplying with Legal Requirements\n\nComplying with Dubai\u2019s legal requirements is a critical step toward a successful startup launch. Securing the necessary licenses and permits depends on your business type and the industry in which you operate. The Dubai Department of Economic Development (DED) plays a crucial role by issuing essential licenses to local and foreign enterprises. The types of permits include commercial, industrial, and professional categories, each requiring specific approvals. Alongside business registration, understanding local labor laws and regulations is vital for managing employees effectively. Dubai\u2019s employment laws govern contracts, wages, and worker rights, ensuring you adhere to the legal framework.\n\nBuilding a Network and Community\n\nEstablishing a solid professional network is essential for any startup. Dubai hosts various tech events, expos, and networking platforms, presenting numerous opportunities to connect with industry leaders and potential investors. Participating in these events allows you to showcase your startup, gain feedback, and forge valuable relationships. Collaborating with fellow entrepreneurs can lead to mentorship opportunities and even partnerships that strengthen your business. Moreover, exploring online platforms such as LinkedIn can expand your reach beyond physical events. Engaging with groups focused on technology and startups allows you to share ideas and trends while learning from peers. Overall, networking creates a robust ecosystem vital for startup success in Dubai.\n\nSecuring Funding for Your Startup\n\nFunding is often one of the most significant hurdles for entrepreneurs. Fortunately, Dubai\u2019s vibrant startup ecosystem features various funding sources, including angel investors, venture capital firms, and government grants. Exploring these avenues lets you find the proper financial support that aligns with your business vision. Local banks and financial institutions also offer loan programs tailored to startups, making it easier to access capital. Participating in business competitions and startup accelerators can provide funding, mentorship, and exposure. These platforms often offer seed funding in exchange for equity, allowing you to validate your business model under expert guidance. Proactively seeking funding sources will play a significant role in your startup\u2019s sustainability.\n\nLeveraging Technology in Your Startup\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-evolving landscape, leveraging technology can give your startup a competitive advantage. It can enhance efficiency, streamline processes, and facilitate scalability. Start by integrating cutting-edge tools and software that align with your operational needs, such as project management, customer relationship management (CRM), and data analytics tools. Furthermore, focusing on digital marketing strategies is essential for reaching a broader audience. Social media, email marketing, and SEO will elevate your online brand presence. Enhancing security protocols and data protection measures safeguards customer information and fosters trust. Regular training sessions for personnel on technology updates are also crucial, ensuring that your team remains proficient with the tools available. By prioritizing technology, your startup will be better positioned to adapt and grow in the competitive market.\n\nMaking informed decisions is essential to aligning your business with evolving customer needs, and embracing a mindset of improvement positions your startup for long-term viability and success. Establishing a tech startup in Dubai requires a blend of strategic planning, compliance, and community building. Each step is crucial in ensuring your business is well-positioned for growth in this thriving ecosystem. By understanding the local landscape, creating solid plans, complying with legal requirements, and fostering relationships, you set your startup on a path toward success."
