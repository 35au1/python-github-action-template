            "article_content": "I spent an entire day of CES wearing a little yellow bracelet. To the unsuspecting nearby humans, it probably looked like a fitness tracker. But the whole time, this yellow Pioneer wearable from Bee AI recorded everything around me. It wasn't storing audio like a typical recorder app, but it processed my conversations, then gave me personalized to-do lists and readable summaries of my in-person chats.\n\nA few days before the trade show, I spoke with the founder of another new company, Omi, which was officially unveiled for the first time today. Guess what it does? Record everything around you to create an activity log, and then have AI disseminate the information to give you actionable insights and tasks from your day, almost like a personal assistant. Omi's wearable can go around your neck, but it is best worn stuck to your forehead near your temple\u2014it has an electroencephalogram inside, and Omi claims that if you think specifically about talking to the wearable, the device will understand and perk up to receive your request.\n\nThis is the new world we're in, with artificially intelligent wearables continuously recording the world around us. Voice assistants\u2014which first landed in speakers and on our phones, but quickly moved to our wrists and faces\u2014at least required active engagement like a tap or a wake word to activate their ability to eavesdrop. But the next wave of hardware assistants, which also includes the forthcoming Friend pendant, can absorb information passively and work in the background. They are always listening.\n\nThe wearable hardware leading this space is often cheap\u2014Bee AI's watch is just $50, and Omi's stick-on bead is $89\u2014but the real magic is in the software, which often requires a subscription as it taps into multiple large language models to analyze your conversations.\n\nBee AI\n\nBee AI's yellow wearable listens to your interactions, then provides text transcripts in a mobile app. Photograph: Tristan deBrauwere\n\nBee AI was founded by Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin. Both previously worked at Squad (Sutin was the founder), which enabled media screen sharing in video chats so people could remotely watch the same movie or YouTube video together. The company was acquired by X (back when it was called Twitter), and the pair both joined briefly to work on Twitter Spaces. Zollo has previously worked at Tencent and Musical.ly, which subsequently became TikTok.\n\nSutin says he explored the idea of a personal AI assistant back in 2016 when chatbots were all the rage, but the technology wasn't there yet. That's not the case anymore. The company launched its Bee AI platform last February in beta, with an active community providing feedback. It only just began selling its Pioneer hardware a little more than a week ago. (The \u201cBee\u201d name plays with the idea of ambient computing, as if something is buzzing around and taking in information.) You don't need the company's hardware to use Bee AI\u2014you can just interact with the AI via the iPhone app\u2014but Zollo says the wearable offers a richer experience as it can record continuously all day. An Android app is on the way at the end of the month.\n\nThe wearable is simple. It has two microphones for noise isolation, and Sutin says that if you can hear the person you're speaking with in a busy environment, the wearable should be able to hear both parties as well. It can be worn as a band on the wrist or clipped to your shirt. There's an \u201cAction\u201d button in the center; pressing it once mutes the mics, and pressing it again enables them again. You can press and hold the button, and this action is user-configurable, so that can trigger things like processing the current conversation or awakening the \u201cBuzz\u201d AI assistant to ask it a question. (There's no speaker on the wearable, so answers will be spoken out through your phone.) When the mic is muted, there's a red LED. When it's recording, you'd think the green LED would be lit up, but there's nothing to indicate that this wearable is picking up everything around you."

He does leave things open when cautioning, \"I think it's possible that there are ghosts.\"\n\n\"Energy can't be destroyed,\" adds Hambel, who rhetorically asks, \"When it leaves the body, where does it go?\"\n\n\"There's dimensional elements to it, I think, that maybe we don't comprehend,\" concludes Schuler before embarking on an unnerving ghost hunt.\n\nAbout Paranormal Prison\n\nLoudwire has teamed up with Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents to bring you 12 brand new episodes of Paranormal Prison!\n\nWe invite you and your favorite artists inside Ohio State Reformatory, where Ohio's most violent criminals lost their lives, but some of their souls still remain.\n\nSeason 2 of Paranormal Prison will air each Wednesday at 1PM ET on Loudwire's YouTube channel.\n\nParanormal Prison: Season 2, Episode 9 - Biohazard\n\nIn this episode, the crew explores one of the most haunted areas of the prison \u2014 the attic.\n\nApril 21, 1930, a fire ignited by criminals at the maximum security Ohio Penitentiary killed 322 inmates and hospitalized another 230 in one of the deadliest fires in American prison history.\n\nThe 300 surviving inmates were relocated to Mansfield Ohio State Reformatory and locked in the attic every night for safety, where violence and murder reigned.\n\nClear voices from the other side answer prompts and the Biohazard bandmates later seem convinced that there is paranormal activity running rampant after seeing something that wound up not being there after all...\n\nWatch Episode 9 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Rockers Tell Their Wildest Tattoo Stories\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption.

            "article_content": "Have you ever been alone at home and something odd, like an unexplained sound or movement, happened? Your brain probably jumped to one of these conclusions \u2013 someone broke in, or there\u2019s a ghost.\n\nNow, imagine if there was actually a ghost and you had to live there knowing there was a spirit roaming around. Well, people in this list don\u2019t have to imagine it \u2013 they actually lived through it (or lied about it convincingly). So, let\u2019s dive in to read about their experiences. Just beware, after reading these stories, the next unexplained sound in your house might feel a lot scarier.\n\nMore info: Reddit\n\n#1\n\nI lived in a house once where the previous owners wife died there. He left a bunch of furniture including a rocking chair with a matching rocking leg rest.\n\n\n\nSo one night I came downstairs for a late night snack had to been after midnight and I was the only one down there, and there is this rocking chair and leg rest just rocking away all by themselves in sync.\n\nImage credits: Sniped_Yuh\n\n#2\n\nMy grandparents house has a ghost of an old lady that literally sits in the corner of the guest room and knits. I've only seen her twice and both times only frightened me because I never expect to see her.\n\nImage credits: seth_window26\n\n#3\n\nI was staying in an apt over an old theatre in a mining town.\n\nApt was easily 60' above the street.\n\nWoman, blue hued, in long dress... just appears in my peripheral vision. I turn to look.... And she does the same. We meet eyes while she pauses there watching me. She then walks across the room and out the front wall of the apt over the street. I look out the window and nothing.\n\n\n\nI'm like \"I need sleep\".\n\n\n\nI mention this to owner and he explains there was a balcony there but it was lost in a fire decades ago where a woman died trying to escape said fire. Now it's a solid wall where a doorway was. He just added \"long blue dress?\"\n\n\n\nLike bro..things you could have mentioned in the housing ad!\n\nImage credits: Syst0us\n\nOne of the most iconic sub-genres of horror movies is those about haunted houses, like The Changeling (1980), The Innocents (1961) and The Uninvited (1944), which Entertainment Weekly dubbed as three of the best movies of this sub-genre, where a ghost (or some other kind of supernatural creature) haunts a house and usually its residents. So, just the topic of haunted houses continues to interest people.\n\nWell, at least some people from this Reddit thread, where a netizen asked about their haunted house experiences, believe this phenomenon is real (or they\u2019re good liars).\n\n#4\n\nI live in a house where 3 people died. Mostly, its the doors opening and closing on their own. Its not even scary anymore, just frustrating. That and the footsteps coming from my attic, which is pretty terrifying when its like 2 AM and you hear footsteps above you. Especially when there is no way a human can get up there and walk around.\n\nImage credits: crimsonbaby_\n\n#5\n\nMy Dad was [taken from us] before I was born. When I was still in elementary school, I would feel someone tightening the cover on my bed at night. I would look around the room and didn't see anyone. When I told my Mom, she told me it was my Dad tucking me in. She said that he wanted me to be a girl. Also sometimes I would be out flying in the sky like the birds on his back. He would bring me back home when it would get dark. Then I would wake up and look around the room, and go back to sleep. It didn't scare me.\n\nImage credits: Thick_Curvy83\n\n#6\n\nHouse not too old (1950s) but haunted. After I moved in, I used to walk into my room and smell fresh flowers - I'm no gardener so dont have any in the house. Heard a man's voice call my name one night - no one knew my name in my town and the house next door was empty. Heard slippers scuffing up the hallway on carpet - that I'd just removed. It all felt pretty peaceful, just an older couple keeping an eye on things.\n\n\n\nOne night I heard a man cough in my lounge - it felt sinister and freaked my dog out so I smudged and crystalled. Nothing since.\n\nImage credits: kimikupkake\n\nWhile reading through these stories, you might think that some of them sound like scenarios from horror movies, like the ones we mentioned earlier. Well, the media a person consumes tends to affect their worldview. From opinions about world events to critical thinking and creativity, the media has influence over it all.\n\nSince horror movies are one of the most popular genres, a person likely watches at least one horror movie in their lifetime. Then, there are urban legends that are spread from person to person about hauntings, unexplained phenomena, and things like that. So, when you are aware of stories like that, it\u2019s natural to jump to conclusions that a certain event in your life is also due to the paranormal.\n\n#7\n\nCurrently live in \u201chaunted\u201d house, and we have had the usual happen: doors opening/closing by themselves, voices when no one is around, shadow people. The one thing that takes the cake though is the goddamn pizza! We were having dinner and watching television when a slice of pizza lifted up and flipped over toppings down and then flipped back over the other way! I\u2019m still scratch my head at how or why this happened.This sounds like a bad joke but trust me it isnt.\n\nImage credits: retailzombie87\n\n#8\n\nParents moved into a house where they believe the previous owners practiced witchcraft. The bought a house in New Hampshire and one of the rooms was painted red so they repaint, but my mom would hear things and the worst night was when my older sister who was like 4 at the time called my mom into her room and said \u201c look, there\u2019s a ghost over there!\u201d they moved out of that house a month after I was born. My mom blames my addiction to horror movies on that house.\n\nImage credits: elisejones14\n\n#9\n\nI moved into a house built in the 1890s several years ago. A few weeks after moving in, before meeting any neighbors, I heard heavy footsteps coming down the attic steps outside my bedroom. I then heard footsteps on the staircase for the first / second floor, and someone say my name. My husband was 30 miles away, nobody in town knew me or had access to my house, and there was nobody outside at the time. I grabbed my baby, phone and keys, and ran outside to wait. We searched the house top to bottom and never found anything, but I've heard the footsteps multiple times. We have no upstairs plumbing or hvac, so it remains unsolved.\n\n\n\nI've also heard music playing downstairs, talking to previous owners this was common. It's just commonplace now, and we don't always have stuff going on. A lot of major remodeling has been done, so I guess maybe that's why it's happening. Honestly the repairs are scarier than anything else.\n\nImage credits: ILuvMyLilTurtles\n\nGranted, we\u2019re not saying that all the stories shared in this list are made up. We\u2019re just pointing out that sometimes when an individual experiences something odd and nothing logical can explain it, their mind tends to fill in the gaps themselves. Especially, since the human brain tends to catastrophize (jump to the worst-case scenario), and let\u2019s admit \u2013 the haunting doesn\u2019t seem so fun.\n\nPlus, many reports of hauntings later get proven to be based on incorrect, misrepresented science, manipulation, assumption, and things like that.\n\nFor instance, in some cases, the houses that were claimed to be haunted were later found to have carbon monoxide leakage. So, the residents weren\u2019t being taunted by a ghost, they were simply experiencing CO poisoning symptoms like hallucinations, blurred vision, and feelings of dread.\n\n#10\n\nA light in my house kept coming back on when I had turned off-couple who formerly had that room were dead\n\n\n\nFelt Someone brush past me in condo, former tenant had died\n\n\n\nSaw a mans face with long hair and old style clothes on my TV, realized the TV was off\n\n\n\nHad a problem with my son, saw him in front of me on a sofa smiling at me, that spooked me!\n\n\n\nWhen my oldest brother died, I was not able to attend his funeral, he appeared, smiling in a blue shirt. He was buried in a blue shirt. Was very comforting to me\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\nI dont know why I see and dream things.\n\nImage credits: Chance-Ad-9111\n\n#11\n\n100 year old farmhouse.\n\n\n\nI used to hear a odd bell like noise once in a while.\n\nImage credits: anon\n\n#12\n\nI don't live in an old house, I live in an apartment building that is 11 years old. There's a ghost in my apartment. Don't experience it very often but on occasion it will turn on my iPod. Occasionally there will be scratching coming from the craft room door. And every now and then you will hear a growl. Once saw what seemed to be a small white dog dash behind my sofa; I checked and both of my doggos were sleeping on a chair on the other side of the room.\n\nImage credits: eatyourdamndinner\n\nOf course, sometimes there is some evidence that might suggest paranormal activity, like pressure, magnetic or temperature variations, maybe even some inexplicable photo, video, or audio data. Yet, there\u2019s a possibility that, again, there\u2019s nothing paranormal, and it\u2019s just some other cause that science hasn\u2019t been able to discover yet.\n\nOr maybe there are actual ghosts, but they\u2019ve managed to stay under our science\u2019s radar. So far, who knows what the future holds?\n\n#13\n\nWe live in a 150 year old farmhouse. The first week we lived here, my iPhone was sitting 5 or 6 feet away from me, hadn't been touched in a while (like 20 minutes or more) and Siri just said \"You are in my realm\". There was no history of the phone saying this, or of any activity.\n\n\n\nA few months later, my cat woke my up, waited at the foot of my bed and kept meowing until I got out of the bed. She went to the top of the stairs, and waited until I followed. Followed her downstairs and she just sat in the middle of the room. I checked a few things to make sure something hadn't caught fire or whatever, while she just sat in the middle of the room looking up the staircase. The house was SO quiet it was eerie and disturbing, usually something makes a noise in this place. I turned around to go upstairs, and thought I stood in something wet and bent over to check, but it was just a weird spot that was so cold, I thought my socks were wet. When I stood up, I felt a hand on my right shoulder. Nobody was there.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoors occasionally open, and TV remotes constantly go missing. We've lost I think 5 now, and have never found one. Every single piece of furniture has been removed from the TV room during renovations, so it's not like something ended up in a void under the couch.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, I was at a flea market and bumped into a former co-worker I hadn't seen in quite a while (who ended up living just around the corner). She pointed at a couple and said to go introduce myself, as they lived in our house in the 80s. I introduced myself, said I live in their old house and they immediately asked how the ghost was doing! Apparently it had a thing for TV remotes back then as well.\n\nImage credits: bandi53\n\n#14\n\nMy sister and I were just reminiscing the other day about this house we grew up in. We lived in a townhouse in a complex of low income rental homes for most of our childhoods. Very bad vibes in general, none of the three of us kids were ever alone in any part of the house at any time because we were dead terrified to be. I peed the couch once because my mother refused to accompany me upstairs to the washroom, and I was too scared to go alone. The house was built more upwards that outwards so it was a long tall steep staircase and long hallways. The bathroom was at the end of the hallway, and you had to cross the hall at the top of the stairs to turn on the hall light.\n\n\n\nWe've collectively experienced a few events ranging from bad feelings, recurring nightmares, strange occurences, to apparitions. Strange events include my sister sleep walking to the top of the stairs and screaming at the top of her lungs that I was going to die. She never did sleep walk again and to her chagrin I am alive and well. Apparitions include the man sitting at the dining room table the morning of my birthday, and the child in the stairwell window that had no landing to stand on beneath it. That was the only time we saw our parents acknowledge we had a problem, because we were looking at it from outside the house. We were the driveway, all 5 of us and our dog in the car after a camping trip. We stayed with family friends that night.\n\nImage credits: NastyLittleHobbitses\n\n#15\n\nMy house and my house before this, both were very old, my best friend's great grandpa lived in my current one. I'll just say what happens here. Everyday, at 2:30PM to 3:00PM, I'll hear banging underneath my floorboards as if someone is under the house and trying to get help/trying to get me underneath to [end] or kidnap me. I constantly feel watched through my windows as if my neighbor is looking at me while I'm dancing or getting dressed or anything. My dogs will be walking out of my room and just randomly look down the hall as if someone is walking there, but nobody would be in that vicinity/would be home with me. And just last night, I put my hand near the edge of my bed and something that wouldn't move if my hand moved had moved and touched the palm of my hand.\n\nImage credits: I_Like_Tamakis_Ears\n\n#16\n\nWhen my mom was about 8 months pregnant with me, my parents were trying to decide on my name (they weren\u2019t sure whether I\u2019d be a boy or girl). So in my house, built in the 1800s, there\u2019s a mini room through this coat closet that has a window overlooking the creepy basement stares. Basically, this house is super wacky.\n\n\n\nMy two older siblings, both less than 5 at that point, were unable to write their own names at this point in life (important to the story). They would play in this weird room. My mom would clean up the room pretty regularly because of my siblings.\n\n\n\nMy mom and dad finally decided on the names \u201cjulia\u201d or \u201cgrace\u201d for if I was a girl. However, one day, my mom went in the room to clean, and \u201cJulia Grace\u201d was written on the wall. My mom swore there were ghosts in our house, but this felt like it confirmed everything. She panicked, painted over the names, and named me something else entirely.\n\nImage credits: soopersecretformula\n\n#17\n\nWhen I was about 4 yrs/old? My parents lived in an farm house. My two older brothers shared a bedroom upstairs. I slept in my parents room (I believe) which was downstairs. Both of my parents, and both of my brothers, claim that the story is true.\n\n\n\nOn various nights, in the dead of night, the window in my brother's room would suddenly fly open. The room to their door would open and shut. Then there would be footfalls on the landing (think open walkway that looks down onto the living area) towards the stairs. The footfalls would then go down the stairs.\n\n\n\nWhen my parents heard my brothers scream, then the footfalls on the landing, they would rush towards the stairs just to see... nothing. The footfalls always ended at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\n\nWe didn't live there long and finally moved into another house.\n\nImage credits: valeran46\n\n#18\n\nSo this has been happening recently the first encounter happened when i was playing with my 2 year old brother and i was chasing him into our L shaped hallway and i saw him take a left and went into my sisters room and when i went there to get him he wasnt there but turns out he went into my mums room.\n\n\n\nThe second encounter happend at night randomly for 3 weeks where sometimes i was awake and sometimes i was outcold but the times i was asleep would wake up with objects that had no chance of of falling off my draw like my laptop or art books and when i was awake i would see something run across my dark room and nock off small things like controlers.\n\n\n\nThis may not be as scary as the rest of the storys but this is my experience.\n\nImage credits: MrGoose6969\n\n#19\n\nThere were poltergeists in the apartment where I was living. We were three flatmates, one guy that did not believe in anything paranormal, and me and my best friend. I started hearing noises at night, our two bedrooms were side by side and there was something knocking from her side, like something made of glass. We investigated, turned out it was the bottles she kept in her room shaking by themselves at night. Got worse later. Some of her clothes were teleporting to my room when we were outside together. One day I was spending a week alone there, I heard my keys shaking on the door when I was trying to sleep. The morning after, I found the strap (5 centimeters long?) of my keys completely and tightly wrapped around the ring that was holding my keys together. Same day, there was a black mass in the corridor and the curtain of the bathtub was moving by itself, I still remember the sound it was making on the metal pipe. Nearly got an anxiety attack, I called my best friend and she came back early from her holidays to stay with me. My dad called a medium and a lady to make a spiritual cleanse.\n\nImage credits: Successful_Pea_1492\n\n#20\n\nI lived in my parents guest house when I was younger one night my kids were crying in the other room and I got up to check on them and they were on a bunk bed when I went in their room 2 shadow figurs were leaning over them and turned to me I screamed and ran towards them grabbed them with the shadow figures beside me and ran out I never screamed like that or felt fear like that before.\n\nImage credits: BeckoningCube1\n\n#21\n\nI had the odd experience growing up that my sceptical adult brain could probably chalk up to a wild imagination or something now, but it's interesting how my mum agreed with me that there was a presence in the house when I shared it with her. She told me she feels a presence in her bedroom sometimes, like she feels completely fine before she goes into the room and then when she passes through the door there's a strange feeling like there's someone there. It's always at the top of the stairs near my room and my parents' room. One time we were having construction done at the bottom of the stairs, my Dad saw something at the top of the landing, Mum says he jumped like he'd seen a -well- he'll deny all knowledge of that if you asked him about it now. We're not sure what exactly he saw, we only know whatever he did see scared someone who's usually quite bravely inclined.\n\n\n\nBut anyway, my experience is the only one I can vouch for. It most definitely could have been a trick of the light, but I'll let you all make up your minds, it's fun to speculate. I must've been about 15-16, I was lying in bed and the door was slightly ajar, it wasn't nighttime, but I was sleepy so I decided to take some time out. It's worth noting that everyone in the house was downstairs and we had a baby gate at the bottom of the stair's because my brother's children were over, I definitely would've heard people coming up our old creaky stairs because my room is the one closest to them (and they're old and creaky). So anyway I'm lying in bed looking at the door and I see a tall shadow travel from the stairs into my mum's room, from what I remember I think it eclipses the door completely. I remember picking my head up and calling \"mum?\", I remember how confused I was because I didn't hear the footsteps. I got up and looked around, there was no one upstairs.\n\n\n\nIf we're entertaining this as an apparition I don't think it's harmful or malicious. I've never felt in danger, but there are constantly shadows in my parents' room that we can't explain, it looks like a head and shoulders and nothing seems to be casting it, very spooky. I have loads of other experiences, but again, it's all speculation isn't it.\n\nImage credits: L3guana"

            "article_content": "It was a phone call for the history books.\n\nOn one end of the line, Kenneth Brugger, a textile engineer turned amateur naturalist living in Mexico. On the other, Fred Urquhart, a University of Toronto zoologist who, for decades, had been puzzling over an entomological conundrum: Where do monarch butterflies go in winter?\n\n\u201cWe have found them \u2013 millions of monarchs \u2013 in evergreens beside a mountain clearing,\u201d said Brugger, according to Urquhart\u2019s own account, published in National Geographic. As Urquhart relayed, the excited call came 50 years ago this week, on the evening of Jan. 9, 1975.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Zoologist Fred Urquhart had long wanted to trace the migration patterns of North America\u2019s eastern monarch butterfly population.University of Toronto Archives/Supplied\n\nBrugger and his wife Cathy (born Catalina Aguado) had been hiking through forested slopes in the mountains west of Mexico City. It was there that they found what they were looking for: millions of orange-and-black butterflies covering the trees. Their search had begun in response to an ad that Urquhart\u2019s wife and research partner, Norah Urquhart, had placed in Mexican newspapers. The Canadian duo were seeking volunteers to help trace the migration patterns of North America\u2019s eastern monarch butterfly population to its mysterious terminus.\n\nWhat resulted forever changed how science and culture view the colourful insect. More than a delightful springtime ornament, the monarch is now considered a veritable wonder of nature, in which successive generations move northward in summer, leaving a single, long-lived \u201csuper generation\u201d to make the return trip in fall. It is then that millions of butterflies cross thousands of kilometres to reach the species\u2019s isolated Mexican redoubt and renew the population for the following spring.\n\nFifty years on, the epic migration continues to be the focus of scientific study and public fascination.\n\n\u201cThis particular species inspires so many people,\u201d said Antonia Guidotti, an entomologist at the Royal Ontario Museum. She called the monarch \u201ca gateway insect,\u201d because it can help people overcome their inner ick and appreciate the many six-legged life forms that share the planet with us.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The ROM's Department of Natural History entomologist Antonia Guidotti explains the monarch is 'a gateway insect,' helping people overcome their fears of insects.Chloe Ellingson/The Globe and Mail\n\nPerhaps more than any other creature, monarchs also illustrate how much the protection of migrating species relies on cross-border co-operation. It was not by accident that monarchs fluttered their way onto the agenda in the summer of 2016, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with his then-counterparts U.S. president Barack Obama and Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to usher in a trilateral plan to aid the butterfly.\n\nToday, the politics of that \u201cthree amigos\u201d summit have never looked more distant. But the monarch retains its symbolic significance as a pan-North American concern \u2013 a point underscored last month when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the species for protected status. Canada listed the iconic butterfly as endangered in 2023, more than 25 years after scientists began warning Ottawa of its decline.\n\nThe precarious status of the monarch is most directly assessed in Mexico, where each winter the eastern population is concentrated in a handful locations. While numbers fluctuate from year to year, they have been on a downward trend for decades. Last year\u2019s count, conducted by WWF Mexico in collaboration with the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve and other partners, was the second lowest on record. Nine colonies of butterflies were observed covering just 0.9 hectares of total area, a 59-per-cent drop from the previous year.\n\nThe collection of monarch butterflies at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto include some with the original tags from Urquharts' team. Chloe Ellingson/The Globe and Mail\n\nScientists have identified multiple causes for the monarchs\u2019 decline. They include forest degradation in Mexico and a steep reduction in the amount of milkweed growing on agricultural land in the United States and in Canada after the adoption of the chemical herbicide glyphosate. Monarchs use milkweed exclusively for laying eggs as they move northward in spring and summer, in sync with the plant\u2019s growing season.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Norah and Fred Urquhart started experimenting with adhesive labels in the late 1930s.Ken Jones/University of Toronto Scarborough Library's Digital Collections/Supplied\n\nNow, research suggests that climate change has become a growing threat to monarchs. In particular, warmer-than-average temperatures during the insect\u2019s breeding season can throw a monkey wrench into its well-tuned metabolism by affecting food availability, energy needs and reproductive rates. The result drives down the population and means there are fewer butterflies attempting the fall migration to Mexico.\n\nIt can be argued that none of this would be known today without Urquhart, who was born in Toronto in 1911. Fascinated with monarchs since boyhood, his interest matured into a lifelong research career, which began while he was still a graduate student at the University of Toronto. As early as 1937 he and Norah were experimenting with how to put adhesive labels on butterfly wings so that the monarchs could be found and tracked.\n\nIt was a trial-and-error effort in which \u201cbutterflies got tangled and sticky,\u201d as Urquhart wrote, forcing them back to the drawing board. By the 1950s, he was director of zoology and paleontology at the ROM and the couple had their method down. In 1952 they began enlisting volunteers to aid in the butterfly-tagging effort. That year a dozen participants responded. Eventually, thousand of individual contributors would become involved. Each tag included the words: Send to Zoology University Toronto Canada.\n\nAs tagged butterfly wings turned up across the continent, many were returned by mail to the Urquharts by people who heeded the message. It was these responses that collectively led the couple to focus on Mexico as the likely location for the insects\u2019 wintering grounds \u2013 an early and highly successful example of what would today be called citizen science.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The original butterfly tags included the words: Send to Zoology University Toronto Canada, where many were returned by mail to the Urquharts.Antonia Guidotti/ROM/Supplied\n\n\u201cIt was all because of this one colourful, remarkable insect,\u201d said Don Davis, a Toronto-based naturalist who joined the tagging operation as a high-school student in 1967 and now chairs the Monarch Butterfly Fund. Davis also holds some serious lepidopteran bragging rights: A butterfly he tagged was the first from Ontario to be recovered in Mexico.\n\nThe monarch\u2019s winter home among the oyamel firs of Mexico\u2019s Sierre Madre was known to people living in the region. But it was the tagging begun by the Urquharts that established that monarchs were arriving there from as far away as Canada. It was a stunning find that could reasonably be called \u201cthe greatest entomological discovery of the 20th century,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe ROM\u2019s collection of monarchs include two that bear original stickers from the project. Some others can also be seen as part of a temporary exhibition at the museum called Nature in Brilliant Colour.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The tags the Urquharts attached to the butterflies help them discover the butterflies migrate all the way to Mexico for the winter.Marco Ugarte/The Associated Press\n\nThe year after the Urquharts received their historic phone call from Kenneth Brugger, they journeyed to Mexico to see the site for themselves. They found monarchs everywhere.\n\n\u201cThey swirled through the air like autumn leaves and carpeted the ground in their myriads,\u201d wrote Urquhart in his National Geographic piece. The story, published in August, 1976, is well-remembered for its iconic cover photo of a butterfly-covered Cathy Brugger.\n\nKenneth Brugger died in 1998; Fred and Norah Urquhart passed away in 2002 and 2009 respectively. Cathy Brugger, who later remarried and became Catalina Trail, is 81 and lives in Texas.\n\nFive decades later, the allure of the monarch is undiminished. How long their extraordinary journey can continue is now a question for this generation and beyond."

            "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\nThe University\u2019s Museum of Natural History is located on the southern end of campus, in a repurposed library space. Visitors are greeted by a mountain lion, looking ready to pounce. The small lobby includes displays about Nevada\u2019s mammals, native bird species, live beetles and reptiles and two live fish exhibits. Visitors that have coordinated a tour with one of the museum\u2019s curators can experience what is arguably the most exciting part of the museum: its scientific collections of over one million biological specimens, mostly held in large metal cabinets behind the exhibit space. The museum may have a modest footprint, but it holds biological treasures of scientific importance and conducts substantial public engagement.\n\nWith three faculty curators and two full-time staff members, education and collections coordinator Cynthia Scholl '08 (biology), '12 M.S. (biology), and herbarium curator Jerry Tiehm '74 (wildlife ecology), '78 M.S. (botany), the museum has an impressive list of accomplishments over the past year, including extensive public outreach. In 2023, the museum hosted over 3,000 visitors, including over 2,000 local schoolchildren.\n\nFor a museum funded primarily by grants and gifts, the director is proud of how far the museum has come in its 10 years on campus.\n\n\"We are small but mighty,\" Beth Leger, foundation professor in the Department of Biology and director of the Museum of Natural History, said.\n\nAn unnatural history\n\nThe Museum of Natural History wasn\u2019t always a part of the University\u2019s strategy, but for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, it was important to have a place that could house and properly maintain the specimens that University students and researchers had collected over the long history of the institution. The museum holds plant and animal collections that date back to the 1850s, but it wasn\u2019t officially established as a museum until 2013.\n\nWhen the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center was built, it opened up space previously occupied by the life sciences library in the Max C. Fleischmann Building.\n\nLeger, a plant ecologist, was associated with the University\u2019s herbarium at the time and was asked to join a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant review panel about collections. She had the opportunity to learn about other community and university museums and their collections through proposal reviews and conversations with other panelists.\n\n\"And I thought, 'Why don't we have a museum? We should have a museum,'\" Leger said. \"I\u2019m seeing, literally, how it\u2019s done. I\u2019m reading about how other people are doing it, which is exactly what the NSF wants, this cross-pollination.\"\n\nShe asked her colleague Chris Feldman to join her for a cup of coffee, and broached the idea of building a museum. Feldman, a herpetologist who has a museum background, loved the idea, and the two of them got to work putting together a proposal to their respective chairs and deans. Professor Feldman was based in the College of Science\u2019s biology department, and at the time, Leger was based in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Science in the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources (CABNR).\n\nJeff Thompson and Ron Pardini, the respective deans of the College of Science and CABNR at that time, approved and submitted the proposal to University administrators.\n\n\"And not only did they say yes, we could have the space, they also gave us money to renovate,\" Leger said.\n\nShe added that it felt very lucky for all the pieces to fall together as they did.\n\n\"We just happened to have the space, we just happened to have the people, and all this came together in this very beautiful way,\" Leger said.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for what Beth and Chris do,\" Scholl said. \"There\u2019s always been someone working on the collections and trying to safeguard them. And there is a lot of history that we don't know.\"\n\nOne piece of known history near and dear to Scholl\u2019s heart is Fred Ryser, who was faculty at the University from 1958 to 1989. Ryser was one of the museum\u2019s most prolific collectors, having added birds, mammals, fish, plants and butterflies to the collections. Scholl is the cofounder and associate director of the nonprofit Nevada Bugs & Butterflies and has researched butterflies in the Great Basin for years. Ryser\u2019s butterfly collection represents some of the oldest documentation of species found around Reno.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know much about him besides his collection history, but I know I love him,\" Scholl said.\n\nTiehm, the museum\u2019s plant curator, has written a book about Nevada\u2019s plant collectors, which includes many emeritus University faculty.\n\nBiological specimens, which are preserved plants and animals, provide essential teaching and research material that serves as the foundation for a range of biological disciplines, from taxonomy to community ecology. Students and faculty at the University amassed some \"wonderful\" collections of the plants and animals of Nevada and the Great Basin Desert, recording the native biodiversity of the region over the years. Managing all these specimens, however, was not an easy task, and before the establishment of the Museum of Natural History, there was no central plan for oversight of specimens.\n\nThe Dixie Valley toad was discovered by Professor Emeritus Dick Tracy and alumna Michelle Gordon '06 (biology), '17 M.S. (biology).\n\nMaintaining collections is costly and time-consuming, and oftentimes falls on those who collected the specimens in the first place or those who inherited somebody else\u2019s collections. In the late 1980s, research priorities shifted away from studies of individual plants and animals. At the same time, there were a series of faculty retirements in the biology department. The department decided to move all its animal specimens into space in the Nevada Terawatt Facility in Stead. There, the animal collections languished for decades, away from the watchful eyes of faculty or the curious hands of students, while the plant collection was housed in a small room in a University building on Valley Road. Years later, two emeritus biology faculty, Dick Tracy and the late Peter Brussard, brought Feldman out to Stead to see the collections.\n\nHe immediately understood their scientific value, but also their precarious situation. Thousands of fish, amphibians and reptiles were stored in jars of alcohol, hundreds of birds and mammal skins and skulls in cabinets, and thousands of pinned insects in cases. Feldman began to regularly travel to the Terawatt facility so he could top off the jars with ethanol to save the fluid-preserved specimens and manage pests that might damage the dry specimens.\n\nSome of those specimens lie in preservation containers called coffins, which are also used for human cadavers. Leger visited the Terawatt facility with Feldman once and described the random specimens lying in coffins as \"creepy.\"\n\n\"We still have specimens there, some really big things,\" Leger said.\n\nThe College of Science\u2019s other museum curators can relate to the problems the curators of the Museum of Natural History are facing \u2013 there\u2019s no more space.\n\n\"We have literally run out of weird closets at the University,\" Leger said.\n\nThe largest challenge is ethanol collections, which preserve animal specimens in alcohol. Those specimens need to be stored in fire-safe containers, and all buildings have limits on the amount of alcohol they can store for fire safety. Moving the specimens into safe containers has also proven difficult, as many are kept in large glass jars that are no longer made at that size because they\u2019re unstable and prone to cracking. But the challenges faced by the curators don\u2019t deter them from the work.\n\n\"I'm very grateful for what we have,\" Scholl said.\n\nShe acknowledges that while a larger museum space would be ideal, there is still space to teach middle school classes, engage with undergraduates and support researchers. Leger\u2019s main concern is ensuring the museum\u2019s specimens don\u2019t experience a similar fate to those left behind at the Terawatt facility.\n\n\"Collections cannot rest on the enthusiasm of one person, because they last longer than one person's lifespan,\" Leger said.\n\nMuseum curation\n\nFortunately, Leger and Feldman have recruited several additional dedicated curators.\n\n\"We have curators for each section,\" Leger said, including plants, insects and vertebrates.\n\nScholl points out that the way specimens are collected and how collections are maintained can differ by background. Research collections typically have meticulous documentation and are stored to maintain specimens in excellent condition for future genetic analysis. Specimens collected for teaching purposes might not have research or documentation value, but they have outreach value.\n\nWhile the museum does accept collections from outside the University, \"you do not just get something into Jerry\u2019s plant collection without it being perfect,\" Leger said.\n\nTiehm named a new species of ranunculus after Beth Leger. R. legerae is found outside of Elko, hence its common name: Elko Buttercup. (Photo by Jan Nachlinger.)\n\nTiehm\u2019s work is detailed and he maintains a thorough collection of plants, with a focus on Nevada\u2019s flora. Tiehm has spent many years venturing into Nevada\u2019s wilderness and documenting its native plants. He and Jan Nachlinger '85 M.S. (botany), a retired ecologist, have compiled a complete list of Nevada\u2019s native plants, which will be published sometime in the next two years.\n\n\"This information exists nowhere else,\" Leger said.\n\nThe museum\u2019s insect curators include Matt Forister, the Trevor J. McMinn Endowed Professor in Biology and Foundation Professor, and Lee Dyer, Foundation Professor. The museum also receives specimens and identification support from Nevada Bugs and Butterflies, an organization run by Scholl and her husband, Kevin Burls '14 Ph.D. (ecology, evolution and conservation biology).\n\nFeldman is the museum\u2019s curator of vertebrates, including reptiles, mammals and birds. Some of the specimens in the museum were collected before regulations to protect species and limit poaching were established. The museum curators very carefully follow regulations when identifying which specimens to accept into the museum collections. Feldman has worked to establish permits that allow him to accept donations of already-dead animals, like roadkill.\n\nMuseum centers outreach and research\n\nRebounding after the pandemic shutdown, the spring semester of 2024 was the busiest yet, with four to five museum events each week, keeping Scholl busy.\n\n\"The only reason we have an outreach program is because of Cynthia,\" Leger said. \"We do what we think we can succeed at, and what feels good to Cynthia is this very organic science education based on place and local research, which is super unique.\"\n\nScholl curates the museum tours to focus on local natural history or on research being done by faculty at the University.\n\nWith this approach, \"they\u2019re asking the same questions the researchers are,\" Scholl said.\n\n\"In the last few years, I've gotten to involve more undergraduate students in curation,\" Scholl said. \"Some subset of the undergrads have helped with outreach. They really enjoy these unique work opportunities.\"\n\nFunded by a combination of grants and gifts, 14 paid positions were offered to undergraduates in 2023. Scholl added that, in addition to learning curatorial practices, outreach provides an opportunity for undergraduates to practice their science communication skills by simplifying science for, most often, a younger audience. The Museum of Natural History has begun to host larger and larger events, particularly by recruiting graduate student volunteers. Scholl has entire spreadsheets she\u2019s developed to recruit and organize graduate students who want to be involved in outreach.\n\n\"It's really great to have a big enough community that the students who want to do this can,\" Scholl said.\n\nThe museum has also recently started hosting identification workshops. So far, there have been bee, butterfly and plant identification workshops. Attendees include state and federal agency employees, students, hobbyists and other specialists.\n\nGraduate students volunteer at a \"Science Saturday\" event.\n\nThe museum also participates in University recruitment efforts like Nevada Bound and has been a part of many students\u2019 first experiences on campus by hosting lessons for NevadaFIT.\n\n\n\nResearch projects by faculty whose work requires collecting and maintaining specimens also receive support from the museum, and training projects associated with the research grants utilize collections from the Museum of Natural History.\n\n\n\n\"This is why we are critical,\" Leger said. \"We are serving so many of the University\u2019s goals outlined in its strategic plan.\"\n\nOne particularly clever use of the museum\u2019s collections was led by postdoctoral researcher Behnaz Balmaki, who investigated historic butterfly-plant interactions. Balmaki analyzed the types of pollen on the legs of butterflies in the collections and compared that to pollen found on wild-caught butterflies. Some species are extremely particular about the plants they visit, and as some plants become more vulnerable due to climate change, examining how those interactions have shifted over time allows scientists to better understand how butterflies might adapt.\n\nLeger and Scholl are also excited about a collection of aquatic invertebrates that they hope can take up residence near their original home at the University of Nevada, Reno at Lake Tahoe. Along with Aaron Koning, a recent faculty hire in the Department of Biology, they are currently developing a proposal to build an exhibit about the natural history of aquatic insects in and surrounding the lake.\n\nDreaming big\n\nThe museum directors and curators would love to move the collections and public space to the ground floor of a new building one day, in a space that is purposefully built to store the many irreplaceable, priceless treasures in the collection.\n\n\"The University\u2019s biodiversity collections are being cared for like never before but integrating them into an easily accessible space with earthquake and fire protection would be the absolute dream,\" Leger says.\n\nIn the short term, Scholl dreams of funding for school buses to transport students from Title I schools to the museum so there are no barriers for students attending underprivileged schools to learning about Nevada\u2019s natural history.\n\nScholl also emphasized that it can be difficult to help children understand that \"\u2026 these dead things help us protect things in the wild.\" To that end, Scholl would love more outdoor teaching spaces to work with children, where living pollinators and other organisms might visit.\n\n\"We are biologists because we love to be outside, because being in nature is healing, because looking at bees for an hour is extraordinary,\" Scholl said.\n\nFor Leger, the priority is \"dipping the museum\u2019s fingers into as many pies as possible\" to ensure all the museum\u2019s collections don\u2019t end up in some equivalent of the Terawatt facility, after the current batch of curators retire. Leger hopes to work with a donor whose vision for the museum extends as far into the future as hers.\n\n\"The way you codify it is just by becoming inevitable,\" Leger said. \"These collections will last indefinitely if we keep giving them the support they need.\""

            "article_content": "We\u2019re only one week into 2025, but, already, OpenAI is having a tough year. Here is everything that\u2019s gone wrong for the influential company in the last seven days, and a quick look at the potential frustrations and headwinds that it faces as it heads into the new year.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s sister sues him\n\nAnnie Altman, the sister of the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has sued the executive, accusing him of sexual abuse. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri on Monday, makes claims that Altman abused his sister when she was three years old and he was 12. The suit claims that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts of sexual assault,\u201d Annie suffered \u201csevere emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which is expected to continue into the future.\u201d The suit asks for damages in excess of $75,000, as well as a jury trial.\n\nThe allegations of abuse have circulated the web for over a year and first gained mainstream attention in the days after Altman was controversially ousted from OpenAI (he would later be reinstated). The litigation has obviously pushed the claims to a much wider audience. Were the case to head to trial, it could prove disastrous for OpenAI from a PR perspective.\n\nAltman\u2019s family released a statement Wednesday responding to Annie\u2019s litigation. \u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refused conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d The statement, which Altman shared on X, further characterizes Annie as mentally unwell and financially motivated. It states that though the family has financially supported Annie for years and she \u201ccontinues to demand more money\u201d from them.\n\nA former employee\u2019s family accuses the company of murder\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has also been subjected to conspiracy theories that allege it murdered a former employee. The death of Suchir Balaji on November 26th inspired immediate suspicion, despite the fact that the San Francisco Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has dubbed the death a suicide. That\u2019s because, in the months before his death, Balaji acted as a corporate whistleblower, making claims that the company was breaking U.S. copyright law. Only a few weeks before his death, Balaji penned an online essay in which he claimed to show that the company\u2019s approach to content generation did not fall under the U.S. definition of \u201cfair use.\u201d\n\nWhile police have said that there is \u201cno evidence of foul play\u201d in Balaji\u2019s case, his family has claimed that he was murdered by OpenAI and has demanded that the FBI investigate his death. In an interview with The San Francisco Standard, the Balaji family relayed that they \u201cbelieved their son was murdered at the behest of OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a $100 billion industry that\u2019d be turned upside down by his testimony,\u201d said Poornima Ramarao, his mother. \u201cIt could be a group of people involved, a group of companies, a complete nexus.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy hasn\u2019t been made publicly available yet.\n\nThe Cybertruck bomber allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his attack\n\nTo top things off, it was recently learned that the guy who blew himself up in a Cybertruck outside of Trump Tower used ChatGPT to plot the attack. Las Vegas police recently revealed details to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis is the first incident that I\u2019m aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\u201d said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. \u201cIt\u2019s a concerning moment.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly something that OpenAI is going to want to include in its ad copy (\u201cUseful for planning terrorist attacks!\u201d just doesn\u2019t have a great ring to it).\n\nPolitical headwinds\n\nOpenAI doesn\u2019t just face a slew of bizarre, splashy scandals, it also faces the political realities of Trump\u2019s second presidency. Elon Musk, the company\u2019s former founder (and investor) turned worst enemy, notably helped Trump win and is now enjoying unparalleled access to the federal government\u2019s levers of power. At the same time that he\u2019s been dubbed America\u2019s \u201cco-president,\u201d Musk is also waging a legal war on OpenAI that, while having been dubbed \u201cfrivolous\u201d by OpenAI, shows no signs of going anywhere.\n\nThe lawsuit that Musk filed last year alleges that the company has betrayed its original mission in favor of pursuing a for-profit business model (OpenAI did recently announce it would be ditching its original, weird structure to pursue a more traditional business strategy). When last we checked in on that litigation effort last November, Musk had expanded the lawsuit to include other entities close to OpenAI, including its backer, Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, while Musk is engaged in the legal battle, and may be able to manipulate federal policy in ways that could prove disruptive to OpenAI, he can also leverage the soft power of his media platform, X, to damage the company\u2019s reputation. Indeed, Musk and his affiliates have seized on some of OpenAI\u2019s recent controversies, openly spreading damaging conspiracy theories. The Standard notes that, after Suchir Balaji died, Musk and others close to him helped to spread the conspiracy theories surrounding the coder\u2019s death: \u201cWhen Ramarao (Balaji\u2019s mother) tweeted about hiring the private investigator, Musk replied: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nThe fraught economics of OpenAI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s biggest dilemma may be less political than economic. That is, the massive amounts of money that are being used to prop up the company have left many onlookers wondering: Is OpenAI\u2019s business model even sustainable? Last year, the company self-reported that it lost some $5 billion, while garnering substantially less money in revenue. OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will grow to some $11 billion by the end of this year and will continue to explode exponentially in the years to come.\n\nIndeed, OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will reach $100 billion by the year 2029\u2014a mere four years from now. Granted, as a company, OpenAI has grown at breakneck speed (its revenue jumped 1,700 percent in the space of a year, the New York Times has reported), though skeptics still see its projections as PR fantasies designed to draw in perpetual cash infusions from true believers in the venture capital realm. Blogger Ed Zitron, who has referred to OpenAI as an \u201cunsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company,\u201d notes that the company\u2019s own estimations of its future revenue capacity are \u201cfucking ridiculous.\u201d Firmly repping the doubter camp, Zitron writes:\n\n\u2026the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it\u2019s not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.\n\nZitron notes that OpenAI seems to make a majority of its revenue from subscriptions to ChatGPT, which doesn\u2019t seem to be making enough money to make up for its ongoing losses. OpenAI also makes money by licensing usage of its algorithmic models for use in software products. As it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if their revenue increases if the cost of providing service remains so high. Sure, it could jack up prices, but OpenAI has competitors with deep pockets and similar benchmarks.\n\nIn short: OpenAI has its work cut out for it. Beset by powerful adversaries, ongoing lawsuits, and looming scandals that could prove disastrous for the company\u2019s brand, the company needs to prove that the media hype that carried it through the last few years can actually translate into cold hard dollars and cents. It\u2019s unclear, at this point at least, how it\u2019s going to do that."

We may get a commission if you buy through our links.\n\nMicrosoft is starting strong the new year, pedaling hard on AI. According to a new blog post, the software giant is laying out the next big 6 trends that will shape the industry and workplaces by using AI agents.\n\nAI is poised for its next major leap. Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024, with organizations achieving a return of $3.70 for every $1 invested. AI is expected to contribute $2.7 trillion to Europe\u2019s GDP by 2030, as adoption accelerates, and businesses unlock value in as little as 13 months.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s predictions are mostly based on the latest IDC study cited in another blog post from the Redmont giant.\n\nHere are the key AI trends for 2025 according to Microsoft\n\n1. More capable and useful AI models\n\nMicrosoft believes that the AI models will continue to evolve into more capable version that will help solve a lot of complex problems in all areas including science, healthcare and even law. Generating code, executing workflows efficiently and comparing contracts will become the advanced tasks for the AI agents that will push forward the organization\u2019s productivity.\n\n2. The AI bots will redefine the work\n\nAn obvious prediction for AI agents is that they will take on the repetitive tasks that we don\u2019t want to deal with anymore. Microsoft mentions IT troubleshooting and workflow optimization, along with building workflows and writing code for developers that will only need to provide final touches to it. That makes a lot of sense, and we can already see a development in all those areas.\n\n3. AI agents will become our everyday companions\n\nAs you might have thought, Microsoft thinks that Copilot and its features such as Vision will become your new close buddy, providing all the information you need. Moreover, the bot will also discuss with you and disseminate the information to make things a lot more engaging and comprehensible.\n\nWhile we can see this going on in the future, probably 2025 is not the year this will suddenly happening. According to a Business of apps usage statistics, about 300 million people used AI apps in 2024. That includes all AI apps, not just Copilot.\n\nAccording to the same study, in October 2024, Copilot had 28 million active users and in September, the AI bot had 37 million visits. Those are hardly numbers to brag when we\u2019re talking about a solution becoming mainstream. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Copilot can\u2019t be your friend if you want to, but we can\u2019t talk about AI agents starting to be every day companions.\n\n4. AI development will become more sustainable\n\nRight now, AI models use a lot of power and water to cool down those servers and the next major prediction is that the AI business will become more sustainable.\n\nMicrosoft is advancing green AI, building data centers that use zero water for cooling and operate on carbon-free energy sources like wind, geothermal, nuclear, and solar power. By 2030, Microsoft aims to be a carbon-negative, water-positive, and zero-waste company.\n\nThe only scary thing in the Microsoft rhetoric is nuclear, mentioned as a carbon-free energy source. Knowing the basics about this power source from the 80\u2019s, although being efficient, the nuclear powerplants still generate a disturbing amount of waste that we didn\u2019t yet learn how to dispose of properly.\n\n5. AI will be better kept in check\n\nThe most important problem right now with AI is that it doesn\u2019t really have any serious guardrails. Microsoft is seeing a change in 2025 for that aspect and it\u2019s testing how to address AI inaccuracies and limit the potential destructive power of AI being used irresponsibly.\n\nAlthough Microsoft is taking that task upon themselves, there are AI bots out there that can be customized in any aspect possible, providing means for wrongdoers to perform cyberattacks and other destructive actions.\n\n6. AI models will lead to scientific breakthroughs\n\nWith AI being very effective in performing a lot of calculations, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the computational models already have an impact in science discoveries. Microsoft\u2019s point is that along with improved models new innovations in research will also follow. They mention climate change study and public health being the major domains for development.\n\nLastly, Microsoft envisions a new era between AI models and agents led by an improvement on how Ai models will be trained.\n\nWith Microsoft investing billions of dollars into AI, we will clearly see new advancements in AI models and research. Whether or not 2025 will mark a cornerstone for AI remains to be seen. However, users don\u2019t seem so enthusiastic about using it so far. Actually, Copilot with its Windows Recall might be one of the reasons why Windows 10 users are not so keen in upgrading to Windows 11 just yet.\n\nWhat do you think about Microsoft\u2019s AI predictions for 2025? Let us know in the comments below."

            "article_content": "Grain prices have gotten off to a positive start in 2025, continuing the vein of form they found in December.\n\nEuropean prices are seeing the main lift, while UK and US prices have seen some falls. US prices were positive this week.\n\nThe French wheat price for December 2025 was at \u20ac233.75/t on Wednesday afternoon this week. It was relatively steady since the end of last week.\n\nOn 20 December, that price was at \u20ac226.75/t. It increased to \u20ac230.25/t on 27 December and on 3 January moved to \u20ac232.75/t.\n\nThe Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) in the UK is not predicting any big move in prices in the coming months.\n\nCommenting on wheat prices this week, it said: \u201cUnfavourable weather in the US and Russia, plus maize concerns in Argentina, offer support to prices short term.\n\n\u201cBut harvest pressures in the southern hemisphere may limit longer-term price gains.\u201d\n\nMaize prices have remained up in Europe and have gone back up in the US.\n\nHigh maize prices are generally a good thing for grain prices in Ireland, as maize becomes less attractive in animal feed if it is more expensive than wheat or barley.\n\nThere are concerns about the maize crop in Argentina, but a large crop is expected from Brazil so this may offset losses.\n\nFeed barley prices in France had moved up over the Christmas period, but went back down this week to \u20ac202/t in some regions.\n\nThe FOB Creil price for spring malting barley is steady at \u20ac240/t. It looks like there is very little trading happening in that market at present.\n\nOilseed rape\n\nHigh oil prices may be helping rapeseed prices. However, a large soybean crop could affect the rapeseed price. However, hot and dry weather is reported to be damaging soy bean crops in Argentina.\n\nOn 20 December, the November French oilseed rape price was at \u20ac464/t.\n\nIt moved to \u20ac461/t on 27 December, but on 3 January had increased to \u20ac470/t. On Wednesday afternoon this week, it had moved up again to \u20ac477.25/t.\n\nNative prices\n\nAt home, prices have been rising slowly but steadily. In November spot barley was reported around \u20ac220/t to \u20ac225/t.\n\nIn December, it moved to \u20ac230/t and in early January it is now at \u20ac230/t to \u20ac235/t.\n\nSpot wheat is also reported to have increased to \u20ac245/t to \u20ac250/t. November prices are looking similar to these prices.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the AHDB reported a spot barley price of \u00a3201/t on 3 January and a forward price for February of \u00a3204/t. All of these prices are dried unless otherwise stated."

There were just over 26,000 cattle exported for direct slaughter in 2024, with the current price differential expected to drive numbers in 2025 as well.\n\nBeef quotes across the water continue to improve, with quotes up 10p to 15p/kg from before Christmas. Some large feeders have been able to get \u00a35.65/kg (\u20ac7.18/kg incl VAT) for in-spec stock this week, which is a big improvement on pre-Christmas quotes. A gap of over \u20ac1/kg remains between the English and Irish beef price.\n\nNI comment\n\nQuotes are on 516p/kg (\u20ac6.51/kg inc VAT) for U3 cattle, although 530p/kg (\u20ac6.69/kg) is widely available as a starting price with 4p to 10p/kg more on offer depending on numbers. Good-quality cows are on 420p to 450p/kg (\u20ac5.30 to \u20ac5.68/kg)."

            "article_content": "A technician stands Inside one of the protoDUNE detectors during its construction at CERN. Could the device reveal hidden dimensions of the universe?\n\nFor more than a century, scientists have been fascinated by the possibility that hidden, minuscule spatial dimensions could be influencing the physics of our familiar three-dimensional world. Despite decades of experimental searches, however, there has yet to be concrete evidence of these extra dimensions. Now, a recent study proposes a way to advance this search: using the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to probe these hidden dimensions through neutrino behavior.\n\nNeutrinos are among the universe's most elusive particles, earning them the nickname \" ghost particles .\" There are three known types \u2014 or \"flavors\" \u2014 of neutrinos, each with a mass billions of times smaller than an electron's. These particles are remarkable in their ability to transform \u2014 or oscillate \u2014 into different flavors as they travel through space, even without interacting with other particles.\n\nStudying neutrinos with DUNE\n\nDUNE is a forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiment based in Illinois and South Dakota. \"In this experiment, neutrinos are generated by a particle accelerator at Fermilab [in Illinois], travel a distance of 1,300 kilometers [800 miles], and are observed using a massive underground detector in South Dakota,\" Mehedi Masud , a professor at Chung-Ang University in South Korea and co-author of the study, told Live Science via email.\n\nThe experimental setup is ideal for studying neutrino oscillations. Neutrinos created in Fermilab's collisions \u2014 primarily muon neutrinos (one of the three flavors) \u2014 will traverse Earth to reach the South Dakota detector. Along the way, some of these particles are expected to transform into the other two flavors: electron neutrinos and tau neutrinos.\n\nBy observing how the different flavors evolve during their journey, DUNE scientists hope to unravel several fundamental questions in neutrino physics, such as the hierarchy of neutrino masses, the precise parameters governing oscillation, and the role neutrinos may have played in creating the matter-antimatter imbalance in the universe.\n\nRelated: Our universe is merging with 'baby universes', causing it to expand, new theoretical study suggests\n\nAnother view of the protoDUNE detector during its construction at CERN (Image credit: CERN)\n\nProbing extra dimensions with neutrino oscillations\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of High Energy Physics in November, proposes that the enigmatic behavior of neutrinos could be explained if, in addition to the familiar three dimensions of space, there exist extra spatial dimensions on the scale of micrometers (millionths of a meter). While tiny by everyday standards, such dimensions are remarkably large compared with the femtometer (one-quadrillionth of a meter) scales typical of subatomic particles .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The theory of large extra dimensions, first proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali in 1998, suggests that our familiar three-dimensional space is embedded within a higher-dimensional framework\" of four or more dimensions, Masud explained. \"The primary motivation for this theory is to address why gravity is vastly weaker than the other fundamental forces in nature. Furthermore, the theory of large extra dimensions offers a potential explanation for the origin of the tiny neutrino masses, a phenomenon that remains unexplained within the Standard Model of particle physics .\"\n\nIf extra dimensions exist, they could subtly alter neutrino oscillation probabilities in ways detectable by DUNE, according to the study authors. These distortions could appear as a slight suppression of expected oscillation probabilities and as small oscillatory \"wiggles\" at higher neutrino energies.\n\nSimulating DUNE data to hunt for extra dimensions\n\nIn this study, the authors considered the case of a single additional dimension. The effects of an extra dimension are determined primarily by its size. This dependence creates an opportunity for researchers to investigate the presence of such dimensions by analyzing how neutrinos interact with matter within the detector. The extra dimension influences the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos, which, in turn, can reveal valuable clues about its potential existence and properties.\n\n\"We simulated several years of neutrino data from the DUNE experiment using computational models,\" Masud said. \"By analyzing both the low-energy and high-energy effects of large extra dimensions on neutrino oscillation probabilities, we statistically assessed DUNE's ability to constrain the potential size of these extra dimensions, assuming they exist in nature.\"\n\nThe team's analysis suggests that the DUNE experiment will be capable of detecting an extra dimension if its size is around half a micron (one-millionth of a meter). DUNE is currently under construction and is expected to begin data collection around 2030. After several years of operation, the accumulated data will likely be sufficient for a comprehensive analysis of the theory of large extra dimensions. The team expects the results of this analysis to be available roughly a decade from now.\n\nAdditionally, they think that, in the future, combining data from DUNE with other experimental methods \u2014 such as collider experiments or astrophysical and cosmological observations \u2014 will enhance the ability to investigate the properties of extra dimensions with greater precision and accuracy.\n\n\"In the future, incorporating inputs from other types of data could further tighten these upper bounds, making the discovery of large extra dimensions more plausible, should they exist in nature,\" Masud said. \"Beyond being an exciting avenue for new physics, the potential presence of large extra dimensions could also help DUNE measure standard unknowns in neutrino physics more precisely, free from the influence of unaccounted-for effects.\""

One to buy?\n\nI love special edition smartphones, but they\u2019re quite hard to get right. Some don\u2019t make all that much sense, while others are wonderfully over-the-top yet really niche collaborations.\n\nThankfully, Poco\u2019s Iron Man Edition of its new X7 Pro has absolutely nailed the formula. Announced at CES 2025, I had the chance to see it in person \u2014 and it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA fantastic Iron Man-themed design\n\nPoco could have gone mad with the design, but it has held back (slightly) and created something eye-catching but not too ridiculous. It all centers around a \u201crelief\u201d (a design technique where a flat image appears to be 3D) of Iron Man\u2019s famous helmet on the back of the phone, which is so effective you immediately run your finger across it, expecting to feel it raised above the phone\u2019s otherwise flat rear panel. The design of Iron Man\u2019s Arc Reactor surrounds the helmet relief, and an Avengers logo sits at the bottom of the phone.\n\nThe photos don\u2019t do the colors or design justice, as it\u2019s even more vibrant in person, and I love the combination of finishes from matte to glossy, plus the careful use of gold accents. There\u2019s a case included in the special presentation box \u2014 both are covered in fun nods to the Iron Man character \u2014 which crucially doesn\u2019t cover up the fantastic details on the back of the phone, yet will still provide important corner protection in the event of a fall. It\u2019s great to see an IP68 dust and water resistance rating for the X7 Pro, too.\n\nOn the day the Poco X7 Pro \u2013 Iron Man Edition was announced, I took it to see what someone immersed in the world of comics and collectibles thought of it. Kate Miwk, owner of Miwk Books, not only thought the phone would be a highly prized collectible but also said she would \u201cabsolutely use it,\u201d even after a few moments scrolling through the menus and checking out the Iron Man design. It\u2019s fine for me, a tech journalist, to say it\u2019s cool, but it\u2019s even better when someone who works in the comic and collectible world agrees. It shows that Poco has made something special here.\n\nMediaTek power and more tech\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 3 Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nPoco got the Iron Man Edition\u2019s design right, but what about the technology? The Poco X7 Pro has a MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra processor, a chip announced at the end of December 2024, making it one of the very first phones to use it. It\u2019s equipped with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space and powered by a hefty 6,000mAh battery with Poco\u2019s HyperCharge fast charging to take it from zero to 100% in around 42 minutes.\n\nOn the front is a 6.67-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i over the top, which shows Android 15 and Xiaomi\u2019s HyperOS interface. The software has been given an Iron Man-themed makeover, too, with custom wallpaper and specially designed icons. It\u2019s a typical Poco look, as its popular gaming phones always have a busy, colorful, and highly stylized look to Android.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 3 Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nThere are two cameras on the back: a 50-megapixel Sony IMX882 with optical image stabilization (OIS), along with an 8MP wide-angle camera. On the front is a 20MP selfie camera. Other X7 Pro features include an in-display fingerprint sensor, dual speakers, Bluetooth 5.4, 5G connectivity, and face unlock.\n\nWhat about the Poco X7?\n\nThe Poco X7 range is divided into three different models \u2014 the special X7 Pro \u2013 Iron Man Edition seen here, the normal X7 Pro, and a Poco X7. If you don\u2019t choose the Iron Man Edition, the Poco X7 Pro comes in black, green, or yellow with a black stripe. Plus, there\u2019s the option to buy a version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space.\n\nIf you choose the Poco X7 there are some feature differences between it and the X7 Pro to consider. It has a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra processor plus a 5,110mAh battery and 45W wired fast charging, and although the screen is the same size, it\u2019s curved at the sides and uses Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for protection. Otherwise, it has the same main camera, selfie camera, IP68 rating, and software.\n\nThe Poco X7\u2019s design is noticeably different and not just because of the curved screen, as the Poco logo has an unusual embossed design, and there\u2019s a vegan leather rear panel option too. The phone comes in silver, green, or black with yellow highlights. The Poco X7 starts at $249 and the Poco X7 Pro at $299, with the top 12GB/512GB version priced at $369. The desirable Poco X7 Pro \u2013 Iron Man Edition costs $399. Poco does not sell its phones in the U.S., and has confirmed that sadly, the Iron Man Edition will not be available in the U.K. while we expect other models to be sold there.\n\nOne to buy?\n\nI haven\u2019t spent enough time with the Poco X7 Pro to fully evaluate it yet, but it\u2019s clear the processor makes Poco\u2019s busy software smooth and fast to respond, and the screen is suitably colorful and bright. However, I am so impressed with the Iron Man Edition\u2019s design because it\u2019s not totally insane and instead rather well-judged and sensibly executed.\n\nWill it be the first in a range of Marvel-themed Poco phones where we will one day be able to build our own Avengers team using just special edition models? Whatever happens, the Iron Man Edition is a great start and one of the most desirable special edition smartphones I\u2019ve seen in a while."

            "article_content": "We\u2019re only one week into 2025, but, already, OpenAI is having a tough year. Here is everything that\u2019s gone wrong for the influential company in the last seven days, and a quick look at the potential frustrations and headwinds that it faces as it heads into the new year.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s sister sues him\n\nAnnie Altman, the sister of the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has sued the executive, accusing him of sexual abuse. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri on Monday, makes claims that Altman abused his sister when she was three years old and he was 12. The suit claims that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts of sexual assault,\u201d Annie suffered \u201csevere emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which is expected to continue into the future.\u201d The suit asks for damages in excess of $75,000, as well as a jury trial.\n\nThe allegations of abuse have circulated the web for over a year and first gained mainstream attention in the days after Altman was controversially ousted from OpenAI (he would later be reinstated). The litigation has obviously pushed the claims to a much wider audience. Were the case to head to trial, it could prove disastrous for OpenAI from a PR perspective.\n\nAltman\u2019s family released a statement Wednesday responding to Annie\u2019s litigation. \u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refused conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d The statement, which Altman shared on X, further characterizes Annie as mentally unwell and financially motivated. It states that though the family has financially supported Annie for years and she \u201ccontinues to demand more money\u201d from them.\n\nA former employee\u2019s family accuses the company of murder\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has also been subjected to conspiracy theories that allege it murdered a former employee. The death of Suchir Balaji on November 26th inspired immediate suspicion, despite the fact that the San Francisco Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has dubbed the death a suicide. That\u2019s because, in the months before his death, Balaji acted as a corporate whistleblower, making claims that the company was breaking U.S. copyright law. Only a few weeks before his death, Balaji penned an online essay in which he claimed to show that the company\u2019s approach to content generation did not fall under the U.S. definition of \u201cfair use.\u201d\n\nWhile police have said that there is \u201cno evidence of foul play\u201d in Balaji\u2019s case, his family has claimed that he was murdered by OpenAI and has demanded that the FBI investigate his death. In an interview with The San Francisco Standard, the Balaji family relayed that they \u201cbelieved their son was murdered at the behest of OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a $100 billion industry that\u2019d be turned upside down by his testimony,\u201d said Poornima Ramarao, his mother. \u201cIt could be a group of people involved, a group of companies, a complete nexus.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy hasn\u2019t been made publicly available yet.\n\nThe Cybertruck bomber allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his attack\n\nTo top things off, it was recently learned that the guy who blew himself up in a Cybertruck outside of Trump Tower used ChatGPT to plot the attack. Las Vegas police recently revealed details to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis is the first incident that I\u2019m aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\u201d said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. \u201cIt\u2019s a concerning moment.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly something that OpenAI is going to want to include in its ad copy (\u201cUseful for planning terrorist attacks!\u201d just doesn\u2019t have a great ring to it).\n\nPolitical headwinds\n\nOpenAI doesn\u2019t just face a slew of bizarre, splashy scandals, it also faces the political realities of Trump\u2019s second presidency. Elon Musk, the company\u2019s former founder (and investor) turned worst enemy, notably helped Trump win and is now enjoying unparalleled access to the federal government\u2019s levers of power. At the same time that he\u2019s been dubbed America\u2019s \u201cco-president,\u201d Musk is also waging a legal war on OpenAI that, while having been dubbed \u201cfrivolous\u201d by OpenAI, shows no signs of going anywhere.\n\nThe lawsuit that Musk filed last year alleges that the company has betrayed its original mission in favor of pursuing a for-profit business model (OpenAI did recently announce it would be ditching its original, weird structure to pursue a more traditional business strategy). When last we checked in on that litigation effort last November, Musk had expanded the lawsuit to include other entities close to OpenAI, including its backer, Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, while Musk is engaged in the legal battle, and may be able to manipulate federal policy in ways that could prove disruptive to OpenAI, he can also leverage the soft power of his media platform, X, to damage the company\u2019s reputation. Indeed, Musk and his affiliates have seized on some of OpenAI\u2019s recent controversies, openly spreading damaging conspiracy theories. The Standard notes that, after Suchir Balaji died, Musk and others close to him helped to spread the conspiracy theories surrounding the coder\u2019s death: \u201cWhen Ramarao (Balaji\u2019s mother) tweeted about hiring the private investigator, Musk replied: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nThe fraught economics of OpenAI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s biggest dilemma may be less political than economic. That is, the massive amounts of money that are being used to prop up the company have left many onlookers wondering: Is OpenAI\u2019s business model even sustainable? Last year, the company self-reported that it lost some $5 billion, while garnering substantially less money in revenue. OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will grow to some $11 billion by the end of this year and will continue to explode exponentially in the years to come.\n\nIndeed, OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will reach $100 billion by the year 2029\u2014a mere four years from now. Granted, as a company, OpenAI has grown at breakneck speed (its revenue jumped 1,700 percent in the space of a year, the New York Times has reported), though skeptics still see its projections as PR fantasies designed to draw in perpetual cash infusions from true believers in the venture capital realm. Blogger Ed Zitron, who has referred to OpenAI as an \u201cunsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company,\u201d notes that the company\u2019s own estimations of its future revenue capacity are \u201cfucking ridiculous.\u201d Firmly repping the doubter camp, Zitron writes:\n\n\u2026the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it\u2019s not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.\n\nZitron notes that OpenAI seems to make a majority of its revenue from subscriptions to ChatGPT, which doesn\u2019t seem to be making enough money to make up for its ongoing losses. OpenAI also makes money by licensing usage of its algorithmic models for use in software products. As it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if their revenue increases if the cost of providing service remains so high. Sure, it could jack up prices, but OpenAI has competitors with deep pockets and similar benchmarks.\n\nIn short: OpenAI has its work cut out for it. Beset by powerful adversaries, ongoing lawsuits, and looming scandals that could prove disastrous for the company\u2019s brand, the company needs to prove that the media hype that carried it through the last few years can actually translate into cold hard dollars and cents. It\u2019s unclear, at this point at least, how it\u2019s going to do that."

            "article_content": "Hal Brands is a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. This essay is adapted from his new book, \u201cThe Eurasian Century: Hot Wars, Cold Wars, and the Making of the Modern World.\u201d\n\nThe most dangerous geopolitical phenomenon of our era isn\u2019t any single crisis, conflict or competitor. It is the growing web of ties that bind America\u2019s Eurasian foes.\n\nEurasia \u2014 the supercontinent encompassing Europe, Asia and their outlying islands \u2014 is the world\u2019s strategic center, where most of its people and economic potential reside. An empire that ruled Eurasia could project its influence across the adjoining oceans and around the world.\n\nAll the epic clashes of the 20th century \u2014 World War I, World War II, the Cold War \u2014 were contests between autocracies seeking vast Eurasian empires and the global coalitions that fought to turn them back. Today, a new league of authoritarian leaders is reviving this deadly pattern. Revisionist \u2014 that is to say, violently dissatisfied \u2014 powers are locking arms and thrusting the world into the next round of the great Eurasian struggle that has shaped the modern age. Unfortunately, the United States is not ready for the challenge.\n\nThe history of the modern era was foretold when it was just beginning. In 1904, British scholar Halford Mackinder explained in a landmark lecture how geography, technology and ideology were combining to ignite an explosive Eurasian century.\n\nHe argued that the proliferation of railroads was shrinking Eurasia, allowing ambitious states to shuttle huge armies across the landmass. The end of the easy colonial expansion of the 19th century was turning the great powers against one another in the 20th. Politics and geopolitics were also interacting combustively: Tyrants now ruled modern industrial economies, which would turbo-charge repression and conquest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll these developments, Mackinder foresaw, would lead to titanic battles. A country or coalition that mastered Eurasia would become a global menace, for it would possess the power to make even the most distant democracies insecure. So, aspiring conquerors would lunge for Eurasian hegemony, while offshore powers \u2014 and the vulnerable states situated along Eurasia\u2019s edges \u2014 would fight to preserve their freedoms by keeping the supercontinent divided.\n\nThis was as good a guide as any to what followed. In World War I, a militaristic, illiberal Germany sought to dominate Europe from the North Sea to the Caucasus, creating a resource-rich empire and a springboard to global power. It took a transoceanic coalition anchored by Britain and the United States to beat the Germans back. In World War II, the fascist powers racked up victories from the Atlantic coast of France to the Central Pacific. An even grander coalition \u2014 the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China \u2014 was required to rescue humanity from a new dark age. During the Cold War, a communist bloc led by Moscow dominated the heart of Eurasia and sought to press outward against a free world led by Washington.\n\nThese contests claimed tens of millions of lives, showing how aggression and atrocity could radiate outward from conquered continents. They also demonstrated that the cycle of Eurasian conflict could be broken only by the United States.\n\nThis distant superpower helped defeat two wartime bids for Eurasian hegemony. During the Cold War, it preserved a favorable balance within the supercontinent by erecting the alliances \u2014 NATO and several security pacts in the Western Pacific \u2014 that secured its economically dynamic flanks. These partnerships enabled democracy to thrive and the free-world economy to flourish, and they formed the foundation upon which the liberal world order was built. By the 1990s, the Western victory over the Soviet Union had inaugurated a post-Cold War era of great-power peace and democratic dominance. But dreams of autocratic empire are now reviving, and a second Eurasian century has begun.\n\nIn Northeast Asia, North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is building up his nuclear and missile arsenals in hopes of driving America from the Korean Peninsula. In the Middle East, Iran and its proxies are fighting the United States and Israel over the region\u2019s future. In Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin is waging a quasi-genocidal war to rebuild the Russian empire \u2014 with an assist from North Korean troops. China is racing to prepare for war with Washington and making its push for primacy in the Western Pacific.\n\nEach of these countries aims to overturn the existing order in key regions around the Eurasian periphery. Each sees U.S. power and liberal values as its greatest foes. And what makes the current moment so precarious is that these aggressive powers are making common cause.\n\nChina and Russia announced their \u201cno limits\u201d strategic partnership just before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They mean, in Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s words, to revolutionize the international system by causing \u201cchanges the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen for 100 years.\u201d Since that invasion, Russia and North Korea have sealed a formal military alliance; Russia and Iran have built a stronger defense partnership in which technology, weapons and know-how flow both ways. And since Oct. 7, 2023, Russia has provided targeting data and other assistance to the Houthis in Yemen, who have also acquired missiles and other means of mayhem from Tehran. Most of these relationships aren\u2019t new, but all have grown rapidly in the hothouse global environment created by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nTo be sure, there is no overarching multilateral alliance \u2014 no autocrats\u2019 NATO. Mistrust among the illiberal powers remains pervasive. But their relationships constitute a cohering network of ties among states that are determined to wreck Pax Americana and command some of the most valuable strategic real estate on Earth. Western observers play down the autocrats\u2019 pacts at their peril, because some of history\u2019s greatest cataclysms have been caused by dysfunctional \u2014 yet profoundly destructive \u2014 alliances.\n\nNazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan never could have coexisted in the long run. But before World War II, their cooperation delivered devastating multiplier effects by destabilizing governments on several fronts at once. During the early Cold War, a wary alliance between Moscow and Beijing intensified the threats facing the free world. And whether the new autocratic pacts are love matches or marriages of convenience, they are having serious strategic effects.\n\nFor one thing, these relationships encourage aggression by reducing its costs: A heavily sanctioned Russia has been able to continue its war in Ukraine thanks to the missiles, artillery shells, drones and troops it has received from Tehran and Pyongyang, and the economic succor it has gotten from Beijing. Likewise, the pacts increase the danger of war on some fronts by pacifying others: Putin can go all-out against Ukraine because he faces no threat from China, just as Xi can be bolder in the Pacific because he has a friendly Russia at his back. An autocratic peace within Eurasia encourages violent meddling around its margins.\n\nAutocratic relationships also weaken Western pressure on individual regimes: Russia now shields Pyongyang from sanctions, while Tehran and Moscow develop illicit trade networks beyond U.S. reach. These relationships divide U.S. attention by creating trouble in several places at once. Witness Washington\u2019s agonizing debates over aid for Ukraine vs. support for Taiwan, over hammering the Houthis vs. husbanding missiles for a war with China. Perhaps most fundamentally, autocratic ties are shifting the military balance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing\u2019s record-breaking buildup has long involved purchases of Russian planes, missiles and air defenses. And Sino-Russian defense cooperation is only getting deeper and more secretive as the two countries work together to build submarines, helicopters and other key capabilities.\n\nAcross Eurasia, in fact, transnational production networks are emerging: Iranian-origin drones are being built in Russian defense plants, where North Korean workers reportedly labor. The autocratic arms trade is burgeoning, as Russia promises to sell state-of-the-art aircraft, air defenses and other advanced capabilities to its partners. Disruptive military innovation is accelerating, as North Korea receives Russian technology and know-how for its missile and satellite programs. These countries\u2019 militaries are also learning from one another: Iran\u2019s missile and drone attack against Israel in April looked suspiciously similar to Russia\u2019s previous strikes against Ukraine.\n\nIf the United States once served as the arsenal of democracy, a modern-day arsenal of autocracy is now taking shape. Russia, Iran, China and North Korea have already managed more defense-technological collaboration than the Axis powers of the World War II era ever did. Even if they never come together in a full-fledged military alliance, they could still deepen their cooperation in dangerous ways.\n\nFor example, they could collaborate on more sensitive projects: Russia could support North Korea\u2019s rapidly improving nuclear program or give Beijing its most advanced submarine-quieting technology. Putin could give the Houthis anti-ship cruise missiles to make their attacks more lethal. Russia and China could swap insights on how to use nuclear threats to keep the United States from interfering as they coerce or attack their neighbors \u2014 precisely what Putin has done in Ukraine. Or perhaps these countries could find more dramatic ways to cooperate in crisis or conflict.\n\nChina and Russia are already conducting military drills in potential conflict zones from the Baltic Sea to the Western Pacific, signaling that one illiberal power won\u2019t sit on the sidelines as Washington fights another. Russia could aid China in a future conflict against the United States by conducting cyberattacks that make it harder for America to mobilize. Or Putin could menace Europe by posturing his forces there while the Pentagon is preoccupied with a crisis in Asia. If any of this seems unlikely, just remember that Western observers have repeatedly been surprised, even shocked, by how far these relationships have already come.\n\nMeanwhile, closer ties among U.S. adversaries raise the odds that a war that starts in one place will spill into others. Recall that World War II began not as a global conflict but as a set of regional crises that gradually intensified and became inseparable \u2014 just as the United States\u2019 Eurasian crises are becoming sharper, and more interwoven, today.\n\nThe United States is still struggling to adapt to this situation. Washington continues to see the world as being divided into separate regions. This assumption is dangerously outdated.\n\nAs the Eurasian axis coheres, individual crises take on global meaning. It might be fashionable to talk about pivoting away from Europe to focus on China. But one reason it would be so damaging if America abandons Ukraine, and Russia defeats it, is that this would be a victory for the larger autocratic coalition in its showdown with the democratic world.\n\nThe United States also lacks the resources for this new round of rivalry. The U.S. military is designed to defeat only a single enemy in a major conflict. U.S. military spending is nearly as low, as a percentage of gross domestic product, as it has been at any time since World War II. Its defense industrial base is in pitiful shape. Yet as hot wars rage in the Middle East and Europe, and a Sino-American cold war intensifies in the Asia-Pacific, the United States could easily face conflicts in two or more regions simultaneously \u2014 or find itself fighting a rival that is receiving help from other adversaries. The United States has a post-Cold War military in a pre-world war world. It should be devoting about 5 percent of GDP to defense \u2014 significantly more than its current 3 percent. It will also need greater cooperation within and across its own Eurasian alliances, so it can exert global strength against interconnected threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of this is already happening. Asia-Pacific powers such as Japan and South Korea have aided Ukraine, because they see its war with Russia as a test of strength between the democratic world and Eurasian autocracies. Now, Washington\u2019s European allies need to get serious about how they would respond \u2014 with sanctions or other measures \u2014 to a Chinese attack against Taiwan, or how they might defend themselves if they were threatened by Russia while the United States is distracted in the Pacific. U.S. allies in Europe and Asia must also significantly boost their military spending, and deepen their defense-industrial integration, to ensure they can produce key weapons at the scale modern war demands.\n\nFinally, America and its allies should take the fight to the enemy. They should pursue stronger, more rigorously enforced economic and technological denial policies \u2014 such as harsher sanctions on Russian and Iranian oil exports, and tighter restraints on China\u2019s semiconductor ecosystem \u2014 meant to hinder autocratic military innovation. And if Washington can make one autocracy pay for the actions of others \u2014 by sanctioning Chinese banks that finance the trade that sustains Putin\u2019s war effort, for instance \u2014 so much the better."

They litter the Old Testament and the New; once you start seeing them, you can\u2019t stop.\n\nA modern example of a short chiasm would be If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Jesus makes a pithy chiastic statement in Mark 2:27: \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nBut most chiastic structures are longer than one line, sometimes stretching across entire chapters, with a hinge point in the middle. Westerners are accustomed to a conclusion landing at the end, like the moral of the story or the punchline of a joke, but the ancient Near Eastern mind liked to embed the main idea dead center.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognize this structure as we read Scripture, from the Psalms to the words of Jesus, we risk placing the emphasis on the wrong point. As a Bible teacher, I see how chiasms honor the truism that repetition is the mother of learning. Chiasms are memory aids, God\u2019s kindness to past generations of worshipers who likely never held Scripture in their hands as well as to modern Christians in our distracted age. They are meant to help us remember.\n\nModern readers may wonder why this particular form of parallelism appealed so heavily to the ancient Near Eastern mind. I certainly did\u2014that is, until my mother died.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to take me to this appointment.\u201d I looked over at my diminutive 79-year-old mother, perched in the passenger seat, eyes apologetic, fretting with her purse.\n\nLike many in her generation, my mom found it difficult to accept even help that was easy to supply. \u201cYou are a person to love, not a problem to solve\u201d had become my mantra to her each time she expressed dismay at having interrupted my life in any way.\n\nBefore you begin to assume that my mother and I had an enviable relationship, let me say we did not\u2014but through much hard work, we found a real sweetness together in her final years. In December of 2021, her kids and grandkids moved her into an apartment five minutes from my home. We set up her antique furniture, hung her favorite pictures, and put out her favorite vase, the one with wisteria around the rim. I was excited to be able to drop in or run errands for her so easily.\n\nI planned a family dinner for her 80th birthday that January. Three days before it, she texted that she had a stomach bug and wasn\u2019t sure she would make it. She assured me she was fine. Please don\u2019t come over. But she was sicker than she thought.\n\nHer birthday passed in the ICU, and a week later she was placed on palliative care, coming home to my house for hospice. No more beeping monitors and sterile overhead lights. No more masks and visitor restrictions. Instead, a room flooded with sunshine, warm with color, and filled with loved ones.\n\nShe was, at this point, no longer communicative. But I knew if she could have spoken, she would have repeated the words she had strained to say again and again during her brief hospital stay: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be a burden.\u201d\n\nMy brothers and I took our place at her bedside to keep a vigil familiar to many reading this. We listened as her breathing became more and more labored with each passing day. We witnessed the hard work of dying.\n\nOn the second day, the hospice nurse told me, \u201cYou know, you can coach her. Give her encouragement. Tell her she\u2019s doing well.\u201d I played her favorite hymns. I held her hand. I helped keep her clean and comfortable. I whispered a thousand times, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. You\u2019re a person to love, not a problem to solve.\u201d\n\nAt last, she reached the end of her travail. A final deep exhale, a crashing silence.\n\nAnd it hit me: the marvelous and terrible symmetry of a long human life.\n\nEighty years earlier, hadn\u2019t she entered this world in a similar way\u2014through a great labor, with a deep inhale and a piercing wail? Had she not received much the same care in the hours after her birth that we provided in the hours before her death?\n\nI suspect the reason the ancients loved a chiasm was because it is the recognizable shape of the sweep of life. Perhaps God, in his kindness, designed it to be such. Bookends. Repetition. Symmetry.\n\nI reasoned that the other concentric layers of a human life could be mapped as well. Every human life is unique, but what might be the general pattern? I sketched out my thoughts.\n\nThe chiasm of a human life. The idea is not unique to me. I recall the saying that we are first children to our parents, then parents to our children, then parents to our parents, and finally children to our children.\n\nIf life is a chiasm, and if chiasms teach, what does the chiasm of life seek to teach us? If we become students of it, I believe it can \u201cteach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Ps. 90:12).\n\nRemembering that seasons of life follow a patterned order helps us inhabit the season we are in and prioritize how to use the time we are given. Since death announced its presence in Genesis 3, our days have been numbered. Perhaps God, in his infinite kindness, gave us a chiasm, a patterned measuring rod, to number those days rightly.\n\nKnowing that aging means the relinquishing of freedoms and abilities helps us embrace that process rather than hold onto self-reliance. It helps us to anticipate the next season, to savor the one we are in, and to be grateful for the ones we have already left behind.\n\nRecognizing that in some seasons we give care and in some we receive care helps us accept care when it\u2019s our turn to receive. We are not problems to solve in our extreme age any more than we were in our infancy. We are simply people to love, in a stage when others repay a debt of care they themselves received in their time.\n\nThe chiastic structure of life explains why we feel such shock when a life is cut short. We expect intuitively that human life should make a full arc. The asymmetry of a young or untimely death creates dissonance. No bookend. No parallel. No full circle. My mother\u2019s death was a good one by many measures, not least because of its blessed symmetry.\n\nBut if a chiasm puts the main point at the middle, how are our middle years noteworthy? Midlife offers a unique opportunity, a moment of perspective at the crossroads. If we have paid close attention to how we entered the chiasm, we will be better able to exit it with grace and submission. Looking back over the first half of life can help us anticipate the second half\u2014in both its losses and its gains.\n\nIf we focus just on our abilities and responsibilities, we see only gains in the first half of the chiasm of life and only parallel losses in the second. In a culture that values youth and vigor, we risk losing sight of what we learn over the years: wisdom. The wisdom of aging means that even as our bodies increasingly fail us, our internal lives grow richer and steadier. Bodies decline, but people develop.\n\nAt 55, I can already track the decline in my physical abilities. I am still in a stage where I am the supplier of help to others, but if the Lord grants me length of years, I will one day be only a recipient\u2014fed and clothed and cared for by someone else\u2019s hands and feet.\n\nThe days in which my body can yield help to others are numbered, and I want to number them rightly. My parents have helped me with the math. Watching them pass into old age has brought into focus for me the preciousness of the years I have left. My earliest caregivers have moved to receiving care. Their physical abilities grow more limited, but their insights are deepening.\n\nThey are the evidence to me that, while failing joints and heart valves and eyesight and hearing may increasingly unsteady our bodies, wisdom increasingly steadies our souls. Bodies decline, people develop. The lamp of wisdom burns brighter as the oil of life experience grows in supply.\n\nFor the believer, old age is an invitation toward burgeoning luminosity.\n\nIn my attic is a relic of days gone by: a cassette player my husband owned as a teen. In the living room is another relic\u2014the vase with wisteria trim. My mother\u2019s, passed on to me. It\u2019s not of enormous value, but unlike its electronic upstairs neighbor, its value is steadily growing with age.\n\nHere is where we bump into the problem with the way our culture views not just aging but also the elderly. My husband, Jeff, and I are affectionately called \u201cthe Olds\u201d by our kids, who thankfully still seek our advice and who regard us as a source of wisdom obtained through length of years. But our children are increasingly the exception.\n\nSo many cultural shifts have happened in so little time that many parents and children are estranged by their differing views. Whereas one\u2019s elders used to be seen as those increasing in wisdom with every passing year, they are now likely to be seen as increasingly obsolete (\u201cOkay, boomer\u201d). Less like a vase, more like a cassette player.\n\nWhen I listen to my 84-year-old father\u2019s advice, it occurs to me that he always waits patiently for me to end my question before responding. At 55, I often sit with a younger person to hear about their difficulty in marriage, parenting, or ministry; recognize a familiar pattern a few minutes into the telling; and, at the right moment, offer the same advice I have given on similar occasions.\n\nWe have a way of hitting the same roadblocks. If I have acquired a modest level of wisdom in middle age, how much more does my father hold at 84? There is godly wisdom, a gift God grants, but there is also the wisdom of age\u2014gained by sheer length of years and attention to those around us.\n\nThe wisdom of age is the basis for the fifth commandment\u2019s requirement to honor father and mother, a command given not to children, as we often assume, but to adults. (Note that the commands following it deal with the very adult sins of murder, adultery, theft, bearing false witness, and covetousness.)\n\nThe fifth commandment is intended to instruct adult children to show honor to elderly parents. The Puritans interpret correctly its greater implications in the Westminster Catechism, noting that it included showing honor to all who are our superiors in age and experience.\n\nPut succinctly: Honor the Olds. They know some things you don\u2019t. Their bodies are declining, but their personhood is ever developing. We can miss this so easily. I once heard a woman in her 30s gently reminding an audience of younger women that \u201colder Christian women are still valuable in the church.\u201d In accordance with the fifth commandment, I would offer a slightly altered wording. Those older than us are not still valuable. They are, rather, increasingly valuable.\n\nIn a culture that fetishizes youth and views aging as a journey into irrelevance and uselessness, God\u2019s family takes the view that people possess an ever-developing value, one that renders their contributions essential and indispensable.\n\nOur elders have much to offer us\u2014until they reach the stage in the chiasm of life when they don\u2019t. At some point, old age will take from them even the ability to think or communicate. And yet, they will still teach us. Aging requires a fortitude like nothing else. Caring for the aged grants unforeseen blessings to the younger generation. Those who hold the hand of the dying learn secrets to make them wise. They learn that the elderly are not an obligation but a sacred trust. My mother was luminous in her dying.\n\nThe grand symmetry of the human life can yield wisdom if we give it our attention. We move from the helplessness of birth to seasons of growth and possibility under the watchful care of our parents. We become caregivers to our children, then to our parents. We watch growth and possibility turn to decline and limited ability in our own lives. We return to helplessness. And we leave this life much as we entered. How kind of the Lord to give us a roadmap for aging until our last enemy, death, is defeated.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lie that the first half of life is to be clung to. When we behold the arc from beginning to end, we learn to value all of it. We learn not just to number our days but to cherish them\u2014the days of our youth, the days of our twilight, and all the days in between.\n\nDon\u2019t let a youth-obsessed culture rob you of your sense of the value of all parts of life. We need our aging faces and slowing bodies to tell us the truth: that time is passing, and that it is exceedingly precious. Each season yields its own exquisite fruit. No need to cling to what was never meant to last. God is faithful in every season.\n\nJen Wilkin is an author, Bible teacher, and cohost of the Knowing Faith podcast."

Timing's everything.\"\n\nStar of Netflix\u2019s new series No Good Deed, the actor didn\u2019t reveal just what Perry\u2019s note said but the anecdote did seem to move Barrymore.\n\nKudrow had previously admitted to long refusing to watch reruns of Friends as she didn\u2019t want to risk not liking her work on the show.\n\nBut in an effort to keep the memory of Perry alive, she said she\u2019d been watching episodes back.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t able to watch it because it\u2019s too embarrassing to watch yourself. But if I make it about Matthew, then that\u2019s OK,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s just celebrating how hilarious he was \u2014 and that is what I want to remember [about him].\u201d\n\nShe describes him as being 'uniquely hilarious'. (Jason Kempin/Getty Images)\n\nWatching Friends back had Kudrow \u2018laughing out loud\u2019 as she praised her co-stars.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cI\u2019m blown away by Courteney Cox. I\u2019m blown away by Jen. Matthew, obviously, is just uniquely hilarious. No one ever knew that cadence or comedic rhythm before him. Matt LeBlanc is hilarious. And David Schwimmer, too. Sometimes I even laugh at what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she admitted.\n\nFollowing the collective tribute from the cast, Kudrow later released a personal tribute on Instagram.\n\n\u201cShot the pilot, Friends Like Us, got picked up then immediately, we were at the NBC Upfronts. Then\u2026 You suggested we play poker AND made it so much fun while we initially bonded. Thank you for that,\u201d the star wrote.\n\n\u201cThank you for making me laugh so hard at something you said, that my muscles ached, and tears poured down my face EVERY DAY. Thank you for your open heart in a six way relationship that required compromise. And a lot of \u2018talking\u2019.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThank you for showing up at work when you weren\u2019t well and then, being completely brilliant. Thank you for the best 10 years a person gets to have. Thank you for trusting me.\n\n\u201cThank you for all I learned about GRACE and LOVE through knowing you. Thank you for the time I got to have with you, Matthew.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Artificial General Intelligence aims to replicate human-like reasoning, creativity, and decision-making across diverse tasks. It is AI's next frontier, which will revolutionize health, education, and more but raises ethical concerns, demanding careful regulation.\n\nThe Artificial General Intelligence or AGI is the future step in artificial intelligence research. It is often labeled as the \u2018holy grail\u2019 in AI research, which implies that machines have the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that can be done by a human but only better.\n\nAGI systems can emulate human-like reasoning, problem-solving abilities, ability to differentiate between cause, effect, and decision-making in an extremely wide set of fields. These include creativity, emotional understanding, and even moral judgment.\n\nIn simple terms, AGI aims to work like a human brain\u2014it can handle new tasks, learn from experiences, and use what it knows in different and creative ways. For decades, this has been confined to science fiction, but rapid advancement in AI is bringing AGI closer to reality.\n\nHow AGI Differs From AI\n\nThe difference lies in their scope, capabilities, and implications. The Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), aka AI, focuses on specific areas, such as image recognition, translation, natural language processing, and specific target-oriented tasks.\n\nAGI seeks to achieve human-like versatility in the areas of cognition. The AI is trained to gain specific task results, whereas AGI systems don\u2019t require task-specific training. AGI possesses the cognitive flexibility to learn and adapt in real time, similar to humans. It can solve problems using its reasoning.\n\nPotential To Revolutionize All Sectors\n\nAGI can change the health, education, and climate science industries. In the health sector, AGI can be used to come up with cures for diseases and improve diagnostics. In education, AGI could give personalized learning experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, its capacity to simulate complex systems can assist in solving world problems such as climate change, poverty, and political conflicts. But experts warn that it is just half the problem: managing the societal impact is just as important.\n\nAI technologies such as GPT and large language models are impressive but far from general intelligence. They lack human-level independent reasoning, transfer of knowledge between domains, and contextuality beyond the given parameters. On the other hand, AGI can do wonders.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers face challenges to replicate human consciousness, ethical safeguards, and creating systems that can reason without bias.\n\nSkepticism About AGI\n\nThe potential for AGI poses major ethical concerns. If this becomes a reality, it might surpass human intelligence, which means it can take decisions without human interventions. It might become so independent that humans could lose control. In an interview, great scientist Stephen Hawking said, \u201cThe development of artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\u201d\n\nAccording to researchers, it is imperative that AGI can trigger mass layoff or misuse by malicious actors. Tech leaders in AI, including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, have also suggested strict regulation and collaboration in AGI.\n\nAGI And Human Intervention\n\nInstead of replacing humans, AGI is expected to be a collaborator. Strong policies and international cooperation must be implemented for the smooth incorporation of AGI into everyday life without disrupting social norms.\n\nALSO READ | Samsung Galaxy S25 Series: Pre-Orders Begin January 24, 2025 \u2014 Key Features And Offers Revealed"
