        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: AARO/DOD\n\nIt's never aliens.\n\nAt least, it hasn't been yet. The United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard testimony on Tuesday (Nov. 19) from Jon T. Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The U.S. Department of Defense created the office in July 2022 in order to have a single place for military and government personnel to report UFO sightings, or UAP, as they're now known. The new term, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena, encompasses not only unidentified objects or events in the sky, but also those in water, in space or those that appear to travel between these domains.\n\nDuring today's hearing, Kosloski came in strong, stating that \"it is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.\" Still, despite having resolved hundreds of cases with prosaic explanations, Kosloski noted that his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. \"We do have some very anomalous objects,\" he said.\n\na blurry black dot flying above a snow-covered volcano in grainy black-and-white footage\n\nKosloski also reported on the office's latest analysis of UFO/UAP cases, stressing that his office will \"continue to follow the science and data wherever they lead\" and keep both Congress and the public as informed as possible \u2014 at the unclassified level, he clarified.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to testimony presented to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last week, in which a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer told lawmakers that the American government is part of a decades-long coverup to conceal the fact that \"we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Kosloski gave an overview of his office's activities since it issued a report to Congress and testified in a similar setting last year. \"Many reports resolve to commonplace objects like birds, balloons and unmanned systems, while others lack sufficient data for comprehensive analysis,\" Kosloski said, adding that \"only a small percentage of reports received by AARO are potentially anomalous.\"\n\nKosloski referred to a UAP incident that occurred in 2013 near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The infrared video, shot in 2013 by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol helicopter, appears to show an object flying just above the ocean before disappearing into it, or perhaps splitting in two.\n\n\"We assessed that it was actually flying over the airport the entire time,\" Kosloski said. When the object appears to disappear in the infrared video that accompanies the case, it is actually the camera sensing that the object is the same temperature as the water behind it. Instead of splitting in two, it was simply two objects \u2014 balloons or sky lanterns \u2014 in close proximity that came in and out of view.\n\nKosloski also offered how his office was able to close the case on the infamous GOFAST video, shot by a U.S. Navy fighter jet in 2016 off the coast of Florida. In that case, the object's apparent speed in the video was actually due to the parallax effect, or the camera's perspective, Kosloski explained.\n\nFurthermore, the AARO director showed a 2018 video captured by a drone flying over Mt. Etna that he stated is not widely known among the public. \"This was a rather difficult case to solve,\" Kosloski said. \"The object was actually 170 meters away from the plume \u2014 not flying through it.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) asked Kosloski about whether or not some individuals who have encountered UAP might be reluctant to engage with his office, referring to accusations some UAP disclosure advocates frequently level against AARO. These critics attest that the office is part of an alleged decades-long U.S. government-led campaign of \"excessive secrecy\" that aims to keep the public in the dark about UFOs.\n\nIn response to Gillibrand's questioning, Kosloski defended his office. \"Congress has gone out of its way to create the organization AARO specifically to conduct these sorts of investigations, and has uniquely empowered them to have access to all UAP related information, whether that's historic or current, and we take that responsibility and those authorities very seriously,\" he said.\n\nGillibrand also asked about a report released by AARO in March 2024, noting that she has been told \"it doesn't show any any evidence of secret programs that have aliens.\"\n\nBut Gillibrand pushed back on that assertion. \"That's not how I read the report,\" the senator said. \"What I read in the report is the US government took sightings extremely seriously over the last 75 years, and put some of the greatest minds together to analyze these cases, because they assessed them as some deeply unknown phenomena that may or may not cause threats \u2014 that may or may not be related to adversaries.\"\n\na grainy black orb above the ocean in a black-and-white video\n\nAARO released a report to accompany today's hearing earlier this week. The report, titled, \"All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office\u2019s Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\" examines UAP cases dated between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as historical incidents that were not included in previous reports.\n\nBut, like in its other reports, AARO found no smoking gun for alien visitation this year. \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report notes. Out of the 485 cases that are well within the report's timeframe, 118 were solved and another 174 were slated to be closed, pending a final review.\n\nStill, AARO's 2024 report says that many cases remain unsolved, and that the office continues to study them. However, AARO\u2019s ability to resolve cases \"remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,\" according to the report, meaning there just isn't enough data to conclusively solve cases that lack detailed or multi-sensor observations. In some cases, all there might be to analyze is a single photograph, a few seconds of grainy video or an aviator's written report. Many UAP sightings happen in the blink of an eye as an unknown object zooms past a moving aircraft, for example, so there often isn't enough time to gather photographic or video evidence.\n\nIn other cases, the capabilities of the sensors or platforms involved in the UAP sightings are themselves classified (sometimes, even their existence isn't publicly known), so AARO is unable to discuss them in unclassified reports.\n\nThough overall, according to the 2024 report, there is enough data for AARO to state that it has has \"no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Pentagon UFO office finds 'no empirical evidence' for alien technology in new report\n\n\u2014 Pentagon has 'no credible evidence' of aliens or UFOs that defy physics\n\n\u2014 UFO whistleblowers tell Congress 'we are not alone in the cosmos' (video)\n\nToday's hearing echoed a previous hearing held last year on April 19, 2023. During that hearing, AARO's previous director Sean Kirkpatrick told the Senate Armed Services Committee that his office has seen \"no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics.\"\n\nSimilarly, the report released by AARO in March 2024 that examined historical UFO cases found \"no evidence that any USG [U.S. government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\"\n\nAARO's previous report, released in 2022, examined 510 contemporary UAP reports gathered from government agencies and branches of the United States military. The report found that, while most cases were able to be resolved, 171 remained a mystery.\n\n\"Some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis,\" AARO's 2022 report states.\n\nToday's hearing concluded with a discussion of recent incidents in which unidentified drones, or uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), were seen over U.S. military bases and other sensitive installations. Those incidents, Kosloski notes, underscore the need for the United States to have \"more persistent monitoring and understand that, whether it is a UAP or a counter-UAS issue, that we need to have that complete domain awareness around our national security facilities.\""

        "article_content": "In a recent Senate testimony, Jon T. Kosloski, Director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), clarified the office's stance on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and their ongoing investigations. Speaking to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities on November 19, Kosloski emphasised that AARO has yet to uncover verifiable evidence supporting extraterrestrial life, technology, or activity despite numerous unexplained sightings reported by military personnel. He stressed that his office investigates each sighting scientifically and transparently, addressing all domains \u2013 including sea, sky, and space.\n\nUAP Cases: Mostly Explained, Some Remain Unresolved\n\nAARO was established in 2022 to centralise UAP reports, allowing streamlined assessment of anomalous sightings by government and military entities. While most cases have been attributed to known objects like birds, drones, and balloons, Kosloski mentioned that a minority of incidents remain unexplained, as per a Space.com report.\n\nIn his testimony, he reportedly reviewed examples, such as a 2013 UAP sighting in Puerto Rico that appeared to vanish into the ocean. AARO's investigation concluded it was an optical illusion caused by the camera's inability to differentiate the object's temperature from its surroundings.\n\nPublic Pressure for Transparency\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand queried whether AARO's methods might deter individuals from reporting UAP incidents due to perceptions of governmental secrecy. Kosloski countered by asserting that AARO is uniquely empowered to access historical and current UAP data, with a mandate for transparency in reporting to Congress. In the session, it was noted that some classified data restrictions still apply, particularly regarding sensitive sensor technology, limiting the office's public disclosures.\n\nAARO's 2024 report outlined 485 UAP cases, of which 118 have been solved, and 174 are under final review. While the office has encountered challenges in securing complete sensor data for some incidents, Kosloski assured that no evidence points to UAP activity linked to foreign adversaries."

        "article_content": "H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company\u2019s five co-founders left over \u201coperational and business disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut the company has kept swimming, and today it\u2019s announcing its first product: Runner H, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation. It\u2019s built atop the startup\u2019s own, proprietary \u201ccompact\u201d LLM based on just 2 billion parameters.\n\nH has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. CEO Charles Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents \u201coff the shelf\u201d that have been pre-built by H, as well as for developers to create their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how these services work.\n\nInitially, using those APIs will be free, and later there will be a payment model introduced.\n\nEven using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A to build what Kantor describes as part of the second era of AI \u2014 with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cBut this second era will be as capital intensive as the first one.\u201d\n\n(Recall the $230 million H has already raised \u2014 it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year \u2014 was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner, and Xavier Niel; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung, and UiPath.)\n\nKantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance, and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product.\n\n\u201cEverything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,\u201d he said.\n\nRunner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing.\n\nRPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform \u2014 such as reading forms, checking boxes, and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites, and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources.\n\nQuality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the \u201cmaintenance burdens\u201d around website testing \u2014 validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods \u2014 in particular when modifications have been made.\n\nBPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more.\n\nThere has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.) But Runner H is taking a very different approach with just 2 billion parameters, both for its LLM and for its computer-vision-based \u201cVLM.\u201d Kantor\u2019s argument is that this makes them significantly more efficient in terms of cost and operations, key when working on winning and keeping business deals, and H\u2019s own operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe are specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building for the agentic era.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims that it works: It says that its compact model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s \u201cComputer Use\u201d by 29% (based on WebVoyager benchmarks) as well as models from Mistral and Meta.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Its profile, called @Nvidia_AI_PC, is dedicated to RTX AI PCs and seems to be promoting AI for the average user. Its bio says, \u201cNvidia Powers the World\u2019s AI. And Yours with RTX AI PCs,\u201d and the first pinned post says, \u201cWhether you are deep into AI or just a little curious, we\u2019re here to explore the power of AI on your local PC.\u201d\n\nThe social media profile will deliver the latest news, tech, and AI inspiration from Team Green, with the aim of promoting AI tech on consumer devices. This is particularly important as it seems that most users still haven\u2019t figured out AI, with the majority buying an AI PC not because of its AI capabilities but because it\u2019s the only available option in 2024. And although Nvidia is the leading manufacturer of AI tech in the data center and enterprise world, it probably faces its fiercest competition in the consumer space, with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and even Apple all producing processors with built-in NPUs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe company has previously criticized AI PCs, saying that their performance is only good for basic AI workloads and that its GPUs offer better performance, achieving 100 to more than 1,300 TOPS, depending on the model. Furthermore, we\u2019ve been hearing news and rumors that Nvidia will soon launch an Arm-based processor in 2025, which was further fueled when the heads of Nvidia, TSMC, MediaTek, and Quanta were spotted having dinner before Computex 2024. Although it\u2019s easy to brush off this event as just industry leaders enjoying some time off, it could also be a cap to an informal agreement where Nvidia produces consumer AI CPUs, especially as these four companies are what you need to produce a laptop from scratch.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s no secret that Nvidia wants to enter the CPU market. It even attempted to buy Arm, the company behind the architecture of Snapdragon X and Apple M chips. Unfortunately, the deal was shot down by several government regulators, including the U.S.\u2019s FTC and the U.K.\u2019s CMA. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, the investment group that owns 90% of Arm, regret that they both did not take the opportunity to merge the two companies about a decade ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to launch the Nvidia AI PC account Twitter/X is one more sign that the company is trying to emulate its success in data center AI in the consumer space. If and when Nvidia launches its own AI CPU, it would add one more competitor in the processor market \u2014 a space that\u2019s increasingly becoming crowded with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all jostling for a bigger slice of the pie."

        "article_content": "Instagram is flooded with hundreds of AI-generated influencers who are stealing videos from real models and adult content creators, giving them AI-generated faces, and monetizing their bodies with links to dating sites, Patreon, OnlyFans competitors, and various AI apps.\n\nThe practice, first reported by 404 Media in April, has since exploded in popularity, showing that Instagram is unable or unwilling to stop the flood of AI-generated content on its platform and protect the human creators on Instagram who say they are now competing with AI content in a way that is impacting their ability to make a living.\n\nAccording to our review of more than 1,000 AI-generated Instagram accounts, Discord channels where the people who make this content share tips and discuss strategy, and several guides that explain how to make money by \u201cAI pimping,\u201d it is now trivially easy to make these accounts and monetize them using an assortment of off-the-shelf AI tools and apps. Some of these apps are hosted on the Apple App and Google Play Stores. Our investigation shows that what was once a niche problem on the platform has industrialized in scale, and it shows what social media may become in the near future: a space where AI-generated content eclipses that of humans.\n\nElaina St James, an adult content creator who promotes her work on Instagram, said she and other adult content creators are now directly competing with these AI rip-off accounts, many of which use photographs and videos stolen from adult content creators and Instagram models. She said that while there may be other changes to Instagram\u2019s algorithm that could have contributed to this, since the explosion of AI-generated influencer accounts on Instagram her \u201creach went down tremendously,\u201d from a typical 1 million to 5 million views a month to not cracking a million in the last 10 months, and sometimes coming in under 500,000 views.\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the reasons my views are going down,\u201d St James told us in an interview. \u201cIt's because I'm competing with something that's unnatural.\u201d\n\nThis article was created in partnership with 404\n\nMedia, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.\n\nAlexios Mantzarlis, the director of the security, trust, and safety initiative at Cornell Tech and formerly principal of trust and safety intelligence at Google, compiled a list of around 900 accounts that 404 Media reviewed in its investigation. Mantzarlis, who stumbled on one of these accounts while casually using Instagram, said he started researching the AI-generated influencer accounts because it might show us where AI-generated content is taking social media and the internet more broadly, where he sees a \u201ca rising blended unreality.\u201d Mantzarlis believes he could have easily found 900 more accounts and that the only reason he didn\u2019t get more is that Instagram restricted the account he used to scrape the platform.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a possible sign of what social media is going to look like in five years,\u201d Mantzarlis said in an interview. \u201cBecause this may be coming to other parts of the internet, not just the attractive-people niche on Instagram. This is probably a sign that it's going to be pretty bad.\u201d\n\nThe Accounts\n\nOut of more than 1,000 AI-generated Instagram influencer accounts we reviewed, 100 included at least some deepfake content which took existing videos, usually from models and adult entertainment performers, and replaced their face with an AI-generated face to make those videos seem like new, original content consistent with the other AI-generated images and videos shared by the AI-generated influencer. The other 900 accounts shared images that in some cases were trained on real photographs and in some cases made to look like celebrities, but were entirely AI-generated, not edited photographs or videos.\n\nOut of those 100 accounts that shared deepfake or face-swapped videos, 60 self-identify as being AI-generated, writing in their bios that they are a \u201cvirtual model & influencer\u201d or stating \u201call photos crafted with AI and apps.\u201d The other 40 do not include any disclaimer stating that they are AI-generated.\n\nOne of the bigger accounts in the latter category is \u201cChloe Johnson,\u201d who has a verified account on Instagram and 171,000 followers. This account was deleted by Meta within the past few weeks."

        "article_content": "Donald Trump has chosen TV host Dr Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nCelebrity heart surgeon Dr Mehmet Oz rose to prominence working on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before getting his own long-running series.\n\nBut how has he gone from TV personality to Donald Trump's choice for overseeing a massive government agency?\n\nThe 64-year-old, who started out as Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, became a household name during 13 seasons of The Dr Oz Show, which ran from 2009 to 2022.\n\nImage: Dr Oz during a TV appearance in 2012. Pic: AP\n\nHe was popular, though his promotion of alternative medicine, faith healing and various paranormal beliefs earned him criticism from a number of medical publications and physicians.\n\nThe critics accused him of blurring the lines between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 11:20 Who will be in Trump's White House?\n\nDespite the controversy, Dr Oz's show was a hit and his net worth sat between $100m (\u00a379m) and $315m (\u00a3249m) in 2022, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed that year.\n\nBeyond being an Emmy-winning TV show host, he is also an author of New York Times bestsellers, radio talk show host, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.\n\nHe was also a regular Fox News commentator, and a champion of unproven treatments for COVID including hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug whose use against the disease was also backed by Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Dr Oz holding his Emmy for outstanding talk show host in 2016. Pic: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nHe became a fierce critic of Joe Biden's government during the COVID pandemic, challenging its policies on social media.\n\nMoving into politics\n\nDr Oz played a lesser part in the first Trump administration from 2016, when he was appointed to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.\n\nBut it was in 2022, after his show concluded, when Dr Oz really transitioned into politics by running for US Senate as a Republican in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity status, with his campaign logo almost identical to his TV show logo.\n\nImage: Mehmet Oz campaigning for Senate in 2022. Pic: AP\n\nDuring his campaign rallies, he would talk up his \"number one health show in the world,\" give the odd piece of medical advice to supporters and spend a lengthy amount of time signing autographs and posing for photos.\n\nFollowing a court battle that went all the way to the US Supreme Court, Dr Oz narrowly won the primary over Dave McCormick by 951 votes, becoming the Republican candidate, but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.\n\nHis relationship with Trump\n\nImage: Donald Trump stands behind Dr Oz during rally in 2022. Pic: Reuters\n\nThe surgeon has had a long, personal relationship with the president-elect spanning back to the early 2000s.\n\nHe said in an interview during his Senate campaign that the pair first met in 2004 or 2005, when Dr Oz asked Mr Trump to use his golf course for an event for his children's charity.\n\nMr Trump agreed and, after that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Dr Oz interviewed him about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMr Trump appeared on his show, where he also said his wife Melania was \"a big fan\" of the doctor.\n\nThe pair then worked together when Mr Trump won the election and put Dr Oz on the President's Council.\n\nThen in 2022, Mr Trump was integral to Dr Oz's push for Senate, giving him his eagerly sought-after endorsement.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho does Trump want in his top team?\n\nTrump and Musk watch shaky rocket launch\n\n\"Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\" Mr Trump said when he first backed him.\n\n\"You know when you're in television for 18 years, that's like a poll,\" added the billionaire, who himself starred on 14 seasons of The Apprentice US.\n\n\"That means people like you.\"\n\nWhat will his role be?\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to take the role, Dr Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid, children's health insurance and the Affordable Care Act, better known as \"Obamacare\".\n\nThe programmes cover more than 160 million people, from new-borns to nursing home residents.\n\nCMS also plays a central role in the nation's $4.5trn health care economy, setting payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\n\"Dr Oz will be a leader in incentivising disease prevention, so we get the best results in the world for every dollar we spend on healthcare in our great country,\" the president-elect said in a statement.\n\n\"He will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"\n\nDr Oz said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the role and looked forward to \"serving my country to Make America Healthy Again\".\n\nHe, like all of Mr Trump's picks, must be questioned by members of the Senate before it votes on his appointment. Even with the Republicans in control, some of the picks could be blocked."

        "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\n\"Ours is a world of sights and sounds. We live by our eyes and ears and tend generally to be oblivious to the chemical happenings in our surrounds. Such happenings are ubiquitous. All organisms engender chemical signals, and all, in their respective ways, respond to the chemical emissions of others. \u2026 And it is a discipline in which discovery is still very much in order, for the interactions themselves remain in large measure to be uncovered.\" \u2013 Jerrold Meinwald and Thomas Eisner, 1995\n\nThe last part of the first paragraph of Meinwald and Eisner\u2019s abstract in their review article \"Chemical Ecology\" is just as true today as it was when it was published 30 years ago. There are a growing number of chemical ecologists, and many of them are being trained at the University\u2019s Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology.\n\nThe Hitchcock Center is named for its founding donor, Mick Hitchcock. Hitchcock is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for many years, helping to develop antiviral drugs, including the first once-daily three-drug combination pill to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hitchcock moved to Reno in 2009 (largely due to its proximity to good snowboarding) and has been involved at the University since.\n\nChristopher Jeffrey, a professor in the Department of Chemistry, started at the University the same day Hitchcock was giving a talk. Jeffrey attended the talk and later, the two had dinner together. Following this initial interaction, Jeffrey and Hitchcock began to talk about chemistry on a regular basis over dinners and started snowboarding together.\n\n\"[Mick] got to learn about what our research was, and it fell in line with exactly how he felt the future of science is going,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nHitchcock worked with Jeffrey to develop a multi-year program that would provide both research and teaching opportunities for students and faculty at the University.\n\n\"The idea was that, by funding the start up of the center over a period of years, it would allow time for the group to become independent by obtaining funding and grants from other sources, especially funding sources that are not usually available to researchers in single, independent laboratories,\" Hitchcock said.\n\nIn 2018, the Hitchcock Center officially opened as an interdisciplinary research unit, where graduate students could be trained to think in more disciplines than the normal higher education model allows for. The Hitchcock Center has developed a space where the lines are blurred between chemistry, biology and ecology.\n\nResearchers study systems in Nevada\u2019s dry, harsh deserts and the Amazon\u2019s lush, tropical rainforests. One major project studies Piper kelleyi, a wild relative of black pepper. The plant, found in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Andes, is widespread and supports many species, particularly caterpillars. The project involves collaboration with the Indigenous Kichwa and Waorani communities in Ecuador. These communities have used Piper as medicine for generations. The research project includes Lora Richards (Principal Investigator), Deena Schmidt, Thomas Parchman, Lee Dyer, Christopher Jeffrey, Craig Dodson and Casey Philbin (all faculty from the University), and scientists from the Kichwa and Waorani communities.\n\nA recent National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Traineeship (NRT) grant was awarded to the Hitchcock Center after seven previous applications for the incredibly competitive grant.\n\nThe $3 million grant will support at least 25 fellowships for students working in chemical ecology. Jeffrey credits the success of the proposal to Marjorie Matoq, the director of the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology graduate program, whose experience with monitoring program success, a critical part of any grant, was the last piece of the puzzle to secure this achievement.\n\n\"Those missing elements pushed us right over the top,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nThe proposal featured several areas of research, including evolution of chemically mediated interactions, chemistry of community interactions, chemistry of biological interactions: engines of biodiversity, and ecoimmunology and pest management. The NRT funding also includes support for the development of a new course: Chemistry of Biological Interactions.\n\nThe center promotes success for graduate students by providing a workshop series that will discuss topics like interdisciplinary communication, conflict resolutions, DEI/Ally training, team science and reproducible science. The NSF has emphasized the importance of making science reproducible and developing good data management practices.\n\n\"That grant, I would say, reflects the broader goals of our center,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nTo promote interdisciplinary research partnerships, the Hitchcock Center pairs two students on a single project who are participating in distinct areas of research. Zach Ledvina and Haley Dole are partnering up to teach each other the chemical and ecological characteristics of Piper kelleyi. Ledvina, a chemistry student pursuing his doctoral degree, and Dole, a doctoral student in the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology graduate program, each have unique skillsets and knowledge about the system that they can share with one another to elucidate the underlying \"chemical happenings\" in the system.\n\nThe center also provides stipends and research support for undergraduate students, and summer or semester internships with the biotechnology industry, natural resource management agencies, outreach education (including at the University\u2019s Museum of Natural History) and conservation organizations.\n\nSpeakers at the Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology Symposium gather for a photo before Paul Cox's keynote lecture.\n\nThe Hitchcock Center just hosted its second Hitchcock Symposium at the University of Nevada, Reno at Lake Tahoe, which brought a long-time supporter and advisory member of the center, Paul Alan Cox, back to campus. Cox is an ethnobotanist who searches for cures or treatments for diseases in the natural world, particularly in so-called \"blue zones\" where much of the population lives longer than the average human lifespan. Cox previously spoke at the University for a Discover Science lecture in 2016 and continues to advocate for the center through support on grants and as an adviser to the programs.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got the right people, the right science, the right questions,\" Cox said about the Hitchcock Center during his talk.\n\nThe center received funding from multiple companies to support the symposium, including Untamed Wine Estates, where alumna McKenzie Shipman-Sanvido '15 (biology, analytical chemistry) serves as vice president, which provided raffle prizes for public attendees; Agilent, a company that develops cutting edge instrumentation, which provided academic and speaker grants; and Alcami, which provided award sponsorship for student presentations.\n\nThree Ph.D. candidates were presented with student awards at the end of the conference: Tanzil Mahmud (left) won the oral presentation award, Yingshi Feng (middle) won the poster presentation award and Ari Grele won the Scott Chadwick Outstanding Chemical Ecology Graduate Award.\n\nIn addition to the Hitchcock Center, Jeffrey said there are several other chemical ecology centers around the world, including at the Pennsylvania State University, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\n\n\n\"What makes our program unique is that it is chemistry-forward,\" Jeffrey said.\n\n\n\nThe Hitchcock Center was recently elected to a multi-state consortium of chemical ecology centers led by Penn State and Cornell focused on using chemical ecology to solve agricultural challenges. This election has elevated the center\u2019s status as an internationally recognized contributor to the discipline and paved the way for the center to apply for new agriculture grants. Jeffrey recently attended the International Chemical Ecology short course, which rotates between most of the major centers for chemical ecology. Jeffrey is working out dates with his colleagues for the Hitchcock Center to host this short course in the future. The Hitchcock Center has also been developing partnerships with other universities to work toward applied research in agriculture and medicine.\n\nOne part of the many projects Jeffrey is excited about is the synthetic chemistry being used to understand the relationships between caterpillars and Piper kelleyi. As a synthetic chemist, Jeffrey, who had just finished his postdoctoral work, read an article published in 2007 that said the field was facing the slow death of natural products chemistry. Today, Jeffrey is excited that natural products and synthetic chemistry are going hand-in-hand, playing an important role in chemical ecology research, and are able to directly address some of the biggest questions in science, such as explaining the biodiversity of our planet.\n\nSince the Hitchcock Center was formally recognized on campus, faculty and the center itself have received $30 million in grants, comprised of four NSF grants (including the NRT and Piper kelleyi research), a NASA astrobiology research grant (in partnership with scientists at the Desert Research Institute) and others.\n\nScott Chadwick of Alcami has also supported the center by endowing a scholarship for an outstanding graduate student in chemical ecology.\n\n\"My goal for the center is that it will eventually take on a life of its own,\" Hitchcock said. \"Much like seed funding for an entrepreneurial business venture, the strategy is to start the ball rolling with enough energy to allow it to continue independently in due course.\""

But here\u2019s the good news: no-code tools are rewriting the rules of entrepreneurship. They allow you to build apps, automate processes, and test ideas without breaking the bank.\n\nYou no longer need to rely on expensive developers or wait months to bring your vision to life. No-code strategies empower you to create and grow your business while keeping costs low. In this article, I\u2019ll share how you can leverage no-code tools to cut startup costs, streamline operations, and make every dollar count.\n\nWhy Cutting Costs Matters for Startups\n\nEvery startup faces the challenge of doing more with less. When you\u2019re just starting out, funds are often limited, and you need to allocate them wisely. Cutting costs isn\u2019t just about saving money\u2014it\u2019s about giving your business room to grow without unnecessary financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can avoid hiring full development teams, reduce software expenses, and speed up your go-to-market strategy. Imagine being able to build a functioning product or automate a workflow in days rather than months, all at a fraction of the cost.\n\n1. Use No-Code Tools to Build Your MVP\n\nYour Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first version of your product, designed to test your idea with real users. Traditionally, building an MVP required a team of developers and thousands of dollars. No-code tools have changed the game.\n\nPlatforms like Bubble, Webflow, and Glide let you build fully functional apps and websites without any coding knowledge. You can design, test, and launch your product in weeks instead of months, saving significant development costs.\n\nExample:\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to launch an ecommerce store. Using Webflow, you can create a visually stunning and functional website without hiring a web developer. Need a mobile app for your store? Tools like Glide or Adalo make it possible.\n\nCheck out this no code tools directory to explore platforms that fit your needs.\n\n2. Automate Repetitive Tasks to Save Time and Money\n\nRepetitive tasks like sending follow-up emails, updating spreadsheets, or managing customer support can eat up your time. Hiring people to handle these tasks can also strain your budget. No-code automation tools like Zapier and Make (formerly Integromat) help you streamline these processes.\n\nFor instance, you can automate:\n\nSending a welcome email to new subscribers.\n\nAdding leads from forms to your CRM.\n\nUpdating inventory levels across platforms.\n\nAutomation not only saves money but also frees up your time to focus on scaling your business. You don\u2019t have to manage everything manually when these tools work in the background.\n\n3. Create Marketing Assets Without Hiring Designers\n\nProfessional design services can be expensive, especially for startups on a budget. No-code tools like Canva and Visme let you create stunning graphics, social media posts, and presentations without needing a designer. These platforms offer templates and drag-and-drop interfaces that make designing simple.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you\u2019re promoting your business on Instagram, Canva allows you to create eye-catching posts and stories that stand out. With no additional cost, you can maintain a professional online presence and attract more customers.\n\nFor entrepreneurs exploring best side business ideas for entrepreneurs, using design tools like Canva can also help build your brand with minimal investment.\n\n4. Streamline Customer Management with No-Code CRM Tools\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) is crucial for any business, but traditional CRM software can be expensive. No-code CRMs like Airtable and Notion allow you to manage your customer data, track interactions, and even automate follow-ups\u2014all on a budget.\n\nHow to Use No-Code CRMs:\n\nTrack sales leads and conversations in Airtable.\n\nUse Notion to create a centralized hub for client details and project updates.\n\nAutomate lead assignment and notifications with Zapier integrations.\n\nThese tools give you the functionality of big-name CRMs without the hefty price tag.\n\n5. Test and Scale Business Ideas Without High Costs\n\nOne of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face is testing business ideas quickly without wasting money. With no-code tools, you can experiment with different ideas and pivot when needed, all without draining your budget.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild a prototype of your app using Bubble.\n\nSet up a landing page to validate your idea with Webflow.\n\nUse Glide to create a mobile app for testing a new service.\n\nNo-code tools give you the flexibility to adapt your business strategy based on feedback. This agility can save you from costly mistakes and help you focus on what works.\n\n6. Reduce Software Expenses with Free and Low-Cost No-Code Tools\n\nInstead of investing in multiple expensive tools, you can use no-code platforms that offer free or low-cost plans. Many tools provide all the functionality you need at an affordable price, especially when you\u2019re just starting out.\n\nTool Purpose Starting Price Bubble App development $25/month Zapier Workflow automation Free (limited) Canva Graphic design Free (with pro options) Airtable CRM and databases Free\n\nBy choosing the right tools, you can reduce overhead while maintaining the quality and efficiency of your operations.\n\n7. Work with No-Code Agencies for Complex Projects\n\nWhile no-code tools empower you to build on your own, there are times when you might need expert guidance, especially for more complex projects. A Zeroqode is top No code Agency that can help you bring your ideas to life faster and more efficiently than traditional development teams.\n\nFor instance, if you want to create a custom app with advanced functionality, a no-code agency can save you time and money by delivering a professional solution tailored to your needs.\n\n8. Leverage Free Online Resources and Communities\n\nOne of the hidden benefits of no-code tools is the thriving communities that surround them. Platforms like Bubble and Webflow have active forums where users share tips, templates, and solutions. These resources can help you learn faster and troubleshoot without spending extra money.\n\nPro Tip: Many no-code tools also offer free tutorials and courses to help you get started. Use these resources to build your skills and avoid costly mistakes.\n\nConclusion\n\nStarting a business doesn\u2019t have to drain your savings. By using no-code tools, you can build, automate, and grow your startup while keeping costs low. From creating an MVP to managing customers and streamlining workflows, no-code strategies let you focus on expanding your business without financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can turn your entrepreneurial dreams into reality without spending a fortune."

        "article_content": "Finnish start-up Quicksave Interactive wants to make websites interactive again with WebGL technology by launching QSApp, or no-code editors to make interactive web sites more accessible.\n\nThis means that ordinary websites can make use of tech that will make the sites more game-like and interactive. But the technology goes beyond gaming as well.\n\nIn a digital world where nearly every business has a website or online store, standing out has never been more crucial. If you remember the golden age of Flash, websites were more than static pages\u2014they were immersive experiences with soul and interactivity. Those days aren\u2019t just warm memories anymore.\n\nThe power of the browser has grown immensely. WebGL should have enabled expressive, high-performance content that matches native-level quality across all devices and screens. However, accessing that power has remained a challenge: game engines are often too technical and come with inconsistent web support, while traditional website builders are limited by basic HTML and fall short of offering the full potential of HTML5 and WebGL.\n\nQSApp makes the power of HTML5 accessible. Quicksave Interactive has developed a powerful suite of two no-code editors designed for artists and designers, developers, and business owners who want their websites and web stores to stand out effortlessly. QSApps can be embedded into any web page, and they can access code and be accessed by code if need be.\n\nQSApps\n\nQuicksave\u2019s QSApp will make it easier to publish WebGL interactive sites.\n\nWith a no-code authoring interface and great performance on any modern device, QSApp offers users infinite creative possibilities, enabling them to stand out in today\u2019s competitive digital landscape and to:\n\nCreate compelling interactive web experiences without coding\n\nEmbed expressive UX to any website with a single line of code\n\nPublish as standalone web content\n\nWhen Quicksave was founded in 2017 by game industry veterans Elina Arponen, Timo K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen, and Ville-Kalle Arponen, they quickly encountered a major challenge: none of the existing game development tools were powerful, fast, or efficient enough to meet their needs for creating high-performance complex user interfaces for games. So, they had to build their own.\n\nWhat started as an internal solution evolved over the years into what is now the Quicksave. They created a toolkit \u2014 an HTML5 WebGL toolkit that includes both the UI Editor and Machine Editor.\n\nQuicksave founders. Elina Arponen is in the middle.\n\nThe tools have empowered Quicksave to publish over 10 games on seven different platforms for millions of players. Today, the Quicksave Toolkit stands as a proven, battle-tested technology for developing high-quality, high-performance WebGL games and interactive experiences.\n\n\u201cWe have been licensing the Quicksave Toolkit for the development of HTML5 games. However, now with QSApp, we are taking that power of creating interactive web content one crucial step further. I am so excited we can bring this spark of creativity into any web page out there,\u201d said Quicksave CEO Elina Arponen, in a statement.\n\nQSApp will be officially announced on November 20 at Quicksave\u2019s exclusive Slush side event, where guests will be the first to witness a game-changing reveal that will transform web development with HTML5. This unique gathering promises an in-depth look at QSApp\u2019s groundbreaking capabilities and a live demo showcasing its potential.\n\nQuicksave\u2019s team.\n\nYou can also see examples of QSApps in action at qsapp.quicksave.fi and contact the team. Quicksave is signing in pilot customers now and the full launch of the product will follow in 2025."

        "article_content": "H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company\u2019s five co-founders left over \u201coperational and business disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut the company has kept swimming, and today it\u2019s announcing its first product: Runner H, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation. It\u2019s built atop the startup\u2019s own, proprietary \u201ccompact\u201d LLM based on just 2 billion parameters.\n\nH has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. CEO Charles Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents \u201coff the shelf\u201d that have been pre-built by H, as well as for developers to create their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how these services work.\n\nInitially, using those APIs will be free, and later there will be a payment model introduced.\n\nEven using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A to build what Kantor describes as part of the second era of AI \u2014 with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cBut this second era will be as capital intensive as the first one.\u201d\n\n(Recall the $230 million H has already raised \u2014 it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year \u2014 was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner, and Xavier Niel; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung, and UiPath.)\n\nKantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance, and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product.\n\n\u201cEverything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,\u201d he said.\n\nRunner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing.\n\nRPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform \u2014 such as reading forms, checking boxes, and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites, and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources.\n\nQuality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the \u201cmaintenance burdens\u201d around website testing \u2014 validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods \u2014 in particular when modifications have been made.\n\nBPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more.\n\nThere has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.) But Runner H is taking a very different approach with just 2 billion parameters, both for its LLM and for its computer-vision-based \u201cVLM.\u201d Kantor\u2019s argument is that this makes them significantly more efficient in terms of cost and operations, key when working on winning and keeping business deals, and H\u2019s own operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe are specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building for the agentic era.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims that it works: It says that its compact model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s \u201cComputer Use\u201d by 29% (based on WebVoyager benchmarks) as well as models from Mistral and Meta.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

        "article_content": "Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) MSRP $4,560.00 Score Details \u201cIf you\u2019re on a quest for power, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) lies at the end of the journey.\u201d Pros Excellent overall and graphics performance\n\nBright, vivid display\n\nEye-catching design\n\nComfortable, customizable keyboard\n\nGreat webcam\n\nHealthy offering of ports Cons Prohibitively expensive\n\nWeak speakers\n\nI love an obnoxious laptop, and the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 16-inch laptop is most certainly obnoxious and proud of it. From its dappled forged carbon fiber lid, to its overclockable Intel Core i9 HX processor and Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, this is a laptop that isn\u2019t afraid to throw its weight around. And why should it be? With specs that powerful, you can game, create content, and plow through any work that might fall into your lap. Hell, you might find Jimmy Hoffa with this thing (OK, I\u2019m being facetious with that last one, but the Legion 9i is a serious powerhouse).\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHowever, a pair of subpar speakers mar an otherwise great laptop. And we can\u2019t forget the price, which will prevent all but the most deep-pocketed gamers from partaking in the awesomeness. But if you want an absolute force of one of the best gaming laptops available, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) is a must-see.\n\nSpecs and configurations\n\nLenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 Dimensions 14.1 x 10.93 x 0.75 ~.89 inches Weight 5.51 pounds Processor Intel Core i9-14900HX Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090/Intel UHD Graphics RAM Up to 64GB LPDDR5 5600MHz Display 16-inch 3,200 x 2000 mini-LED Storage Up to 2TB (RAID 0 1TB+1TB) PCIe SSD (Gen 4) Touch No Ports 2x Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A, 1x, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type C, 1x HDMI 2.1 Wireless Killer WiFi 6E* 802.11AX (2 x 2) and Bluetooth 5.1 Webcam 1080p + IR camera Operating system Windows 11 Pro Battery 99 watt-hour Price $3,840\n\nLenovo only offers one pre-built configuration of the Legion 9i Gen 9 on the company site, and the $4,560 price will definitely make more than a few wallets wince.\n\nThe configuration I reviewed has a 2.2-GHz Intel Core i9-14900HX Meteor Lake Refresh processor with 32GB of 5600Mhz DDR5 RAM, two 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSDs in RAID 0 configuration, integrated Intel UHD Graphics, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 mini-LED, 16:10 aspect ratio display with a 165Hz refresh rate and 3-millisecond response time and Windows 11 Home. However, you can save yourself almost $1,000 if you purchase the system from B&H which currently has the laptop on sale for $3,399.\n\nThe base model of the Gen 9 can be found in the configure menu on Lenovo\u2019s website. It costs $3,840 and halves the storage and drops the GPU to a 4080 GPU with 12GB of video memory. If you want to max out the specs, prepare to fork out $4,665, which will add Windows 11 Pro and 64GB of RAM to the mix.\n\nA unique, elegant design\n\nThe Legion 9i doesn\u2019t look like any other gaming laptop on the market. It doesn\u2019t even look like any laptop in its line. That\u2019s because Lenovo used forged carbon fiber for its lid that with the company\u2019s eight-layer stamping method, the lid is 10% lighter and stronger than regular aluminum. In terms of looks, the lid falls somewhere in between one of those old-school composition notebooks and some elegant camouflage. And while that process makes for a lighter, tougher lid, the slightly textured panel is a one-of-one with each notebook sporting a different pattern. As nice as the lid looks, you\u2019ll want to have a microfiber cloth handy as the lid is highly susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.\n\nThere\u2019s a small silver metal Lenovo plate embedded into the lower-left corner of the lid with a large RGB-backlit Legion emblem running vertically down the right. The camera and mic housing sits top center with its glossy metal covering protruding ever so slightly, The hinge connecting the lid and bottom of the laptop is large and extends into a rather large vent that has several ports. A thin RGB light strip creates a line of delineation between the hinge and vent.\n\nThe notebook\u2019s interior and undercarriage are made primarily of recycled magnesium colored carbon black. Compared to other gaming laptops, the palm rest is rather small, but there\u2019s still enough room to accommodate most wrists and a small metal Lenovo tag in the lower-right corner. The trackpad is long instead of tall and sits below the island-style keyboard as it glows seductively. Above that is a large air vent with the power button sitting front and center. The 16-inch display is ensconced in matte black bezels with a small lip at the top making the lid easier to open.\n\nThe Legion 9i\u2019s undercarriage is almost all vent with two raised rubber feet to assist with airflow. The back foot has a middle divot stamped with Legion, which is a nice touch. You have a pair of bottom-firing speakers toward the front and two large vents along the sides. The bottom panel is held in place with six screws in case you want to access the laptop\u2019s interior.\n\nThe notebook has a solid array of ports and slots befitting a laptop of this size. You have a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port on the right with a physical camera disable switch. On the left sits an SD card reader and a headset jack. You\u2019ll find the rest of the ports in the rear with another USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a HMDI 2.1 port, Ethernet port, and a proprietary DC-in jack.\n\nCompared to its competitors, the 5.51-pound, 0.75 ~0.89 inch x 14.1 x 10.93-inch Legion 9i is almost a lightweight. The Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 (0.91 x 11.57 x 15.71 inches) is the big man on campus here at 6.83 pounds, but keep in mind that this is an 18-inch laptop. Next up, is the Alienware m16 R2 (0.93 x 14.33 x 9.81 inches), which weighs 5.75 pounds. And finally, we have the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (13.94 x 9.69 x 0.64 inches) that tips the scales at 4.1 pounds, which is the lightest of the bunch.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nIn the battle between matte and glossy displays, Lenovo has chosen matte for the Legion 9i. And while matte panels effectively cut down on glare and reflections, they\u2019ve been known to deliver muted color. I found the 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 mini-LED panel delivered great color and detail, which took some of the hurt from the many deaths I suffered while playing Black Myth: Wukong. Speaking of which, thanks to the inclusion of Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync software and the panel\u2019s 165Hz refresh rate and 3ms response rate, my attacks, dodges, and parries were as smooth as butter, as were my myriad of deaths.\n\nThe display achieved 100% of the sRGB color gamut. However, on the Adobe sRGB and DCI-P3 gamuts, the screen reached 88 and 99%, respectively. Both results are short of the 100% Lenovo claims. But in case the panel isn\u2019t as vivid as you\u2019d like, the laptop has Dolby Vision software to adjust the color temperature. My light meter clocked the display\u2019s brightness at 692 nits, which is impressive for a matte panel.\n\nI knew when I took my initial tour around the laptop, I identified one of its few flaws: the bottom-mounted speaker. And sure enough, once I started streaming tracks on Spotify, the pair of 2W Harmon speakers produced mediocre audio. The volume couldn\u2019t fill my medium-sized living room. Even worse, the low end is hollow more often than not with weak bass and percussion no matter the genre. And this is despite having Nahmic\u2019s audio software preinstalled, which is one of the better apps out there.\n\nBut the audio quality deteriorates when using the laptop on your lap. My thighs swallowed up the tiny speaker grilles, which in turn, muffled the audio. You\u2019re definitely going to need a pair of headphones or a gaming headset if you have any expectation of good audio.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nLenovo\u2019s smile-shaped keys bring a smile to my face. While they\u2019re not as good as what you\u2019d find on the company\u2019s ThinkPad line of laptops, the Legion 9i\u2019s keyboard with its Chiclet-style keys with their 1.5mm key travel are super comfy to type on with firm feedback and no bottoming out. The keycaps are large with generous spacing. And while I rarely use the NumPad, I\u2019m always glad to see it included. I surpassed my usual 70-words-per-minute average on the MonkeyType typing test, hitting 85 wpm.\n\nThe keyboard features per-key backlighting, which allows you to create a custom light show with every key glowing in a different shade via the Lenovo Vantage app. This is also where you can set macros, monitor system health, adjust camera and display settings, and much more.\n\nThe Legion 9i\u2019s touchpad is smaller than what I\u2019m used to nowadays, but it got the job done. Multitouch gestures such as pinch-zoom, two-finger scroll and three-finger tap performed seamlessly. The trackpad offers good palm rejection with strong feedback on the bottom corners.\n\nWebcam and connectivity\n\nThe Legion 9i has one of the best integrated webcams I\u2019ve seen this year on a gaming laptop. The color on the 1080p shooter is great, capturing the exact shade of bubblegum pink of my wrapped locs. Details were so sharp, you can see almost every wrinkle in my sunflower yellow shirt. It\u2019ll definitely hold up in a video call or a live stream.\n\nAnd in some other webcam fun, the laptop has Tobii\u2019s eye-tracking software preinstalled in the form of Tobii Aware and Horizon. The former dims the screen when you\u2019re not looking at it while the latter lets you control a game using head-tracking.\n\nAs for connectivity, the Legion 9i has a Killer WiFi 6E* 802.11AX (2 x 2) network card with Bluetooth 5.1.\n\nCPU performance\n\nWho ordered a ridiculous amount of power, because the Legion 9i has a double serving. The notebook sports a 24-core Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market. The juggernaut came out swinging on the Cinebench R24 multi-core test, beating all competitors.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Lenovo only edged out its predecessor by a few points. And as usual, the MacBook Pro 16 with its M3 Max chipset beat out all challengers. The M4 Max would surely push this comparison even further, though we\u2019ve only tested the M4 Pro model so far. The single-core portion of the Cinebench R24 had a similar outcome with the Legion 9i leading the gaming laptops, and the MacBook being the overall winner. The Legion 9i managed to score a definitive victory over everyone during the GPU portion of Cinebench R24, including the MacBook.\n\nWe got similar results on both the multi- and single-thread runs of Geekbench 6 test, with the Legion surpassing its gaming laptop rivals. It\u2019s interesting to see how close last year\u2019s Legion 9i is to its descendent. But as powerful as the new kid on the block is, it couldn\u2019t overtake the MacBook 16 with its highly optimized chipset and operating system. Although the Legion is primarily a gaming laptop, it is more than capable of handling any video, photo, or audio editing project you have up your sleeve. Running the PugetBench tests for both Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, the Lenovo maintained a slight lead over everything but the MacBook Pro.\n\nGaming\n\nWhile it\u2019s nice that the Legion can handle all your productivity and content creation tasks, you\u2019re here to game. And with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the Legion 9i is more than ready for those marathon gaming sessions. That\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t some competition. While the Legion 9i achieved high marks on the 3DMark Time Spy test, it wasn\u2019t enough to topple the ROG Strix Scar 18. The Legion however, is only a few points shy from matching the Scar. The Legion 9i got the upper hand on the 3D FireStrike test.\n\n1600p resolution has become the sweet spot for many gamers, but at its 2000p native resolution, the Legion 9i frame rate never dropped below 90 frames per second, even on titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, and Forza Horizon 5, which are some of the most graphically taxing games on the market.\n\nThanks to the GPU and its 16GB of video memory, you can crank up all the settings to the max and that includes ray tracing. And if you want to squeeze every frame out of the system, feel free to enable Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. My only other gripe with the Legion 9i is the fans. The laptop\u2019s trio of fans are seriously loud with Performance mode enabled. It\u2019s to be expected with a laptop of this caliber as is the heat exhaust blowing from the top of the keyboard deck.\n\nBattery life\n\nGaming laptops this stacked are a series of checks and balances. Sure, you\u2019ll get ridiculous power, but man, is that battery life going to suck. However, the Legion 9i lasted longer than expected with a time of four hours, nine minutes on the video playback test with the power setting on Best Performance at 100 nits of brightness. That\u2019s a little longer than the Scar 18, but it falls short of the Alienware m16 R2 and the ROG Zephyrus G16.\n\nStill, that time is respectable for a gaming laptop, especially one with these heavy duty specs. Thanks to Nvidia\u2019s Advanced Optimus software, which is essentially a MUX switch, the laptop can switch over to its integrated Intel UHD Graphics chip, when handling less graphically taxing tasks. That way, the laptop can last longer on a charge.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf you\u2019re on a quest for power, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) lies at the end of the journey. The desktop replacement is a certified beast, sporting a one-two punch of an Intel Core i9 processor and an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU. Whether it\u2019s gaming, creating content, or productivity, the Lenovo Legion 9i can handle it all with unflappable aplomb. On top of that, it\u2019s got a lovely display, comfortable, customizable keyboard, a crispy webcam, and it\u2019s got an interesting design.\n\nThe only real flaw the notebook has is its weak speakers and of course, the exorbitant price, which is a shame as the Legion 9i is just a stone\u2019s throw from perfect. Offering some more customization in terms of configurations may have allowed a more affordable entry point too. Sure the fans can get loud, but that\u2019s to be expected in a gaming laptop.\n\nIf you want something with longer battery life, consider the Alienware m16 R2 or the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16. But for people that want power, plain and simple. It\u2019s a bit of a niche laptop at this price, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find something better than the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch)."
