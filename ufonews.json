            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

            "date": "4h",
            "source": "AV Club",
            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh has never made a horror movie, and certainly not of the ghostly, haunted variety. His movies tend to be exacting, precise, so even when they\u2019re frightening, as with the stalker nightmare Unsane or the chilling disease thriller Contagion, that fear comes from witnessing a process failing with just as much efficiency as when it succeeds. Death, as depicted in his new horror thriller Presence, has no such clarity of success and failure. The sense of loss left behind feels like a kind of failure, yet it is both inevitable and unknowable. These are some of the mysteries eating away at teenage Chloe (Callina Liang), who has just lost her best friend Nadia to a drug overdose and is now moving into a new house with her semi-functional family.\n\nYes, it\u2019s the old something-not-quite-right-with-this-house-that\u2019s-supposed-to-solve-everything business: Chloe feels shivers of offness in her new home, which concerns her sweet-natured but frustrated father Chris (Chris Sullivan) and mostly annoys her jock brother Tyler (Eddy Maday)\u2014who is the clear favorite of distracted mother Rebecca (Lucy Liu), further bedeviled by some vague but obviously Soderberghian financial malfeasance at work. As far as Rebecca is concerned, that\u2019s the issue that should require discussion in hushed tones, not the creaks and chills of otherness that Chloe feels. Is it Nadia, Chloe wonders? Or just, as her parents assume, an expression of her grief and loneliness?\n\nThe identity question may linger, but there\u2019s no fake suspense over whether Chloe is imagining things. To depict this haunting, Soderbergh imposes a system onto a spiritual dimension where none should necessarily exist: He shoots the entire movie from the point of view of an unseen spirit that does indeed drift through the house; \u201cpresence\u201d is also, essentially, the title character. It\u2019s a Paranormal Activity movie turned inside-out: Rather than a largely stationary camera capturing flickers of spooky but eerily realistic movement in the frame, the camera remains mobile and hovering, its ghostliness an invisible but driving force. Like the Paranormal films, there is an element of surveillance: The camera travels through rooms unnoticed, overhearing bits of conversation and observing actions kept secret from other characters. It\u2019s at once omniscient and deeply subjective. There\u2019s also another technical challenge on hand for Soderbergh, who has professed far more affinity for the cut than the epically long take: to stay true to his POV gimmick, most scenes are staged in single unbroken shots. Cuts move forward in time, not within a scene.\n\nThe simultaneous braininess and gimmickry of this technique, applied to a David Koepp screenplay that unapologetically eschews A Ghost Story-style metaphysical traversing, could have stranded Presence in a liminal zone between shlock and airless experiment. What Soderbergh winds up achieving is more reminiscent of his throwback crime pictures, like the Criss Cross remake The Underneath or more recent thrillers like the period noir No Sudden Move and the intensely Early 2020s Kimi. That is to say that Presence has the story, limited scope, and 85-minute runtime of a 1940s B-picture, infused\u2014as those pictures often were, and as his crime movies usually are\u2014with a disciplined style and contemporary electricity. It\u2019s budget Gothic that\u2019s worth every penny and then some.\n\nIn that context, it\u2019s less surprising that Soderbergh didn\u2019t recruit anyone from his ever-growing unofficial rep company for this cast: No Matt Damon as the dad, no Catherine Zeta-Jones as the mom, no Riley Keough as a cool aunt dropping by. (Julia Fox, however, does have one scene as a real-estate agent. No word on whether she\u2019s bumpin\u2019 that.) The central quartet playing the family all does wonderful work, and in a movie with several talented young performers, frequent stage/TV/character actor Sullivan feels like the belated discovery as the flustered but loving father. The familial relationships that Soderbergh and Koepp set up aren\u2019t necessarily wide-ranging or unpredictable, but as Presence ticks toward an inevitable confrontation, they\u2019re surprisingly involving. There\u2019s a circularity to Presence that is both entirely in keeping with a haunted-house story and, in this telling, even moving. It\u2019s yet another genre that Soderbergh has worked like a problem, and produced an elegant solution.\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nWriter: David Koepp\n\nStarring: Callina Liang, Chris Sullivan, Lucy Liu, Eddy Maday, Julia Fox\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2025"

Did you draw on anything from your personal life for your portrayal of a \u201cboy mom\u201d?\n\nLiu: It\u2019s funny\u2014I didn\u2019t, because [Tyler] was in a very different age range. I just worked off of [David Koepp\u2019s] script because it was all there. It was hard because she\u2019s not necessarily a character that is really easy to understand; there\u2019s a lot of mystery and smoke. There are a lot of secrets, and I love that David doesn\u2019t reveal them, even at the end. You never find out what happened with her work, with her husband, with the lawyer. In some ways, that backstory is a little bit of a MacGuffin. Everything shifts into something much more intangible\u2014emotions of grief and loss and what that does to a person. It opens her up and creates this huge cavern for something else, something that\u2019s not about getting ahead in her work life or her son\u2019s life.\n\nIt\u2019s usually only in films specifically about the Asian American experience that you see an Asian American family. I\u2019m curious if it felt liberating, in some way, to focus purely on the dynamic of a mother and daughter and the themes of the movie without racial identity being a focus.\n\nLiang: A hundred percent. The entire time you were asking that question, I thought, Absolutely. It was very freeing for me to, just once, be cast in something that had nothing [to do with] race. It was nothing about what I looked like, but it was just, simply, you are this person, you\u2019re in a house, you\u2019re experiencing ghost stuff, you\u2019re struggling with your family. Like, just be a girl. Obviously, in the industry, a lot of progress has already been made, but there\u2019s a lot of progress [still] to be made. A lot of tokenism and things like that still happen.\n\nLiu: It\u2019s such a long road. There\u2019s this constant feeling that they\u2019re including somebody for diversity\u2019s sake, like picking one person from each [race or ethnicity] and throwing them in there, or there\u2019s only one role that can be diverse. God forbid, there\u2019s more than one role! It didn\u2019t cross my mind at first because I think Steven was really the focal point, calling me to this whole project. But now that you mention it, I\u2019m seeing, of course, it was such a relief to not have to think about that. It\u2019s not a highlight\u2014it\u2019s just a given."

Ayad took second place in the graduate-student division of the competition; Tsyvinsky and Rivera took second and third, respectively, among the undergraduate contestants.\n\nTo underscore the importance of continuing federal funding, their 90-second videos take viewers into UC Santa Cruz's research labs and, as you might guess, into the ocean. In Ayad's video, she explains how she studies coral reefs using remote-sensing technologies to monitor their health. After an unprecedented marine heat wave in 2023 that caused mass bleaching along the Florida Keys and in the Caribbean, Ayad swam back and forth in SCUBA gear to gather data to create a digital 3-D model to capture the extent of the bleaching event.\n\n\"Without coral reefs, we wouldn't have protection from storm surges, resulting in more extreme flooding events. Marine species would lose their homes, resulting in a collapse of our food sources,\" Ayad says. \"We need to fund it forward because we need science to understand how we can save the reefs in this changing climate.\"\n\nTsyvinsky, a third-year chemistry major, studies cancer mutations, testing if specific mutations could be detected in gene-expression data. For her entry, Tsyvinsky introduces UC Santa Cruz's Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative, which uses computational approaches to genetic data to identify less toxic or more effective treatments.\n\n\"It's through funding that rising scientists like myself can be supported in learning scientific methods and be introduced to a health issue that needs attention more than ever,\" Tsyvinsky says in her video:\n\nRivera, a fourth-year biochemistry and molecular biology major, does Alzheimer's-related research with fruit flies. Rivera's video starts with her zooming onto campus on an electric skateboard, followed by footage of our soaring redwoods, ultimately entering a long hallway lined by doors\u2014each seeming to offer the promise of scientific discovery.\n\n\"Federal funding and other funding is so important to research like ours,\" Rivera says. \"Everyday, when I go to my lab, I walk by many other labs that are doing incredible things, and you never know when the next breakthrough might happen.\"\n\nYou can see all the winning videos from the Science Coalition's 2024 competition on YouTube."

            "date": "MIT Technology Review1h",
            "source": "MIT Technology Review",
            "article_content": "This new AI energy race is inseparable from the positioning of AI as essential for national security and US competitiveness with China. OpenAI laid out its position in a blog post in October, writing, \u201cAI is a transformational technology that can be used to strengthen democratic values or to undermine them. That\u2019s why we believe democracies should continue to take the lead in AI development.\u201d Then in December, the company went a step further and reversed its policy against working with the military, announcing it would develop AI models with the defense-tech company Anduril to help take down drones around military bases.\n\nThat same month, Sam Altman said during an interview with The Free Press that the Biden administration was \u201cnot that effective\u201d in shepherding AI: \u201cThe things that I think should have been the administration\u2019s priorities, and I hope will be the next administration\u2019s priorities, are building out massive AI infrastructure in the US, having a supply chain in the US, things like that.\u201d\n\nThat characterization glosses over the CHIPS Act, a $52 billion stimulus to the domestic chips industry that is, at least on paper, aligned with Altman\u2019s vision. (It also preceded an executive order Biden issued just last week, to lease federal land to host the type of gigawatt-scale data centers that Altman had been asking for.)\n\nIntentionally or not, Altman\u2019s posture aligned him with the growing camaraderie between President Trump and Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Pichai all sat directly behind Trump\u2019s family at the inauguration on Monday, and Altman also attended. Many of them had also made sizable donations to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund, with Altman personally throwing in $1 million.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to view the inauguration as evidence that these tech leaders are aligned with each other, and with other players in Trump\u2019s orbit. But there are still some key dividing lines that will be worth watching. Notably, there\u2019s the clash over H-1B visas, which allow many noncitizen AI researchers to work in the US. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (who is, as of this week, no longer a part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency) have been pushing for that visa program to be expanded. This sparked backlash from some allies of the Trump administration, perhaps most loudly Steve Bannon.\n\nAnother fault line is the battle between open- and closed-source AI. Google and OpenAI prevent anyone from knowing exactly what\u2019s in their most powerful models, often arguing that this keeps them from being used improperly by bad actors. Musk has sued OpenAI and Microsoft over the issue, alleging that closed-source models are antithetical to OpenAI\u2019s hybrid nonprofit structure. Meta, whose Llama model is open-source, recently sided with Musk in that lawsuit. Venture capitalist and Trump ally Marc Andreessen echoed these criticisms of OpenAI on X just hours after the inauguration. (Andreessen has also said that making AI models open-source \u201cmakes overbearing regulations unnecessary.\u201d)\n\nFinally, there are the battles over bias and free speech. The vastly different approaches that social media companies have taken to moderating content\u2014including Meta\u2019s recent announcement that it would end its US fact-checking program\u2014raise questions about whether the way AI models are moderated will continue to splinter too. Musk has lamented what he calls the \u201cwokeness\u201d of many leading models, and Andreessen said on Tuesday that \u201cChinese LLMs are much less censored than American LLMs\u201d (though that\u2019s not quite true, given that many Chinese AI models have government-mandated censorship in place that forbids particular topics). Altman has been more equivocal: \u201cNo two people are ever going to agree that one system is perfectly unbiased,\u201d he told The Free Press.\n\nIt\u2019s only the start of a new era in Washington, but the White House has been busy. It has repealed many executive orders signed by President Biden, including the landmark order on AI that imposed rules for government use of the technology (while it appears to have kept Biden\u2019s order on leasing land for more data centers). Altman is busy as well. OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank reportedly plan to spend up to $500 billion on a joint venture for new data centers; the project was announced by President Trump, with Altman standing alongside. And according to Axios, Altman will also be part of a closed-door briefing with government officials on January 30, reportedly about OpenAI\u2019s development of a powerful new AI agent."

The software is built on Electron, a cross-platform framework that uses web standards based on Google's Chromium.\n\nThe shared underlying technology means ByteDance can \"directly migrate plug-ins and settings\", and the familiar interface allows developers to quickly get started, according to Chinese tech blogger XixiaoyaoQAQ, who published a review on WeChat.\n\nTrae \"makes programming more accessible to the public so you can personally build projects from scratch, even if you have no development experience, no knowledge of code, or even English\", the blogger wrote.\n\nXixiaoyaoQAQ tested Trae by asking it to design and code a casual game that might be popular during the coming Lunar New Year holiday. The system generated a plain-looking but playable game in which users receive fortunes falling from the top of the screen.\n\nByteDance's new project comes after Big Tech rival Alibaba Group Holding earlier this month launched its own AI coding assistant. The e-commerce and cloud computing firm touts its Tongyi Lingma as capable of building an application \"in minutes\".\n\nThe system is powered by Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models - the technology behind generative AI services like ChatGPT - and improves the efficiency of code development by a factor of 10, according to the company. On Tuesday, Alibaba Cloud announced that the system can now access its latest Qwen2.5 model.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "article_content": "Research suggests dark energy may make up a vast amount of the universe, yet know one has determined what it is. Now, research suggests dark energy may be an illusion that arises from cosmic voids.\n\nDark energy, the mysterious force that's driving the accelerating expansion of the universe, may not actually exist, scientists say. Their research has brought into question one of the cornerstones of modern cosmology.\n\nIn a new study, published Dec. 19, 2024 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , the researchers analyzed data from the Pantheon+ survey \u2014 the most comprehensive dataset of type Ia supernovae, whose consistent brightness allows astronomers to measure distances across the universe with incredible precision. Their analysis suggests that what we perceive as acceleration might be an illusion caused by the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\nStudying the universe with type Ia supernovae\n\nType Ia supernovae, the explosive deaths of white dwarf stars, have long served as one of cosmology's most powerful tools. These stellar events occur when a white dwarf accretes enough material from a companion star to trigger a thermonuclear explosion. Because type 1a supernovae produce consistent peak brightness, measuring their brightness when observed from Earth can reveal how far away they are.\n\n\"Type Ia supernovae are extremely valuable in astronomy since they act as standardizable candles with which we can measure vast distances in the Universe,\" study co-author Zachary Lane , a researcher at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told Live Science in an email.\n\nBy combining this distance information with the redshift of the supernovae \u2014 the stretching of light to redder wavelengths due to the universe's expansion \u2014 scientists have mapped the universe's growth over time. Decades ago, researchers used this method to show that the universe's expansion was accelerating, a discovery that led to the hypothesis of dark energy \u2014 a mysterious, unseen force thought to permeate space and drive this acceleration.\n\nPantheon+ dataset\n\nThe Pantheon+ dataset is the most extensive and precise collection of type Ia supernovae ever assembled. Spanning decades of observations from both ground-based and space telescopes, it contains data on 1,500 supernovae across space-time.\n\n\"At the time of this study, the Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae spectroscopic dataset was the largest and most pristine collection of purely Type Ia supernovae,\" Lane said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Its detailed records of brightness and redshift offer unparalleled insights into how the universe has evolved, providing a critical testing ground for alternative theories to the standard cosmological model.\n\nChallenging dark energy\n\nWhile the idea of dark energy explains much of the observed acceleration in the universe, it has always carried an air of mystery. Dark energy has never been directly detected, nor has its origin been explained theoretically, prompting some scientists to explore other explanations.\n\nThe new study takes aim at a key assumption of the standard model: that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, meaning it looks the same in every direction and from every vantage point.\n\nThis assumption underpins the need for dark energy to explain the universe's expansion. However, Lane and his colleagues tested an alternative idea called the timescape model, which suggests that the apparent acceleration could be a byproduct of cosmic structures like voids \u2014 vast, near-empty regions of space between galaxy clusters.\n\n\"The standard model of cosmology is built on the assumption that the Universe is uniform and featureless on large scales and that cosmic structures do not significantly impact the evolution of the Universe,\" Lane said. \"Timescape abandons these assumptions and finds that the apparent acceleration of the Universe is the result of feedback between cosmic structures.\"\n\nBecause of their sparse matter and gravity, voids expand faster than denser parts of the universe, such as galaxy clusters. According to the timescape model, the dominance of these voids in the cosmic landscape could explain the observed acceleration without the need for dark energy.\n\nEvidence in favor of timescape\n\nThe team analyzed the Pantheon+ dataset and found that their results align remarkably well with the timescape model \u2014 and in some cases even outperformed the standard cosmological model.\n\n\"When considering every supernova, including those very close to us in the Milky Way, which could be influenced by local structures, we find very strong preference in favor of the Timescape model,\" Lane said. When supernovae in the nearby universe were excluded to account for local differences, the evidence remained supportive, echoing findings from the Dark Energy Survey (DES).\n\nThese results pose a direct challenge to the necessity of dark energy. \"Consistently finding moderate or stronger evidence for a cosmological model without dark energy using one of the most historically significant observational methods is an exciting prospect to be explored for the future of cosmology,\" Lane said.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWhile the findings are compelling, Lane stressed that further research is needed to solidify the case for timescape. \"While other factors need to be considered for this to be more established within the cosmology community, it proves a promising initial test,\" he said.\n\nIn the future, the team plans to combine the Pantheon+ dataset with data from the Dark Energy Survey and baryon acoustic oscillations \u2014 patterns in the distribution of galaxies that can be used as another cosmic ruler. The astronomers are also conducting simulations of how voids expand under the framework of general relativity and exploring how these effects apply to galaxy formation and evolution.\n\n\"Our research group is exploring several extensions to our current work, aiming to challenge foundational aspects of cosmology,\" Lane said. \"A strong competing framework will still enhance the future of cosmology and our current understanding of the challenges facing the field.\""

            "article_content": "The internet has become a cornerstone of modern life, offering unparalleled connectivity and convenience. However, this interconnectedness also brings significant risks, with malicious URLs serving as a primary vehicle for cyberattacks. These harmful links can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage for individuals and organizations alike.\n\nIn their study, \"Securing Web by Predicting Malicious URLs,\" Imran Khan and Meenakshi Megavarnam from the University of Hertfordshire propose an innovative model that integrates machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict malicious URLs effectively. Published in the Journal of Cyber Security, 6(1), 117\u2013130, this research highlights a hybrid approach combining Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms to enhance cybersecurity measures.\n\nThe challenge of malicious URLs\n\nMalicious URLs are among the most common vectors for cyberattacks, enabling phishing, malware distribution, and data theft. Traditional URL filtering methods often struggle to keep up with the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, necessitating more robust and adaptive solutions. The study emphasizes that predicting malicious URLs is critical for strengthening web security, especially as cyber threats become more sophisticated and widespread.\n\nThe authors note that existing methods, while effective to a degree, often focus on either machine learning or deep learning individually. Their research aims to address this gap by leveraging the strengths of both approaches to create a more efficient and accurate model.\n\nThe research introduces a hybrid model that combines the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, known for its accuracy in handling complex datasets, with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which excels in capturing intricate patterns through deep learning. This fusion allows the model to benefit from the strengths of both approaches - RF\u2019s precision and MLP\u2019s ability to learn complex data representations.\n\nThe study utilized a dataset from Kaggle containing over 651,000 URLs categorized into benign, malware, defacement, and phishing types. After preprocessing the data to remove null and duplicate values and applying label encoding, the researchers trained the hybrid model. The results demonstrated an accuracy of 81%, with a training time of 33.78 seconds, making the model both effective and efficient.\n\nPerformance metrics and results\n\nThe researchers evaluated the hybrid model using several performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The confusion matrix revealed that the RF-MLP model performed consistently across all categories, effectively identifying malicious URLs while minimizing false positives and false negatives.\n\nCompared to individual algorithms like Decision Tree (DT), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and standalone MLP, the hybrid model showed superior performance. The RF algorithm achieved an accuracy of 87%, and MLP reached 82%, but their combination delivered a balanced accuracy of 81% with faster validation and testing times.\n\nThe hybrid model particularly excelled in identifying malware and defacement URLs, achieving F1 scores of 93% and 83%, respectively. However, it showed slightly lower effectiveness in detecting phishing URLs, an area the researchers suggest as a focus for future improvements.\n\nAdvantages of the hybrid approach\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of this study is its demonstration of how combining machine learning and deep learning can overcome the limitations of each approach when used individually. The hybrid model balances accuracy with computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for real-time applications.\n\nThe model\u2019s ability to process large datasets quickly makes it suitable for deployment in scenarios where timely threat detection is critical, such as enterprise firewalls and content filtering systems. Additionally, its adaptability ensures that it can keep pace with the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats.\n\nThe study provides an in-depth comparison with alternative methods, including models based on Adaboost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Variational Autoencoders (VAE). While some of these approaches achieved higher accuracy (e.g., VAE-DNN at 97.45% accuracy), they often required significantly longer training times or lacked the adaptability of the RF-MLP hybrid.\n\nBy emphasizing a balance between performance and practicality, the hybrid model offers a compelling alternative, particularly for organizations that require fast and reliable threat detection without excessive computational overhead.\n\nApplications and implications\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond academic interest. Organizations can integrate the RF-MLP hybrid model into their cybersecurity frameworks to enhance their defenses against malicious URLs. From web browsers implementing real-time URL filtering to enterprises strengthening their network security, the potential applications are vast.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights the importance of adopting machine learning and deep learning in tandem to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges. Policymakers and industry leaders can use these insights to guide investments in AI-driven security solutions, fostering a safer digital environment for all users.\n\nFuture directions\n\nWhile the hybrid model demonstrates significant promise, the researchers acknowledge areas for further exploration. Improving the model\u2019s accuracy in detecting phishing URLs, for instance, remains a priority. Future research could also explore integrating additional data sources, such as DNS records and IP reputation, to enhance predictive capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the study advocates for broader adoption of open-source datasets and collaborative efforts among researchers to develop more comprehensive solutions. As cyber threats evolve, continuous innovation will be essential to stay ahead of malicious actors."

Today, the dynamics of great-power competition and regional instability suggest that the world has not left these patterns behind but is instead witnessing their resurgence in new forms. The growing rivalry between the United States and China has been described as a \u2018Cold War II\u2019, evoking comparisons to the ideological and strategic tensions of the mid-20th century. At the same time, discussions of a potential \u2018World War III\u2019, once confined to speculative fiction, have entered the realm of serious analysis among policymakers and academics. These concerns are not abstract."

            "article_content": "Sharing Data Makes Every Agency Stronger\n\nIn the realm of public safety and security, the integration of open architecture surveillance systems promises to significantly enhance interagency collaboration and operational efficiency.\n\nOpen architecture surveillance dissolves traditional barriers of proprietary systems, enabling a seamless flow of information among public sector entities, including law enforcement, emergency services, municipal administrations and even private sector organizations.\n\nThe collaborations that stem from these central, shared insights foster a unified approach to public safety that helps all factions involved do more with less. This, in turn, augments the collective capacity to respond to emergencies, manage resources and ensure safer cities.\n\nRELATED: Law enforcement agencies and utilities will digitize physical security in 2025.\n\nData-Driven Decision-Making Enhances Law Enforcement Outcomes\n\nIn 2019, law enforcement in Canada deployed a real-time intelligent center that integrates various streams of information, including live surveillance footage from stationary or body-worn cameras, social media monitoring, actionable insights, data analytics and other intelligence sources. This stream of data provides law enforcement officers with improved awareness into ongoing incidents and potential threats.\n\nBeyond law enforcement, these centers often support broader public safety efforts, including emergency response coordination, disaster management and event security planning. For example, officers can work with other units, government entities and private organizations to centrally access aggregated event video feeds, data analytics and intelligence that may indicate emerging threats or criminal activities. This allows for a swift and unified response to incidents, where personnel are better equipped and directed where they are most needed.\n\nWith open architecture, surveillance systems shift toward interoperability and flexibility, and devices such as sensors, infrared cameras and even lighting controls can all run on the same communication protocol.\n\nIn the U.S., Project Green Light Detroit similarly uses open architecture and seamless collaboration between public and private entities. The Detroit Police Department initiated the project in 2016, partnering with eight gas stations equipped with real-time camera connections to police headquarters. The innovative public-private community partnership enhances neighborhood safety, supports local businesses and strengthens crime prevention efforts.\n\nOver the years, participants have installed high-definition cameras, upgraded network connections and improved lighting on their properties. The police department and the city provide staff to monitor and analyze video feeds in the real-time crime center.\n\nLEARN MORE: Moving physical security to the cloud boosts efficiency.\n\nSharing Resources Yields a Reduced Environmental Impact\n\nAnother key benefit of open architecture systems is that they allow multiple agencies to share surveillance infrastructure and data, reducing the need for each entity to deploy its own hardware. This collaborative approach can decrease the environmental impact associated with manufacturing, operating and disposing of electronic surveillance equipment. Open architecture systems also allow for the use of cloud-based services and more efficient data centers, which consume less energy compared with traditional, decentralized systems.\n\nOpen architecture systems are also inherently flexible and scalable, allowing for easier updates and integration of new technologies without complete system overhauls. For example, you can add features such as network speakers to improve communication and even provide verbal warnings to deter certain behaviors. Network intercoms can provide audiovisual identification and remote entry control.\n\nOther examples might include body-worn solutions for private security and law enforcement, analytics to improve operator efficiency, radar to follow intruders, and even strobe sirens for safety and deterrence.\n\nLater expansion of the systems would make it possible to extend the lifespan of existing infrastructure while reducing waste and demand for new materials.\n\nDIVE DEEPER: State and local governments can build data centers sustainably.\n\nCost Sharing Minimizes Expenditures\n\nThe collaborative nature of open architecture surveillance allows for cost sharing among participating units, government agencies and organizations. This can include shared expenses for acquisition, maintenance and upgrades. The net results of cost sharing include significant savings and more efficient use of public funds.\n\nAgencies and entities that buy in will ultimately experience a higher ROI. They can integrate and upgrade systems as needed without replacing entire setups, which helps ensure that investments remain valuable over a longer period, further contributing to economic sustainability.\n\nIn the end, public agencies and law enforcement can optimize their use of available resources through the sharing of surveillance data and open architecture systems. This leads to more efficient deployment of personnel and equipment, further reducing unnecessary expenditures and environmental impact.\n\nAdhering to Privacy and Data Protection Requirements\n\nWhile the benefits are substantial, the implementation of open architecture surveillance systems is not without challenges; in particular, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity need to be placed front and center to safeguard all data in transit among agencies and other entities, and at rest.\n\nNevertheless, the transition to open architecture surveillance systems represents a forward-thinking approach to public sector operations and safety. By overcoming the limitations of siloed, proprietary systems, agencies can enhance their collaborative efforts, operational efficiency and, ultimately, their service to the community.\n\nWith that in mind, this transition requires a commitment to technological innovation, but the principles of privacy, security and ethical governance must remain priorities. As we move forward, the main goal should remain leveraging technology to serve the public good, ensuring safer, more secure and united cities and towns.\n\nUP NEXT: Cybersecurity mesh strengthens security for state and local governments."

            "article_content": "With the advent of Zero Trust architecture, where the principle of \u201cnever trust, always verify\u201d prevails, the importance of comprehensive access control has never been more pronounced. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, organizations are turning to advanced access control mechanisms to safeguard their sensitive data and assets.\n\nUnified Access Control (UAC) is at the forefront of this movement, enhancing enterprise security through three foundational pillars: Simplicity, Automation, and Insight. By embracing UAC, organizations can fortify their defenses, streamline security processes, and gain unparalleled visibility into their security landscape.\n\nWhat is Unified Access Control?\n\nUnified Access Control (UAC) is a comprehensive security framework designed to manage and enforce access policies across an organization\u2019s entire digital environment. UAC provides robust access control capabilities for enterprise networks, applications, and infrastructure, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access critical resources.\n\nKey technologies that make up UAC include:\n\nNetwork Access Control (NAC), which governs access to network resources based on predefined security policies;\n\nConditional Access, which applies contextual rules to determine user access to specific SaaS and on-premises applications based on factors such as user role, device health, and location; and\n\nTACACS+, a protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for managing network devices and ensuring secure access to network infrastructure.\n\nTogether, these capabilities deliver a unified and cohesive approach to access control, significantly enhancing the security posture of enterprise environments.\n\nPillar #1 of UAC is Simplicity: Reducing User Friction & Enhancing Experience\n\nOne of the primary challenges in enterprise security is balancing robust protection with a seamless user experience. Traditional security measures often involve complex passwords, multifactor authentication, and cumbersome access protocols, which can frustrate users and hinder productivity. UAC addresses this challenge by embracing simplicity, making security both effective and user-friendly.\n\nPasswordless Authentication\n\nPasswordless authentication is at the forefront of UAC\u2019s simplicity pillar. By eliminating the need for traditional passwords, UAC reduces the risk of password-related breaches, which are a common entry point for cyber attackers. Instead, users can leverage biometrics, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, or hardware tokens for secure access. This not only enhances security but also streamlines the user experience, allowing employees to access the resources they need with minimal friction.\n\nCloud-Native Architecture\n\nAdopting a cloud-native architecture is another critical aspect of UAC\u2019s simplicity. Cloud-native solutions offer scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration, enabling organizations to deploy and manage their access control systems with greater efficiency. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, UAC can be seamlessly integrated with existing enterprise systems, providing a unified platform for managing access across various applications and environments.\n\nSeamless Integration\n\nSeamless integration is essential for reducing complexity in access control. UAC solutions are designed to work harmoniously with existing security frameworks and applications, minimizing disruption and ensuring a smooth transition. This integration capability allows organizations to consolidate their security measures into a single, cohesive system, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.\n\nPillar #2 of UAC is Automation: Streamlining Security Processes & Response\n\nIn the realm of enterprise security, automation is a game-changer. By automating routine security tasks and responses, UAC enables organizations to enhance their security posture while reducing the burden on IT and security teams. Automation ensures that security measures are consistently applied, reducing the risk of human error and enabling faster, more effective responses to threats.\n\nUser Segmentation\n\nUser segmentation is a key component of UAC\u2019s automation capabilities. By categorizing users based on roles, departments, or risk profiles, UAC can apply tailored security policies that align with each user\u2019s specific needs and risk level. This segmentation allows for granular control over access permissions, ensuring that users only have access to the resources necessary for their roles while minimizing the attack surface.\n\nDevice Remediation\n\nAutomation in UAC also extends to device remediation. With the proliferation of mobile and remote work, managing and securing a diverse array of devices is a significant challenge. UAC solutions can automatically detect and remediate devices that do not comply with security policies, such as those lacking the latest updates or running unauthorized applications. This proactive approach ensures that only secure, compliant devices can access the network, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.\n\nAutomated Device Onboarding\n\nSelf-onboarding capabilities further streamline the security process. By allowing users to self-register their devices and configure them according to security policies, UAC reduces the administrative overhead on IT teams. Automated onboarding processes ensure that devices are properly configured and secure from the outset, enhancing overall security and user satisfaction.\n\nPillar #3 of UAC is Insight: Providing Comprehensive Visibility and Control\n\nIn the modern threat landscape, visibility and control are paramount. UAC provides organizations with deep insights into their security posture, enabling proactive threat management and informed decision-making. By continuously monitoring and assessing risks, UAC ensures that security measures are both dynamic and adaptive.\n\nContinuous Risk Assessment\n\nContinuous risk assessment is a critical component of UAC\u2019s insight pillar. By constantly evaluating user behavior, device health, and network activity, UAC can identify potential threats in real-time. This ongoing assessment allows for dynamic adjustments to security policies, ensuring that the organization remains protected against emerging threats. Continuous monitoring also provides a comprehensive view of the security landscape, enabling faster detection and response to incidents.\n\nDevice Profiling\n\nDevice profiling enhances visibility by creating detailed profiles of all devices accessing the network. These profiles include information on device type, operating system, compliance status, and usage patterns. By maintaining up-to-date profiles, UAC can identify anomalies and potential security risks associated with specific devices. This granular level of detail enables organizations to implement targeted security measures and mitigate risks more effectively.\n\nRole- and Location-Based Access\n\nRole- and location-based access control further enhances security by aligning access permissions with specific user roles and geographical locations. UAC can enforce access policies based on the user\u2019s role within the organization and their physical location, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized personnel in appropriate contexts. This contextual approach to access control minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\nUAC Represents a Paradigm Shift in Security\n\nUnified Access Control is more than just a security solution; it is a strategic approach to safeguarding enterprise assets in an increasingly complex digital environment. By leveraging the three pillars of Simplicity, Automation, and Insight, UAC transforms traditional access control into a dynamic, adaptive, and comprehensive security framework.\n\nUnified Access Control represents a paradigm shift in enterprise security. By embracing simplicity, automation, and insight, organizations can enhance their security posture, reduce vulnerabilities, and achieve a higher level of protection for their valuable assets. UAC is not just about managing access; it is about creating a secure, resilient, and adaptive security environment that can keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDenny LeCompte, the CEO of Portnox, is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations and strategic direction of the company.

The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) has identified the site as a significant Roman and Byzantine-era location, possibly a monastery.\n\nThe site, which dates back to the fifth or sixth century C.E., reveals a wealth of artifacts, including a winepress, a large warehouse, and imported goods like metal, glass containers, coins, and marble objects. Excavation managers Shira Lifshitz and Maayan Margulis told Smithsonian Magazine that the site is \u201cThe largest and most significant discovery in the region from the Roman and Byzantine periods.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor, located in what is believed to be the monastery\u2019s main aisle, features intricate designs of crosses, lions, doves, flowers, geometric patterns, and an amphora (an ancient jug). These artistic elements, combined with the Biblical inscription, suggest the site was of considerable importance.\n\nThe site was continuously occupied from the early Roman period (around the first century C.E.) to the late Byzantine period in the sixth century. Archaeologists believe its first human activity may date back 6,000 years to the Chalcolithic era.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on the spread of Christianity during the Byzantine Empire\u2019s golden age. Following Emperor Constantine I\u2019s conversion to Christianity in the fourth century C.E., the Byzantine Empire became a hub of religious and cultural development.\n\nThe IAA continues to work on preserving the site and its artifacts, offering invaluable insights into the history of the region."

Elspeth Hayes\n\n6\n\nBut now, scientists have revealed they are actually ancient monuments crafted by Aboriginal people called the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung - the traditional owners of the land.\n\nTheir findings were described in a new study published in Australian Archaeology.\n\nResearchers estimate there were once over 400 of these structures across New South Wales and Queensland in eastern Australia, but only around 100 remain today.\n\nFar fewer have ever been discovered in the southern-most state of Victoria, but the five around the town of Sunbury are amongst them.\n\nMany other rings of this kind are thought to have been destroyed by European settlers when they colonised the land.\n\nIt is believed the ancient people would dig out earth and build it into mounds that formed the large circles, hundreds of metres across, that are still visible today.\n\nIt is also now understood the circles continue to be very important historically and culturally to Aboriginal people today.\n\nElders of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung culture explained that the rings are used to reflect on themes including the European occupation, colonisation, self-determination, adaptation and resilience of the people.\n\nPrevious studies had indicated that the sites were associated with sacred locations, but had not unearthed any of the cultural value now understood.\n\nThe Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people led a new archaeological excavation of one of the rings, known as Sudbury Ring G, in 2022, which has allowed these new revelations.\n\nPompeii bombshell as analysis of mummies may reveal who they REALLY are\n\nRing G is thought to be a ceremonial meeting spot for Aboriginal ancestors and was first excavated in 1979 by archaeologist David Frankel.\n\nSome 166 artefacts were unearthed in this initial dig, and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people also led the re-analysis of these.\n\nThis involved dating the ring deposits to estimate when it was created, and studying wear patterns to understand how the ancient people used stone tools.\n\n6 Some 166 artefacts were found in the dig of Sunbury Ring G Credit: Caroline Spry/Australian Archaeology\n\n6 The Aboriginal ancestors of those who built the ring led the re-analysis of these stone remnants Credit: Caroline Spry/Australian Archaeology\n\nThe study revealed that the ring was constructed somewhere between 590 and 1,400 years ago.\n\nIt showed that the people spent time in the area clearing the land and plants, scraping back soil and layering rocks.\n\nThey also lit campfires, made stone tools and moved items around in the ring's interior.\n\nWear patterns and residues on some of the tools suggest Woi-wurring people people may have used them to to create feather adornments and scar human skin for ceremony and decoration.\n\nThe scientists behind the study said in Live Science: \"[the research] expands our understanding of the richness and diversity of Australia's archaeological record, created over more than 65,000 years of continuous occupation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\".\n\nThey added: \"[The study] demonstrates the importance of further investigating and preserving these earth rings, as well as others known to occur across eastern Australia.\n\n\"This is especially important in the face of continued threats by land development and climate change which threaten the survival of earth rings.\""

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

Now, these mysterious phenomena are moving out of the shadows and into the light, as NASA pledges to study them scientifically. So, what exactly does science have to say on the matter?\n\nThis new NOVA investigation looks at the evidence from every angle, marshaling expert opinions from physicists, engineers, cosmologists, and others who are bringing new technologies and heightened rigor to solving these mysteries. How can new ground-based sensors and crowdsourcing of data help explain what military pilots and others have seen? Many of these sightings can be attributed to physical objects like balloons or drones, weather phenomena, or optical illusions, but others so far remain mysterious. What other potential explanations remain? Could they be the result of secret new technologies developed by other governments \u2014 or our own? And what would it take for alien engineers to traverse vast distances to send probes or visit Earth from other solar systems?\n\nFilmmaker Quote:\n\n\u201cWe are living in an age of conspiracy, and we need facts now more than ever,\u201d said Producer, Director and Writer Terri Randall. \u201cThis film is able to address some of the viewer's most urgent questions about UFOs from a scientific perspective. There is so much taboo and confusion surrounding the topic, and while there is still so much we don\u2019t know, science can help us say, \u2018this might not be as scary as we think.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe public fascination with UFOs began to grow after pilot Kenneth Arnold spotted something strange as he flew near Mount Rainier, WA in 1947. He described objects glinting off the sun and moving as if they were skipping off of water, and hence the term flying saucer was coined. This famed sighting, along with many others, ignited public interest with more and more sightings being reported. During this post-World War II period, military technology was also developing at a rapid pace \u2014 often in secret \u2014 which could account for some of the bizarre objects people were seeing in the sky, including the infamous military balloon crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.\n\nSince this balloon\u2019s technology was top secret at the time, the U.S. Army announced that it was just a conventional weather balloon. But the public didn\u2019t buy that explanation, and the government\u2019s lack of answers created a void, which Hollywood saw as an opportunity, and entertainment featuring flying saucers and dramatic alien invasions proliferated.\n\nBehind the scenes, the military continued to investigate these phenomena. In 1969 the Air Force ended Project Blue Book, which documented investigations of more than 12,000 UFO sightings with 701 of the cases remaining unidentified. But for scientists, not being able to explain so much of the data findings is unacceptable, which along with the pop culture hysteria around UFOs created an environment where the scientific community did not want to touch the topic. Because of this enduring stigma, NASA now refers to UFOs as UAPs: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d features firsthand accounts from former Lt. US Navy and F/A-18F pilot Ryan Graves, whose squadron witnessed the famed \u201cGimbal\u201d \u2014 the first UAP video to be declassified by the Department of Defense \u2014 aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015. Graves was also the first active-duty military pilot to come forward about regular sightings of UFOs.\n\nThe film also introduces viewers to the U.S. Naval Officer and F/A-18F pilot Alex Dietrich, who in 2004 as a young aviator in training, witnessed what is considered to be one of the most important UAP encounters known as the USS Nimitz-Tic-Tac. Videos of both of these encounters were finally released to the public in 2017 when The New York Times published a landmark article on UAPs. It created a massive media frenzy which captured the attention of members of Congress who began to demand transparency. The science community took notice as well, but scientific investigation demands evidence \u2014 presenting a myriad of obstacles in this regard.\n\nWATCH: Navy pilot describes encounter with 'Tic Tac' shaped unidentified flying object\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d features interviews with several of the distinguished scientists that NASA brought together to examine the UFO mystery:\n\n\n\nThe film documents an experiment from Semester and Kirkpatrick examining how the elusive nature of infrared light could be the key to solving the mystery of why some UAPs seem to appear and then disappear in these viral videos captured by military pilots.\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d goes on to examine why the US government continued to be so elusive about rumored UFO sightings for many decades. It turned out that the debris a rancher found in Roswell, New Mexico back in 1947 was part of a classified program called Project Mogul where the Air Force launched balloons with sensors that could measure vibrations in order to monitor Russian nuclear testing.\n\nIt took half a century for the Air Force to admit the truth, but these misidentified radar reflectors likely accounted for what became the famed flying saucers. As many people believed, there was indeed a government coverup, but it was of a classified project and not of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The government\u2019s secrecy fed into conspiracy theories and allowed people to come up with wild explanations for these sightings.\n\nGovernment secrecy also contributed to mythbuilding around the infamous research facility Area 51, which the military did not acknowledge existed until 2013. Since the 1950s, this top-secret research facility was used to test advanced military technology including F-117, SR-71 and B2 Spirit stealth aircraft. But from a military perspective, confusion around these mysterious reported \u201calien sightings\u201d created a mythical smokescreen that also helpfully hid the advanced technologies the US military was testing from adversary nations.\n\nThe film includes differing perspectives from Alejandro Rojas, a UFO journalist from Enigma Labs; Jacob Haqq-Misra, an astrobiologist for the Blue Marble Space Institute; Michael Wong, Planetary Scientist from the Carnegie Institute for Science; Hakeem Oluysei, an astrophysicist from George Mason University; and UAP/UFO investigator Mick West who takes viewers through some common sense experiments that may debunk some of the viral videos captured by some of the best pilots in the world.\n\nVideogame Science and UFOs with Mick West\n\nWatch On Your Schedule: \u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d will be available for streaming at pbs.org/nova, NOVA on YouTube, the PBS Documentaries Prime Video Channel, and the PBS app, available on iOS, Android, Roku streaming devices, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung Smart TV, Chromecast and VIZIO.\n\nCredits: A NOVA production by Terri Randall Productions.

            "article_content": "A decade ago humanity launched around 200 objects into space per year. Now we launch more than 2,600, with no prospects for slowing down. This rapid expansion of human activity in outer space has filled Earth orbit with space trash, from dead satellites to used-up rocket parts. The region is already so crowded that working satellites run the risk of colliding with bits of garbage from previous generations of spacecraft. Even the International Space Station often has to adjust its orbit to dodge debris.\n\nCurrently there are more than 25,000 pieces of trackable human-made junk larger than 10 centimeters orbiting Earth. The more we put up there, the greater the chance that pieces of debris (traveling at relative speeds up to 15 times faster than a bullet) will strike working spacecraft, creating even more dangerous trash. The catastrophic collision in 2009 between the defunct Russian satellite Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium satellite, for example, generated nearly 2,000 debris fragments, many of which are still being tracked today.\n\nOrbital space is a finite resource, and it\u2019s rapidly being consumed by a few organizations, notably SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper. SpaceX, for instance, owns and operates the majority of all working satellites, and the company aims to launch tens of thousands more satellites to provide global broadband Internet coverage. Similarly, Amazon plans to deploy 3,236 satellites for its broadband network.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nGiving everyone unfettered access without global coordination and planning means that eventually no one may be able to use it.\n\nIf we keep up this pace, orbital space will become unusable\u2014especially the most popular region, low Earth orbit (LEO), which extends up to 2,000 kilometers in altitude. When looking at all orbital regions, we may lose services we\u2019ve come to rely on: continuous communications, GPS mapping, Internet, Earth monitoring, and more. Today nearly every satellite that is launched is equivalent to a piece of single-use plastic, in that its fate is to become detritus. We are heading toward a tragedy of the commons in orbital space: giving everyone unfettered access without global coordination and planning means that eventually no one may be able to use it.\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration and commercialization, there is a growing movement to rethink our approach to using the space environment\u2014to move to a strategy anchored in stewardship and sound waste-management principles. I believe we must leave behind our \u201clinear space economy,\u201d where we use and abandon, and move toward a \u201ccircular space economy\u201d\u2014a sustainable way to use space that emphasizes the reuse, recycling, and efficient management of space resources.\n\nJust as we are reckoning with how to conserve ecosystems on Earth for future living creatures, we must think of space as an environment worthy of preservation. In fact, reforming how we operate in space is critical for Earth conservation.\n\nThe production, launch and operation of satellites and rockets consume vast amounts of resources and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Rocket launches release pollutants into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, soot and aluminum oxides, which cause atmospheric damage and contribute to climate change.\n\nMoreover, the practice of uncontrolled reentries, where defunct satellites and rocket stages are allowed to burn up in the atmosphere, adds to atmospheric pollution and creates the risk of debris falling on people and property on Earth. In 2024, for instance, pieces of a SpaceX Dragon service module, including one about the size of a standard car hood, landed in the mountains of North Carolina, and a castoff part of the International Space Station fell through the roof of a house in Naples, Fla.\n\nThe ClearSpace-1 mission is due to launch in 2025 to rendezvous with a piece of a Vega rocket. This illustration shows ClearSpace-1 capturing the debris with robotic arms. The mission will aim to drag the rocket part down to burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. ClearSpace SA\n\nA circular space economy would represent a paradigm shift toward sustainable space practices, drawing inspiration from circular economy ideas that are gaining traction here on Earth. \u201cCircularity\u201d in this sense refers to waste-management principles calling for the end of life of a product to be designed for the object\u2019s reuse or recycling. The first step is to design spacecraft using materials that minimize pollution and generate less waste. The second is to repair satellites\u2019 broken parts in orbit to extend their life cycles. The third is to recycle materials from defunct satellites for use on new missions, without having to bring the satellites back to Earth. And finally, we must retrieve and reprocess space debris to reduce collision risks and reclaim valuable components.\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to enact a circular space economy without some technological innovations. We don\u2019t currently have techniques to service all spacecraft in orbit, although several companies and space agencies are working on it. We must create technology to extend satellites\u2019 operational lifespans and reduce the need for costly and resource-intensive replacement missions. We need spacecraft that can approach aging satellites and dock with them, using robots to repair, refuel and upgrade them.\n\nSpace exploration also raises fundamental ethical questions about fair resource extraction, ownership and environmental stewardship.\n\nWe\u2019ll also need a way to reuse and recycle satellites when their working lives are over. Currently all satellites become trash when their primary mission ends, and new satellites are built from entirely new materials. It\u2019s a huge waste, much like our junkyards for used cars and other vehicles. Researchers are working on ways to harvest materials from dead spacecraft to integrate into new vehicles and to use techniques to build new satellites out of used parts.\n\nA positive step in this direction is the reusable rocket technology SpaceX is developing. The boosters of their Falcon 9 rockets, for instance, can land vertically after being jettisoned in space after launch, allowing them to fly again. Not only does this save money\u2014recycling boosters reduces the cost of each Falcon 9 launch by up to 30 percent\u2014it generates less trash. But so far SpaceX is the only company or agency launching satellites with reusable rockets. We need more.\n\nThere\u2019s also been movement toward servicing working satellites in orbit. Northrop Grumman\u2019s SpaceLogistics has developed a spacecraft, the Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV), to help aging satellites keep going. In 2020 it successfully docked with the Intelsat 901 satellite, which was running out of fuel, and began using its own thrusters and propellant to maneuver the joined craft, extending the Intelsat\u2019s operational life. A second MEV docked with another Intelsat spacecraft in 2021. When those satellites are ready to be retired, the MEVs can undock and move on to other spacecraft that need their help. Launching an MEV to aid an ailing craft costs about half to a quarter of the price of building and launching an entirely new satellite. In addition to saving money, in-\u00adorbit servicing reduces the frequency of new satellite launches, which in turn minimizes the accumulation of space debris and the greenhouse gas emissions that come with rocket launches.\n\nRemoving debris from orbit is another challenge. Different types of trash require different removal techniques, with many ideas coming from the fishing industry: some strategies use nets, others harpoons, and still others hooks. Each removal technology has limitations and works only for a subset of the objects that need to be fished out of orbital space. It\u2019s also really expensive to retrieve any kind of space trash because anything that is not being actively controlled in space is tumbling. This means that to grab something to remove it, you must either find a way to steady the space detritus or make your debris-removal satellite tumble along with it. Detumbling debris takes a lot of energy, which results in high propellant costs.\n\nJen Christiansen; Source: \u201cSatellite Statistics: Satellite and Debris Population,\u201d Jonathan\u2019s Space Report (data)\n\nNevertheless, some progress has been made. In 2021 a Tokyo-based company, Astroscale, ran the End-\u00adof-\u00adLife Services by Astroscale demonstration (ELSA-d) mission, which launched two satellites: one to simulate a dead spacecraft and a servicer satellite to remove it. The two craft successfully docked in orbit and then released, testing out a critical process for eventual debris removal. The company plans to run more tests with its Active Debris Removal by Astro\u00adscale-\u00adJapan (ADRAS-J) mission, which launched in 2024.\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA), partnering with start-up ClearSpace, is set to launch its ClearSpace-1 mission in 2028. ClearSpace-1 will use four robotic arms to grab onto the agency\u2019s PROBA-1 satellite and bring it safely out of orbit. The project aims not only to clean up space but also to develop the ability to target larger and more complex pieces of debris.\n\nFinally, more efficient propulsion technology allows spacecraft to use less fuel and last longer on their initial load. Electric propulsion systems, such as ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters, are newer technologies that offer higher efficiency and fuel economy compared with traditional chemical propulsion. These systems use electric power to ionize propellant and generate thrust, enabling spacecraft to achieve higher velocities and perform precise maneuvers over extended periods. Electric propulsion is already used by many working satellites and will become increasingly common.\n\nAs we design new technology to conserve space, we\u2019d do well to take inspiration from another kind of tech: Indigenous societies\u2019 traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). This kind of TEK emphasizes the importance of harmonious relationships between human activities and the environment. It shows us that we have to see space as an extension of our natural world, where resources must be managed wisely and responsibly.\n\nAn example of applying TEK ideas to modern space activities is a recent collaboration between the ESA and Indigenous groups in Australia to study the impacts of space debris on wildlife habitats. By respecting the wisdom of Indigenous communities, ESA not only advanced their scientific goals but also promoted a sustainable model that can be applied to future space missions.\n\nNew technology alone isn\u2019t enough to fix the space junk problem\u2014we\u2019ll need legal reform, too. The current global space policy is a patchwork of regulations that often lag behind technological advancements and the evolving needs of space activities. SpaceX, for instance, has faced regulatory challenges in deploying its reusable rockets because our laws haven\u2019t caught up with the technology. Fragmented regulations across different countries and regions also lead to inconsistencies and hinder international collaboration. And many existing space policies don\u2019t even address sustainable practices such as in-orbit servicing, space debris mitigation and responsible resource use.\n\nThe European Union is trying to pave the way by integrating sustainability principles into its space policies. The E.U. has streamlined licensing processes for satellite launches and in-orbit operations across member states and has allocated significant funding for research and development on dealing with space debris. The U.S., through its many government agencies, has begun working to streamline the licensing process as well. But most countries are dangerously far behind.\n\nGovernments have a strong hand to play in incentivizing companies to design and develop sustainable space systems. One way to do this would be to adopt what are called extended producer responsibility laws, which require companies to help manage the waste from the technology they produce. Perhaps governments could use a credit system to regulate the amount of space debris the industry is allowed to create. Laws could also incentivize the design, launch and operation of on-orbit recycling centers where aging and defunct satellites could be repurposed.\n\nUltimately the governments that permit spacecraft to be launched are liable for any damage their space objects may cause. So the responsibility for cleaning orbital space falls to governments, but none of them, including Russia, the U.S. or China, are establishing robust markets for space garbage pickup and removal services. Moreover, currently there is no legal mechanism to transfer this liability for damage from one launching state to another, making it complicated to put in place a space salvage law analogous to maritime policy. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space also plays a pivotal role in developing international space law and norms. Its Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines encourage member states to manage space debris and promote sustainable space operations. More than 100 countries have endorsed the guidelines, including the U.S. Yet guidelines are not enforceable laws in and of themselves\u2014they are merely suggestions.\n\nSpace exploration also raises fundamental ethical questions about fair resource extraction, ownership and environmental stewardship. Asteroid mining, for example, presents opportunities for accessing rare minerals and resources, although it also risks destroying the scientific and cultural heritage of celestial bodies. And space mining could destabilize global markets\u2014imagine mining an asteroid made out of platinum. Furthermore, who should be allowed to profit from the resources of asteroids\u2014is it fair for only certain countries, or certain billionaires, to grow even richer and more powerful from space commodities?\n\nOrganizations such as the International Institute of Space Law and the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs are trying to develop ethical guidelines for responsible ways to use space resources that emphasize transparency, international cooperation and sustainability. Initiatives such as the Space Sustainability Rating, which aims to certify space missions based on sustainable practices, could encourage companies and nations to act responsibly.\n\nPreserving the space environment for future generations is a moral imperative. In the short term, we must take immediate action to deal with the growing dangers of space junk. We need more funding for debris-tracking and debris-mitigation technologies. We must also start changing how we build and use satellites to waste fewer resources, produce less trash and pollution, and recycle more. A circular space economy is the only way to keep space usable indefinitely.\n\nIn the long term, fostering international cooperation\u2014and international treaties requiring sustainable space practices\u2014is critical. The Inter-\u00adAgency Space Debris Coordination Committee, an intergovernmental organization dedicated to combating the problem of orbital trash, is a promising step. Many space agencies, including NASA, China\u2019s National Space Administration and Roscosmos, are members. The ESA\u2019s Clean Space initiative is another smart approach to reducing space debris through technology development and policy changes.\n\nThe establishment of a circular space economy is not just an option but a necessity for the sustainable future of space exploration. By adopting the principles of reuse, recycling, and efficient resource management, we can lower the risks of space debris collisions, preserve resources, and ensure that outer space remains a viable domain for scientific discovery and commercial innovation. Policymakers, industry leaders, scientists and the global community must embrace a sustainable approach to our activities in Earth orbit, securing its potential for generations to come."
